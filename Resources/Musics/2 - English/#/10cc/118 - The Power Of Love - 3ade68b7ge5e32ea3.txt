THE POWER OF LOVE

Momma don't mind, cause your momma don't know
But if your poppa finds out that we're all alone
He's gonna change your mind and rearrange my bones 

Cause the power of love is like a tidal wave
It can pick you up and knock you on the floor
make you do the things you never done before 

Don't imagine that you're free
There's no escaping from reality
You're under the spell, under the power of love 

Turn the lights down low (lights down low)
And the hi fi high (hi fi high)
Put the lock on the door, pull the curtains too
Don't want the world to know, I'm getting close to you 

Well you never see it (never see it)
But you sure can feel it (sure can feel it)
And if you get the taste, you get the hunger pains
You'll be hooked for life, never be the same 

Everybody's gonna see
There's no escaping from the mystery
You're under the spell, under the power of love 

The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)

So you're sitting in a restaurant
And you feel so nonchalant
When the waiter says "what'll it be"
You start to speak, then suddenly
A pretty girl walks 'cross the floor
You ain't thinking 'bout food - no more 

'Cause the power of love is like a tidal wave
It can pick you up and knock you on the floor
make you do the things you never done before 

Don't imagine that you're free
There's no escaping from reality
You're under the spell, under the power of love 

The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)

[Repeat to fade]
