NOW YOU'RE GONE

You promised me a life
You promised me everything would change
Even said you'd be my wife
Ooh now you're gone 

You told me I was handsome
Even told me I was smart
And I believed every word you said
Ooh then you broke my heart 

I don't know why I was so hard of hearing
I only listened to what I wanted to
I couldn't see what was goin' on around me
You didn't need me
But I needed you
Ooh ooh 

Now everything has changed
The tables have been turned on me
It's all been rearranged
Like the setting sun
Ooh now you're gone 

I don't know why I was so hard of hearing
I only listened to what I wanted to
I couldn't see what was goin' on around me
You didn't need me
But I needed you
Ooh ooh 

Now I'm sittin' in the dark place
I got murder on my mind
Say goodbye to the rat race
No more setting sun
'Cause soon I'll be gone
