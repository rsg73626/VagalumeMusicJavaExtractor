WOMAN IN LOVE

I don't know why it's the way of the world
but meanwhile.... 

you've seen her sway when she walks down the street
look at her eyes see the glow in her cheeks
it ain't no secret she can't hide it away
there's someone special she's the dish of the day 

she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman 

this chemistry you'll never find in a book
no Ectochrome's gonna capture this look
these mixed emo's make your senses to reel
you've got to be there to feel what she feels 

she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman 

why should a woman in all innocence
be the one to inspire looks that kill
I don't know
I don't know why it's the way of the world
some will win, some will lose
but she can't tell 

this kind of beauty comes from within
shouldn't be allowed yeh it's really a sin
you'd sell your soul for a night in her bed
you're far too late boy I've already said 

she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman 

[repeat until fade]
