WORKING GIRLS

Working girls don't stand a chance
Typing pools are full deadly fish
Office Romeos believe
Dictation is the statutory dish 

Do they want you for your body
When you wanna use your mind
Every day it's hustle hustle
But you're not the pushy kind 

You worry and wonder when he calls you at five
You've got to work late will you get out alive
You know what he's after it's always the same
And soon you'll be playing the cat and mouse game 

Working girls they dress to kill
Posing for some glossy magazine
You know the flashman wants an exposure
But your momma says you gotta keep it clean 

Still you're selling with your body
And the camera never lies
Every shot is more revealing
As your inhibitions die 

He asks you to stay but you want to decline
He leers as he opens another bottle of wine
Don't want to offend him your ticket to fame
So you play by the rules
It's a cat and mouse game 

Working girls are lost in dreams
Buried in a paperback romance
Why don't you wake up to reality
And watch those fingers at the office dance 

When you're struggling with your figures
Is he studying your form?
There's a silence in the boardroom
It's the calm before the storm 

You wanna go home it's been a long day
The streets are so crowded and you must get away
You'll be back tomorrow
He'll call out your name
It's business as usual
The cat and mouse game
