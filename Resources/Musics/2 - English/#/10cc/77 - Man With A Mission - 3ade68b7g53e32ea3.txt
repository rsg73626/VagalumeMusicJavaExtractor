MAN WITH A MISSION

There's a man at the top
And I know that he's pulling the strings
He's got his eye in the sky
And I know that he sees everything
There's a bug on the phone
Got his eye on the fly on the wall
But the man in the street doesn't know
'till the guillotine falls 

Then he drops before you realize
Bullets hit you right between the eyes 

I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in the door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 

There's a voice in the air
And you welcome it into your home
But the snake in the grass
Is the power behind the throne
While you sit in your castle
The enemy's scaling the wall
If you don't make a sound
There'll be no one to answer your call 

The evidence is there in black and white
Your number's up for grabs if you don't fight 

I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in the door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 

I'm a man with a mission
got an ace up my sleeve
I'm the man with a mission
And your trapped in the web that I weave 

Open your eyes - see the lies while you dance in the dirt
Open your eyes - to the lies while you still got a chance
Open your mind - and you find that you're locked in a trance
Stars in your eyes - they make you blind this is not a romance 

The evidence is there in black and white
How long will it take you to see the light? 

I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in your door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 

I'm a man with a mission
got an ace up my sleeve
I'm the man with a mission
And your trapped in the web that I weave I'm a man with a mission
Yeh, I'm a man with a mission
Ooh, I'm a man with a mission
I'm a man with a mission
