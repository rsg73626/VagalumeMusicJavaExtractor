YES, I AM

You never asked me to love you
I did it all by myself
You didn't make me no promises
You read my feelings so well 

[CHORUS]
Oh wow wow what you've done for me
Oh wow wow even a fool could see
Oh wow wow what you mean to me 

You didn't ask no questions
I wouldn't tell you no lies
I didn't need any answers
They were there in your eyes
Don't stop me from falling
I can't get enough
You took the pain from my body
Now I'm ready for love
Yes I am 

I've been alone in the shadows
Too many nights by myself
So many dreams have been shattered
You know the story so well 

[CHORUS]

I didn't see no fireworks
And the earth never moved
But when we're lying together
I've got nothing to prove
You gave me your kisses I can't get enough
You put the fire in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am 

People try to analyse
They worry is it right
But it really doesn't matter to me
There's no reason when you really fall in love
'Cause you can't stop it
Won't drop it
Don't even think about it
Hold on tight and never let it go 

[CHORUS]

You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am
