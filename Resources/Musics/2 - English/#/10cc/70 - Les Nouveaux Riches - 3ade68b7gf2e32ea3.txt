LES NOUVEAUX RICHES

I could see that the sun it was deadly
She's putting her hand in the fire
Her velvety skin it was cooking
Lily white, lily white turning to raspberry
But when she slips in between the sheets tonight
the memory will linger and burn
And when she look at the face in the mirror
What a terrible sight
Lily white turning to raspberry
(When it burns you rub on the lotion
if it stings you sit in the ocean, oh no) 

Les nouveaux riches, when they
tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
they set jet away, they don't
get a kick, they don't get a buzz man
they, talk in circles, they not for us oh
Les nouveaux riches, when they
tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
they hot foot away, they don't
get a buzz, they don't get a kick
man they, talk in circles
they must be thick, a say tick dem
a tick tick tick-a 

I could see that the guys were a hassle
She tried to handle them cool
But her interbreeding was showing
tumbling out on the banks of the old
swimming pool, oh oh oh
So she buried her fears in a bottle
the juices beginning to flow
But her stiff upper lip it was trembling
tripping her up, her words were beginning to roll
Hush your mouth, you can't fool the natives
telegraph, they's going to relay it, oh no 

Les nouveaux riches, when they
tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
they set jet away, they don't
get a kick, they don't get a buzz man
they, talk in circles, they not for us oh
Les nouveaux riches, when they
tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
they hot foot away, they don't
get a buzz, they don't get a kick
man they, talk in circles
they must be thick, a say tick dem
a tick tick tick-a 

I remember the tears in her eyes
She tried to hide them away
But her time it was going too quickly
Just another few days, she'll soon be flying away
But her memory will stay here forever
A time she will never forget
All the sun and the sand and the water
Such a beautiful place, she never got her feet wet
No way, she keeping a cool head
She got a tan, from under the sun bed, oh no 

Les nouveaux riches, when they
tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
they set jet away, they don't
get a kick, they don't get a buzz man
they, talk in circles, they not for us oh
Les nouveaux riches, when they
tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
they hot foot away, they don't
get a buzz, they don't get a kick
man they, talk in circles
they must be thick, a say tick dem
a tick tick tick-a
