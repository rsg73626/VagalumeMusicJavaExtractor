SOMETHING SPECIAL

stealing coins from the poor box
i'm robbing the blind, but you won't
understand, i'm a wanted man
got no choice in the matter
i'm mad as a hatter
but she makes me do
things i shouldn't do 

my baby wants the best of everything
i can't refuse her when she starts to sing
bring me something special
and i'll take you to heaven tonight 

going down to the street and
i'll pick on a pocket with a
healthy wad, from some wealthy sod
looking tough with a shooter
i'll stick up the bank
and take out, all that cash
i'll be, such a smash 

my baby needs the best of everything
lifes little luxuries to make her sing
bring me something special and i'll
take you to heaven tonight 

look at her face and i won't need to explain
this is the stuff dreams are made of
step in my shoes and you will feel no pain
she's got the power to knock your socks off 

my baby gets the best of everything
it's risky business but it makes her sing
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight 

bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight [2x]
