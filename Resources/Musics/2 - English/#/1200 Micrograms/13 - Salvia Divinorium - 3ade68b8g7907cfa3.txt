SALVIA DIVINORIUM

'This is a news flash folks, we interrupt this program to bring you the special announcement. A new psychoactive substance has been discovered. A very powerful psychoactive substance. The most powerful since the discovery of LSD.'
'A substance so powerful that 300 microgramms is the dose. That means 1 gramm will kill 7000 people.'
'Salvia - s.a.l.v.i.a and then Divinorum - d.i.v.i.n.o.r.u.m.- the diviner's mint.'
