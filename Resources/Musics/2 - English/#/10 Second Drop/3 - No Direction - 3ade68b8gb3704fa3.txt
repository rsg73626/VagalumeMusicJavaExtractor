NO DIRECTION

I 
Need to question why 
Voices in my mind 
Leave the doubt behind 

This part of life 
Its just those little things that 
Always make us cry 

I'm not buyin' what they're sellin' 
Don't believe the lies they're tellin' 
Can't find a reason nothing we're knowing 
Won't someone tell us where are we going now 

These long-forgotten dreams 
Silenced from our screams 
Never to be seen 

An' still we try 
We're always doin' what we have to 
Make it by 

I'm not buyin' what they're sellin' 
Don't believe the lies they're tellin' 
Can't find a reason nothing we're knowing 
Won't someone tell us where are we going now 

Where are we going now 
With no direction 

This part of life 
Its just those little things that 
Always make us cry 

I'm not buyin' what they're sellin' 
Don't believe the lies they're tellin' 
Can't find a reason nothing we're knowing 
Won't someone tell us where are we going now 

Where are we going now 
With no direction 

No direction now X3 
With no direction
