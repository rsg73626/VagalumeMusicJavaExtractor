ALWAYS THE VICTIM

Again your world is crashing 
In just the usual fashion 
You look for my compassion 
But I won't lend that to you anymore 
And I'm out of forgiveness 

Why should I waste my pity on you 
Don't need a fallout now 
Still you try to pretend 
That you're always the victim 

Wake up to see your friends are gone 
But think that you've done nothing wrong The same conclusions have been drawn You brought this whole mess on yourself again 
Now deal with the fallout 

Why should I waste my pity on you 
Don't need a fallout now 
Still you try to pretend 
That you're always the victim 

Why should I waste my pity on you 
Don't need a fallout now 
Still you try to pretend 
That you're always the victim 

And now it's all fucked up again 
It makes no difference in the end 
Its out of my head 
Its out of mind 

Why should I waste my pity on you 
Don't need a fallout now 
Still you try to pretend 
That you're always the victim
