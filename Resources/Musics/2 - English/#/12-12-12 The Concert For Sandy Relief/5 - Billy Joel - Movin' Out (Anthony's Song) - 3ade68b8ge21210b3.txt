BILLY JOEL - MOVIN' OUT (ANTHONY'S SONG)

Anthony works in the grocery store
Saving his pennies for someday.
Momma Leoni left a note on the door.
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country.
Working too hard can give you a heart attack;
You oughtta know by now.
Who need a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?"
It seems such a waste of time.
If that's what it's all about...
Mama, if that's moving up, then I'm moving out.

Seargeant O'Leary is walking the beat.
At night, he becomes a bartender.
He works at Mr. Cacciatorre's down on Sullivant Street,
Across from the medical center,
And he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac.
You oughtta know by now,
If he can't drive with a broken back,
At least he can polish the fenders.
And it seems such a waste of time,
If that's what it's all about...
Mama, if that's moving up, then I'm moving out.

You should never argue with a crazy mind.
You oughtta know by now,
And it seems such a waste of time.
If that's what it's all about...
Good luck moving up, cause I'm moving out.
