BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - WRECKING BALL

I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of jersey, 
Some misty years ago 
Through the mud and the beer, 
And the blood and the cheers, 
I've seen champions come and go 
So if you got the guts mister, yeah 
If you've got the balls if you think it's your time, 
Then step to the line, and bring on your wrecking ball

Bring on your wrecking ball 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Come on and take your best shot, 
Let me see what you've got 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Come on and take your best shot, 
Let me see what you've got 
Bring on your wrecking ball

Now my home was here in the meadowlands, 
Where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes 
Here where the blood is spilled, 
The arena's filled, and giants play the game 
So raise up your glasses 
And let me hear your voices call 
Come on! 
Because tonight all the dead are here, 
So bring on your wrecking ball

Bring on your wrecking ball 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Take your best shot, 
Let me see what you've got 
Bring on your wrecking ball
One, two, one two three four!

Yeah we know that come tomorrow, 
None of this will be here 
So hold tight on your anger 
Hold tight on your anger 
Hold tight to your anger, and don't fall to your fear
Now when all this steel and these stories, 
They drift away to rust 
And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust 
And your game has been decided, 
And you're burning the clock down 
And all our little victories and glories, 
Have turned into parking lots 
When your best hopes and desires, 
Are scattered through the wind 
And hard times come, hard times go 

Hard times come, hard times go 
And hard times come, hard times go 
Hard times come, hard times go 
Hard times come, hard times go 
Yeah just to come again
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
Come on and take your best shot, 
Let me see what you've got 
Bring on your wrecking ball 

Bring on your wrecking ball 
(bring on your wrecking ball) 
Bring on your wrecking ball 
(bring on your wrecking ball) 
Take your best shot, 
Let me see what you've got, 
Bring on your wrecking ball
One, two, one two three four!
