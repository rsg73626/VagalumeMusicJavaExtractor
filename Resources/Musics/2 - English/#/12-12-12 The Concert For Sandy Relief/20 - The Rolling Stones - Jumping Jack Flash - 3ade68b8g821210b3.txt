THE ROLLING STONES - JUMPING JACK FLASH

I was born in a crossfire hurricane,
 and I howled at my ma in the driving rain.
 But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas.
 But it's all right, I'm jumpin' Jack Flash
 It's a gas, gas, gas!

 I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag,
 I was schooled with a strap right across my back.
 But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas.
 But it's all right, I'm jumpin' Jack Flash
 It's a gas, gas, gas!

 I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead,
 I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled.
 I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
 I was crowned with a spike right thru my head.
 But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas.
 But it's all right, I'm jumpin' Jack Flash
 It's a gas, gas, gas!

 Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
