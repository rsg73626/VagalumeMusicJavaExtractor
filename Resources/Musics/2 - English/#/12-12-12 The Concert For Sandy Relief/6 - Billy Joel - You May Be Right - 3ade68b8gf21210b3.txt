BILLY JOEL - YOU MAY BE RIGHT

Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I've walked the Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said it only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey, but I might just be the lunatic your looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right

I remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Cuz you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you've tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
But if I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey, but I might just be the lunatic you're looking for
Too late to fight
Too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right

You may be right
I may be crazy
But I might just be the lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right

You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right...
