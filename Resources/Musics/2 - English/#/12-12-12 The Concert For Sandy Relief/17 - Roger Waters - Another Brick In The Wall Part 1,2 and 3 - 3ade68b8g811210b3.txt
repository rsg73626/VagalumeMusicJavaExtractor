ROGER WATERS - ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL PART 1,2 AND 3

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could

By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, 
Their fat and Psychopathic wives 
Would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall


All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

Just another blunder
Just another lousy call
Just another clap of thunder

And apologies ring hollow
From the guilty in Whitehall
And there's no hint of sorrow
In the whitewash on their walls
And nothing has changed

Jean Charles de Menezes
Remains
Just another brick in the wall
