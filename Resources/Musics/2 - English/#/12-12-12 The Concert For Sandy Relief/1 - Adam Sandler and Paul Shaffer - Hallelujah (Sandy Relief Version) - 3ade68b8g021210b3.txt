ADAM SANDLER AND PAUL SHAFFER - HALLELUJAH (SANDY RELIEF VERSION)

The terror of the hurricane
the unforgiving wind and rain
New York the world held it's breath 
As the storm took it to ya
But you been knocked down in the past
Taking shots they thought would last
But you always get right up shouting hallelujah

Hallelujah
Sandy screw ya
We'll get through ya
Cause were New Yorkers

Yeah New York you've dealt with crap before
Like squeegee men and tunnel whores
That restaurant delivery biking right through ya

They'll puke on your stoops every sunday morn'ing
Time Square losing all it's porn
Original Ray's Pizza closing to ya

But Hallelujah
Sandy screw ya'
We'll get through ya
Cause we're New Yorkers

Cause we believe this too shall pass
Like when Sanchez fumbled into an ass
And during the playoffs A-Rod 
Telling girls in the crowd- i want to do ya

The Mets have sucked since '86
Isiah tried to ruin the Knicks
But now Jason Kidd and the boys 
Can freaking school you

Hallelujah
Sandy screw ya'
We'll get through ya
Cause were New Yorkers

 
The bed bugs scare of 2010
The Lohans getting busted again and again
The lady who said she was a man right after she blew ya (sorry that was just me)

Trump's comb over always making us sick
The Congressman who tweeted his dick
The Mayor's ban on 32 ounce Moutain Dew

Hallelujah
Sandy screw ya
We'll freaking Kung-Fu ya
Cause were New Yorkers

And Jersey you've taken your share of hits
The Situation always showing his tits
The Turnpike exit 13 stinking like poo-ya
You've lost the Nets and now they're good
But we're still the Hudson brotherhood
Together we'll give Sandy a big fongool-ya

Hallelujah
Connecticut too ya
We'll get through ya  
Cause were New Yorkers
