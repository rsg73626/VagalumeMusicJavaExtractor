BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS

Grab your ticket and your suitcase
Thunder's rolling down the tracks
Don't know where you're goin'
Sky is turnin' black
Well darlin' if you're weary
Lay your head upon my chest
We'll take what we can carry
And we'll leave behind the rest

Big wheels rolling through fields
Where sunlight streams
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams

Well I will provide for you
Ya and I will stand by your side
You'll need a good companion darlin'
For this part of the ride
Ya leave behind your sorrows
Ya this day at last
Tomorrow they'll be sunny skies
And all this darkness past

Big wheels rolling through fields
Where sunlight streams
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams

This train
Carries saints and sinners
This train
Carries losers and winners
This train
Carries whores and gamblers
This train
Carries midnight ramblers
This train
Carries broken hearted
This train
Carries souls departed
This train
Dreams will not be thwarted
This train
Faith will be rewarded
This train
Carries fools and kings
This train
Hear the big wheels singing
This train
Bells of freedom ringing
