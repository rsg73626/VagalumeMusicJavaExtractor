ALICIA KEYS - NO ONE

I just want you close 
Where you can stay forever 

You can be sure 
That it will only get better 
You and me together 
Through the days and nights 
I don't worry 'cause 
Everything's gonna be alright 

People keep talking 
They can say what they like 
But all I know is 
Everything's gonna be alright 

No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you 

You, you 

Can get in the way of what I feel for you 

When the rain is pouring down 
And my heart is hurting 
You will always be around 
Yes, I know, for certain 

You and me together 
Through the days and nights 
I don't worry 'cause 
Everything's gonna be alright 

People keep talking 
They can say what they like 
But all I know is 
Everything's gonna be alright 

No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you 

You, you 

Can get in the way of what I feel 

I know, some people search the world 
to find something like what we have 
I know, people will try, try to divide 
something so real 
so 'till the end of time 
I'm telling you that 

No one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling 
No one, no one, no one 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you 

Oh oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh oh ooh, 
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oooh 
Oh oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh oh ooh, 
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oooh
