TERRIBLE HANDS

don't touch me
with your terrible hands
you don't know me
still your terrible hands
taint all of which
your little heart desires

you're so sold you can't see
you're so sold that you can't see
terrible hands are keeping you
from listening to me

T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E-H-A-N-D-S
terrible hands can't think for themselves

terrible hands
sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
yeah

i was fine with everything up until
gretchen got all up in my grill
superfriends with colored lips
make shitty diplomats

you're a girlfriend (no)
a punching bag
you're a puppet
in a masquerade
but funny looks on a sunny day
is all i wanna say to you except

we don't owe you shit
stay out of our business
what part of fuck off
don't you understand

terrible hands
sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
terrible hands
sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

you're so sold you can't see
you're so sold that you can't see
terrible hands are keeping you
from listening to me

T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E-H-A-N-D-S
terrible hands can't think for themselves

terrible hands
sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
terrible hands
sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
terrible hands
sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E-H-A-N-D-S
terrible hands
terrible hands
yeah!
