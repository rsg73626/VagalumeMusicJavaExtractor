RADIOACTION

after all that we've been through
i close my eyes to look at you
i do

shake my head and bite my hand
oh, all the attention that you so demand
when you shine across the land

you got that radioaction
brighter than a sunny day
i wear a lot of protection
just to keep all your sun away

incineration, baby
coming straight from the heart
why can't i win
not the love but the other thing

so ya burn down my buildings
you're so crazy when i'm with you
oh silly me
baring my ass to the moon

you got that radioaction
brighter than a sunny day
i wear a lot of protection
just to keep all your sun away

you got that radioaction
brighter than a sunny day
i wear a lot of protection
just to...

you can bust out the hammers baby
but it's thicker than the average shell
we cannot tell
a playful kiss, my private hell

you got that radioaction
brighter than a sunny day
i wear a lot of protection
just to keep all your sun away

you got that radioaction
brighter than a sunny day
i wear a lot of protection
just to keep all your sun away
