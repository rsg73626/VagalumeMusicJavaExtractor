CHROMATICALLY DECLINING ME

standing concrete form and concrete smile
small children poking me in the eyes

i'm having too much fun in bed with myself
(wooh) it hit me that...

how many good people are
deceiving me right now?
i think about it too much

america's number one statistical faux pas
(wooh, wooh)

by my volition
by my volition
by my volition
(wooh) it hit me that...

how many good people are
deceiving me right now?
i think about it like
backwards voices and bad t.v. programming
i'm drawn to life like the klan are to minority
it's something i don't want to see
chromatically declining me

standing concrete form and concrete smile
small children poking me in the eyes

it's so hard to wake up
when your mind and body aches
and your dick's in your hand
you begin to count with you fingers about

how many good people are
deceiving me right now?
i think about it like
backwards voices and bad t.v. programming
i'm drawn to life like the klan are to minority
it's something i don't want to see
chromatically declining me
