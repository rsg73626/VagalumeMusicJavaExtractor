BLISS

Happy is the man who doesn't speak aloud
Or doesn't sing I'm sorry

Fine don't give me one more chance
I won't explain the reason that is why

Happiness is bliss like ignorance
Leave me lies

God I'm glad you told me how you felt
Give me one more chance

I won't wait 'till tomorrow
But don't you know it never comes
