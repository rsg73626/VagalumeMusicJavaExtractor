I WISH THAT YOU WERE A GIRL

i wish you were a girl
a girl who is soft as silk
but silky from the inside out

don't get me wrong, i like you anyway
i'll be with you today
you can show me your way

'cause i feel green
if you know what i mean
don't be so nice to me
'cause i feel awkward

i wish you were a girl
but i'm not sorry that you're not
'cause i'm still flattered

don't get me wrong
but everything's so new
'cause i'm not scared for some reason
'cause i got naked with you

'cause i feel green
if you know what i mean
don't be so nice to me
'cause i feel awkward

'cause if you were a girl (oh)
nothing would seem to matter
('cause) if you were a girl (oh)
i wouldn't really care

i wish you were a girl
i hate what i just said
i wish you were a girl
for some reason, i don't know,
but someone told me to

'cause i feel green
if you know what i mean
don't be so nice to me
'cause i feel awkward

'cause if you were a girl (oh)
nothing would seem to matter
('cause) if you were a girl (oh)
i wouldn't really care
if you were a girl (oh)
come on over and see me
if you were a girl (ooh)

i'm sinning for another answer
i'm sinning for my right to care
i'm laughing but it's not so funny
so take me far away from here

i wish you were a girl
i wish you
i wish you were a girl
i wish you
i wish you were
