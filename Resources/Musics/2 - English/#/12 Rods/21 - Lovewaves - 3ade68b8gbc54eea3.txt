LOVEWAVES

i'll write a book when i'm old enough to
i know i've planted at least one tree
i'll have a girl when i'm old enough to
i'd love to inspire her

my gifts are stored behind my two blue eyes
i'll share this knowledge with you

i have a bed that i will share with you
receiving lovewaves

from my right
from my left
up above
down below

remember to treat yourself to ice cream
