YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME

Your secret's safe with me
Baby
If that's the way it has to be

Your secret's got me thinking
But slowly
Of past lives that hang from my wall

From my right
From my left
Up above
Down below

You can always know
Your secret's safe with me
Baby
If that's the way it has to be

I couldn't promise you the world
Baby
So why do you whisper in my ear

You got my head spinnin'
But slowly
The glorious sounds that i hear

From my right
From my left
Up above
Down below

You can always know
Your secret's safe with me
Baby
If that's the way it has to be

Can we get together
Tonight
The moon's in cancer
Such a pretty light
Can i turn to you
You can always turn to me
Sea of tranquility

I've thrown away the key
Your secret's safe with me
Baby
If that's the way it has to be
