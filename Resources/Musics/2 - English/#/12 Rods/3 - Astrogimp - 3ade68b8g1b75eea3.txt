ASTROGIMP

stuck in a rocking chair
i'm paralyzed
i'm a boy in a bubble
sterilized

and i yell in vain
you're like a broken pipe to my brain

oh girl you knock me out
baby you don't even have to touch
astrogimp, too intelligent to quit
get sucked into the sky

stencil-neck picture book
in outer space
reads between the lines
skips the pages

no one understands
so we get lost in our underpants
aaah, splash!

girl you knock me out
i wish i did the same to you
astrogimp, too intelligent to quit
get sucked into the sky

astrogimp, too intelligent to quit
get sucked into the sky

astrogimp, too intelligent to quit
get sucked into the sky
