24 HOURS AGO

2-4 hours ago
Was twice the length when i was barely
Half my age

You were mine for 24 hours at a time
But i bet you guessed by now you'd hardly satisfied

Cuz 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keepin' on

I can't
I can't get with it (wha-oh)
I can't even get arrested (wha-ah-oh)
Counting out the days
Cuz they all taste the same

The only thing i know
Is my chocolate covered loophole
And the story of a shark
That meets the rock and roll fringe

Cuz 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keepin' on

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba

You're gonna live
You're gonna die
You better make up all your minds
Are you gonna listen to your heartbeat
On a saturday night

You were mine for 24 hours at a time
Don't leave me cuz you love me
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Cuz 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keepin' on

Cuz 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keepin' on
