TELEPHONE HOLIDAY

Not gonna call you
And i'm not gonna be your friend
Won't be your lover
Never ever ever again

Pretty baby
Please don't cry
I have no reason
Just goodbye

I'm a bad bad person
And i just wanted to play
But i'm signing off gently

With my telephone holiday
Telephone holiday
No calls for you
With my telephone holiday
My telephone holiday

Like a bunny
You think i get around
Maybe so baby
You were just the first girl that i found
At the party
Which i thought was pretty cool
Little did i know
That you were still in high school

I'm a bad bad person
And i just wanted to play
But i'm signing off gently

With my telephone holiday
Telephone holiday
No calls for you
With my telephone holiday
My telephone holiday

Not gonna call you
And i'm not gonna be your friend
Won't be your lover
Never ever ever again

Pretty baby
Please don't cry
I have no reason

I'm a bad bad person
And i just wanted to play
But i'm signing off gently

With my telephone holiday
Telephone holiday
No calls for you

I'm waiting
Someone turn me on
Make it sexy
Make it last long
Cuz i'll be your sucker
That turns your tongue blue
I'll love you
But watch out for my way
And my telephone holiday

My telephone holiday
My telephone holiday
My telephone holiday
My telephone holiday (no calls for you)
My telephone holiday (no calls for you)
My telephone holiday (no calls for you)
My telephone holiday
My telephone holiday
