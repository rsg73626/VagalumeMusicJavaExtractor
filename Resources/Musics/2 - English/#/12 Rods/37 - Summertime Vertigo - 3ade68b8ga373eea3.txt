SUMMERTIME VERTIGO

i read 17 magazines
in 24 hours
deathwish daydreamer
i slip in the shower

cuz when i sit alone
touch the devil's hand
summertime vertigo
fall i can't stand

now at 26 i'm tired
my white flag's on fire
gonna burn your bad house down
burn it with a smile

cuz in the shapes of our lives
we're cornered by size
guided by choices
that keep me in at anight

summertime vertigo
summertime vertigo
whaaa-ooh
summertime vertigo
summertime vertigo
whaaa-ooh

i need to find me a lover
but they're all undercover
spies in my head
spies that want me dead

cuz when i sit alone
and touch the devil's hand
summertime vertigo
fall i can't stand

summertime vertigo
summertime vertigo
whaaa-ooh
summertime vertigo
summertime vertigo
whaaa-aaa-ooh

summertime vertigo
summertime vertigo
whaaa-ooh
summertime vertigo
summertime vertigo

i read 17 magazines
in 24 hours
