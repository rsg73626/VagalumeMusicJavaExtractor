GIRL SUN

heavy water
that falls all over me
i asked her
then i fell asleep

i don't believe i asked her
no i don't believe i did
i believe i fell asleep
tonight

stop the pilot
the pilot's flown so high
so high i'll never come back down
so i closed my eyes

i do not trust in my conscience
and i don't believe in wine
i believe you've made your point to me
your point to me

is the girl sun and her distant places
girl sun and her fickle faces
you're so bright that i closed my eyes so long
that now you're gone

i asked for heaven
then she asked me for time
so i gave her mine
yeah i gave her mine

i do not trust in science
and i don't believe in god
i believe you've made your point to me
your point to me

is the girl sun and her distant places
girl sun and her fickle faces
you're so bright that i closed my eyes so long
that now
you're a girl sun who lights my way
girl sun to whom i pray
you're so bright that i closed my eyes so long
that now, that...

ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a

the sun seems so far away
the sun stings my eyes
she my girl sun
a sting that hurt my eyes
i didn't realize that i closed my eyes so long

that now you're gone
