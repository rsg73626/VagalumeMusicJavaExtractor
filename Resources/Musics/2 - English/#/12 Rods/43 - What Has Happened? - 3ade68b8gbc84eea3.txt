WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

My ex thinks she's so tough
She flicks her cigarette before she puffs
I think she's a man when she wears adidas
She lost her libido then dumped me for a punk

Who's in a band, sounds like korn
But pretentiously aggressive
Not too impressive
For someone she brags to be an ex-junkie
What has happened to the one that i love

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?

Lady irony, thanks for the memories
Habits form like a brain stem injury
You were an angel meant to die
Who kept me on the outside

My arms didn't fail, they just disappeared
I'm an empty handed bandit with the rock career
Now i'm singing the blues like an oil spill dove
What has happened to the one that i love?

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?

I die like a dog, now the coast is clear
So you can step up to the master's chair
But just remember where i am today
Cuz i was the first to have you anyway

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?

What has happened?
What has happened?
What has happened, what has happened
What has happened to the one that i love?
