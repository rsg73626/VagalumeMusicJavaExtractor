FAKE MAGIC 8 BALL

ooh, fake magic 8 ball
ooh, what is my problem
don't cop me no attitude
i'm not in the mood

stuck between two answers (shake it up)
come on, come on, come on
i walked away angry, thought about the future
made plans with a lover, forgot about nothing
don't cop me no attitude
i'm not in the mood

ooh, i need an answer
fake magic 8 ball
ooh, i need an answer
so i don't get in trouble
ooh, i need an answer
fake magic 8 ball

haunted by a pattern
dirt in my shoe
rock in my soul, no pain at all
cuz there's a hole for my toe
i might catch a cold
but i'll bust it like i did before
don't cop me no attitude
i'm not in the mood

ooh, i need an answer
fake magic 8 ball
ooh, i need an answer
so i don't get in trouble
ooh, i need an answer
fake magic 8 ball
ooh, i need an answer
fake magic 8 ball
