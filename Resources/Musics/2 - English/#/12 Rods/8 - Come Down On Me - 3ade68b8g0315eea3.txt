COME DOWN ON ME

I'm now in shallow water
And leave me in
I used to stand and falter

Because our distance is a word away
This thing won't last another day
Come on down to see a friend
Come on down on me again

You are as sheer as the heaven's sky
But the sky's come down on me
It's not over me

As deep as I may seem
It's oh so true that me and you
Are as close as sisters, lovely and so new
