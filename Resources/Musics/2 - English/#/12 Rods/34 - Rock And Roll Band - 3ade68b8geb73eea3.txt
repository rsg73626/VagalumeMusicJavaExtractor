ROCK AND ROLL BAND

like silence
and heavy deep breathing
touch my neck
like you were teething

thought you were deaf
or just hard of hearing
somehow it shown on your face
no waiting
or deep conversating
we cut to the chase

you're counting my secrets
you're looking for lies
i'm perfectly honest
my honesty tries
to fuck like the last man
you'd ever want to have
you leave me forever
cuz I'm in a rock and roll band

one would say
my rock plan backfired
i'm a lonely boy
with rock love for hire

she wasn't deaf
in fact, she's a singer
who doesn't like what i do
no more smoking bongs
to louie armstrong's
beautiful songs

you're counting my secrets
you're looking for lies
i'm perfectly honest
my honesty tries
to fuck like the last man
you'd ever want to have
you leave me forever
cuz I'm in a
yeah i'm in a rock and roll band

(ooh ooh ah ooh ooh ah ooh ooh ah)

you're counting my secrets
you're looking for lies
i'm perfectly honest
my honesty tries
to fuck like the last man
you'd ever want to have
you leave me forever
cuz I'm in a rock and roll band

future rock band
modern rock band
space rock band
alterna-rock band
progressive rock band
confusing rock band
