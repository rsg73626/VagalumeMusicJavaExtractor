RAINMAN

Don't need a law to choke my caw
These fuckin' days aren't way too long
The mountains that you don't see here
Believe me now
Suffregence can be your friend
With a round stick bic in the medium
Don't take a bow believe me now!

Rain Sun

My days are short I live them well
I don't need you to ring my bell
Just suckle up or you'll go to hell
I'm your rainman when you pray
I hope this one will ease your pain
Turn on your light and hear me through
'Cause your face is turning black and blue!

I hope this one will ease your pain
