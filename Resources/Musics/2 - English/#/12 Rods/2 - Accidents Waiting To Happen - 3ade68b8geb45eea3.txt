ACCIDENTS WAITING TO HAPPEN

accidents waiting to happen
but we're both smarter than that
smarter than that
if i get down with you girl
will you say the things that you say to me
so i forget all the pain and the misery
that we've been through before

a good tease is like good sex
without disease without the complex
but it's easier said than done when we go
dance till the morning come
and i'm caught on the scene with the smoking gun

when the minds turn off and we're turned on
if i waste my time reaching backwards
i'm gone

accidents waiting to happen
but we're both smarter than that
smarter than that
if i get down with you girl
will you say the things that you say to me
so i forget all the pain and the misery
that we've been through before
forget all the pain and the misery

criminal ecstasy
is it you, is it me
or does this happen to everyone when the party goes
on and on and on
and i'm caught on the scene with my pants down

when the minds turn off and we're turned on
if i waste my time reaching backwards
i'm gone

accidents waiting to happen
but we're both smarter than that
smarter than that
if i get down with you girl
will you say the things that you say to me
so i forget all the pain and the misery
that we've been through before
forget all the pain and the misery

forget all the pain and the misery
that we've been through before
forget all the pain and the misery

waste my time reaching backwards
then i'm gone
