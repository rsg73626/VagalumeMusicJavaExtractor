ONE THING DOES NOT BELONG

i'll hand it to the man
who can't obey
the laws of the land
becomes a natural stowaway

jump ship for a new horizon
but does not know the ropes
all he's got is electric guitar
a little faith and hope

there's a place in the heart
that reflects in the dark
beating to galactic anarchy

one thing does not belong with the others
one thing is slightly out of place
(and when we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) so our lives won't be erased for good

earth escaper
away from home
who's so happy mining saturn's precious stones

rock out in a new dominion
rock out to the force
rock and roll energy
coming from a virgin source

there's a place in the heart
that reflects in the dark
beating to galactic anarchy

one thing does not belong with the others
one thing is slightly out of place
(and when we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) our lives won't be erased for good

one thing does not belong with the others
one thing is slightly out of place
(and when we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) so our lives won't be erased for good

one thing does not belong with the others
one thing is slightly out of place
(and when we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) our lives won't be erased
(we're gone) our lives won't be erased for good
