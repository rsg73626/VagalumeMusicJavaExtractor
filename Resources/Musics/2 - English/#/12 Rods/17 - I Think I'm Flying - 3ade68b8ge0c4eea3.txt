I THINK I'M FLYING

mother, father
i'm using drugs
i try to sober
but i cannot get enough

they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying
they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying

mother, father
i'm losing blood
i try to keep it
but i think i'm giving up

they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying
they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying

mother, father
i'm using drugs
i try to sober
but i think i'm giving up

they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying
they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying

they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying
they're the best of the best
they keep my tired mind at rest
i think i'm flying
