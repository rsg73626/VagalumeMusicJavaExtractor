SPLIT PERSONALITY

tip- tip- tip- tippy-toe around
never getting with the brand new sound
the almighty one
and the unforgiving zero

you should see a doctor about your voice
and it's codes of choice

my fist, the trappings and the door
for those elementally poor
hanging from a limb
that's 'cause you never learned how to swim (yea!)

can't give you the info
i can't give you the time
can't clot your blood from behind

unified by my split personality
double strength, super size
unified by my split personality
you're a baby blinded by surprise

you were given time to waste
but were you chewing gum or chewing paste
because it's easy to swallow, but hard to digest
like branding a 666 on your chest (whoa)

'cause you're the button, i'm the pusher
yea!

unified by my split personality
double strength, super size
unified by my split personality
you're a baby blinded by surprise
surprise!

follow me
follow me
if you want to, you will see
you will see
if you're ready

can't give you the info
i can't give you the time
can't clot your blood from behind

unified by my split personality
double strength, super size
unified by my split personality
you're a baby blinded by surprise

unified by my split personality
double strength, super size
unified by my split personality
you're a baby blinded by surprise

surpri-i-i-i-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohyeohyeah!
