THE STUPIDEST BOY

I know you when I'm sleeping
I know things deep inside of me

The excitement that I swallow
I swallow things that I can't see

I know you're right behind me
But I'm too dumb to turn around

I wake with my left arm numb
Am I the stupidest boy in town
(the stupidest boy in town)

Can you see my mouth open wide
Lopsided and confused

The dead weight of my left arm
And already sold that you will refuse

Substance dream mechanical failure
My little lost boy trying to sound

I wake with my left arm numb
Am I the stupidest boy in town

Pain is good if I had understood
Stuck with weight that's hard to hide
Numbness disappears when you are near
Nicky, take me for a ride

Your daddy is smiling at me
White horses flowing through his veins

Impossible eyes, forgotten future
And enough angst-ridden guilt to go insane

A walk together, a walk that hurt
A road I didn't know and soon forgot

I wake with my left arm numb
He's not with you, will you be with me

Pain is good if I had understood
Stuck with weight that's hard to hide
Numbness disappears when you are near
Nicky, take me for a ride

Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
Nicky you touched me
