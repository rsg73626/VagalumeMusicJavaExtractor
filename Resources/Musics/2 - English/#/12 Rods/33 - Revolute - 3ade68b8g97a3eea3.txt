REVOLUTE

we've got our peace of mind

so revolute today
i'd say anything to you
to steal your best feeling
feeling sensible tonight
funny you're still growing
and knowing i'm all right

so revolute today
i'd say anything to you
who needs to know about rejection
when all you've ever done is fight
this energy that's so new
i want to name it after you

100 ways i think about
100 ways i care for
good dreams i share with you
brings luck for two
good dreams i share with you
justify everything we do

so revolute today
i'd say anything to you
i could have sworn you said
it was all about killing time
we both knew it was time to wait the wait is killing me

the daily fear that keeps me
going, pushing, scraping
you know i know i slip my tongue in your...
you needn't remind me

consider points you've made
of premature philosophy
farce comes first
nothing's worse than a finger pointed

close your eyes
not too tight
listen
and remember

consider points you've made
about my introversion
it's my illusion
to be what i am
