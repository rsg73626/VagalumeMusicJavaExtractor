THE TIME IS RIGHT (TO BE WRONG)

When you're bored
Go steal a bike or two
Inhale some gas or glue
Freak out your parents
When your lips turn blue

Noone will ever know
If you sell all the things you stole
Skip class and smoke a bowl
Or switch your gender role
Cuz don't you know

The time is right (right)
To be wrong
The time is right (right)
To be wrong
Feels so good
Kinda like it never should
The time is right (right)
To be wrong

Kick somebody's ass
Then run away real fast
Plunge through a pane of glass
Rip off your braces
Saw off your plaster cast

Cuz you're never too young
To make a booty call
Or tag a sign or a wall
Or even make your enemies
Fall, fall, fall

The time is right (right)
To be wrong
The time is right (right)
To be wrong
Feels so good
Kinda like it never should
The time is right (right)
To be wrong

Defy the weather
Stay young forever
Don't you know you're never gonna die
You know you're never gonna die
Don't you know you're never gonna die

So hack into a government mainframe
And launch a bomb
Always be where you don't belong
Go make yourself a drink
And make it strong

The time is right (right)
To be wrong
The time is right (right)
To be wrong
Feels so good
Kinda like it never should
The time is right (right)
To be wrong

The time is right (right)
To be wrong
The time is right (right)
To be wrong
Feels so good
Kinda like it never should
The time is right (right)
To be wrong

The time is right (right)
To be wrong
The time is right (right)
To be wrong
Feels so good
Kinda like it never should
The time is right (right)
To be wrong
