MARIONETTE

a disposable playtoy
and you know how to move me
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
hanging from threads i can't see
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
you cut my strings
and we'll see what freedom brings
am i a casualty when i'm away from you

fucked up but with nowhere to go
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
i'm slack from my head to my toe
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
a quick goodbye
doesn't give me time to cry
i'm just a slumping doll with nothing else to do

a black box you're calling my home
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
the ken doll won't leave me alone
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
he cut me down to size
and it opened up my eyes
i gotta take the power back away from you

don't wanna be a marionette
not made to be a marionette
don't wanna be a puppeteer's pet
but i'm a marionette cuz i'm in love with you

gonna wish upon a star
tell me who the hell i are
(i'm a marionette like you)

shake that wooden cross
and remind me that you are the boss
so i'll do a little dance designed by you

fucked up but with nowhere to go
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
i'm slack from my head to my toe
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
a quick goodbye
doesn't give me time to cry
i'm just a slumping doll with nothing else to do

a black box you're calling my home
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
the bitch dolls won't leave me alone
(i'm a marionette, i'm a marionette)
they cut me down to size
and it opened up my eyes
i gotta take the power back away from you
