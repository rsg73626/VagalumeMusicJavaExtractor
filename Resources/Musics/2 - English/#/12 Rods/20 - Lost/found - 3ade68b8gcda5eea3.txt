LOST/FOUND

the way the wind blows
the way like mothers know
the way we all go
but i don't know

imagine falling down a staircase
there's no turning back again

when i'm lost
will i be found

my life's a rigged test
i try to do my best
but i'm not always doing my best
i could use some assistance

cuz everybody's doing something
if they wanted to or not

i'm lost
will i be found
when i'm lost
will i be found
when i'm lost
will i be found
when i'm lost
