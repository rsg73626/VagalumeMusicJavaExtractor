YOU GOTTA GO

I warned you
I even told you twice
Pussy-footin' around me
Got you naked and cold
And now you're payin' the price (ha)

Like candy
You're not a friend or foe
I've had it up to here, dear
Make me give you the slip and now you've got to

Go

Please go

You've got ta got ta go
Please go

Please go

You've got ta got ta go
Yeah go go go

I warned you
As if you didn't care
How can you ask for justice
How can you ask it's never there (ha)

I'm sorry
But what you did was low
I've had it up to here, dear
Make me give you the slip and now you've got to

Go

Please go

You've got ta got ta go
