RED

write a note to tell me how you feel
'cause i'm both your friend and foe so don't
buy, sell, or trade anything from me

i know you feel as good as i feel
too bad it wasn't yesterday
'cause we'd feel twice as good right now

i'm like your pistol in your hand
undress me now stay while you can
seduction can be oh so nice
i'm not as sick as you might think
'cause your thing has that awful stink
of that shit you use
i'm not the only one who

the only one who knows
the only one who knows
the only one

take these hands and run along with me
doing this i know would set us free
only if you weren't such a fucking tease
somehow you'd always drag me to my knees
this disease i call it abstinence

i'm like your pistol in your hand
undress me now stay while you can
seduction can be oh so nice
i'm not as sick as you might think
'cause your thing has that awful stink
of that shit you use
i'm not the only one who

the only one who knows
the only one who knows
the only one
