GLAD THAT IT'S OVER

Today has sucked
But I wont let it get me down
Get my chin up off of the ground
Somebody I lost
Somebody else found

We already turned the tables
But she's still looking so willing and able
But I better not
Cuz I might get shot
Better look away

I'm so glad that it's over
Glad that it's over
I'm so glad
That it's over
The day was bad
But now it's over
I'm so glad
Yeah Yeah Yeah

It's been a long day
I just want to go to bed
Let dreams take over my head
I think I'm dying
I think I'm dead

I'm gonna pick out my Sunday dolphins
And run a sail boat accross the ocean
Caught by the cops
And I think this one is working
Oh yeah

I'm so glad that it's over
Glad that it's over
I'm so glad
That it's over
The day was bad
But now it's over
I'm so glad
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'm so glad that it's over
Glad that it's over
I'm so glad
That it's over
The day was bad
But now it's over
I'm so glad
Yeah
I'm so glad that it's over
Glad that it's over
I'm so glad
That it's over
The day was bad
But now it's over
I'm so glad
Yeah Yeah Yeah
