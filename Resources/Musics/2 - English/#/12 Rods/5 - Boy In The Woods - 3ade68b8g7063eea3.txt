BOY IN THE WOODS

boy in the woods
guns, wine and hoods
hang the has been that never was
lost in his costume
a legend in his own mind
he's a legend in his own mind

he's for real but others think he's fake
not smart enough to see his own fate
apollo slapped him in the face

sold on the sands of morocco
english poacher
sold your soul to a soldier

there are things that he doesn't think about
like a rut is a grave with the ends knocked out
apollo no!

aaaah ah-ahh
oo-ah-ah-ah
aaaa-ah
ah-ah-ah

he's for real but others think he's fake
not smart enough to see his own fate
apollo slapped him in the face

we all laugh as his life falls apart
all he wants is to win your heart
apollo knew this from the start
