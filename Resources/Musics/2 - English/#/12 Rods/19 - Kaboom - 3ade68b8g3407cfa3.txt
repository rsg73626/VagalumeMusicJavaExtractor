KABOOM

sex!
it's a regular practice
don't make it feel like a roundabout process
and don't think that it's love

girl, if you think that it's phony
slick like rick and counterfeit money
don't worry
cuz it's better than love

but somehow you got me needing to be with you
make me say it's true
now i'm stepping on a mine
uh oh
kaboom!

so long reality
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
goodbye friends and family
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
yeah, let's hope i come back
soon

sex!
i begin to wonder
how it's been known to put people six feet under
the murder
of being in love

damn, this makes me nervous
i can't blame it on a bad dating service
the burden
of being in love

but somehow you got me needing to be with you
make me say it's true
now i'm stepping on a mine
uh oh
kaboom!

so long reality
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
goodbye friends and family
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
so long reality
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
goodbye friends and family
let's hope i come back
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
yeah, let's hope i come back

i'm coming home
i'm coming home
yeah, i'm coming home today

cuz after everything that's happened
we were never meant to be
free, but in the place
that wipes the smile off my face
and when i bow my head to say grace
i wonder where are you?
yeah, where are you?

let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
let's hope i come back soon
yeah, let's hope i come back

i'm coming home
yeah, i coming home
mama, i'm coming home today
