TELL A LIE

Hello I'm fine but jealous again
I think, for you
I didn't mean to scare you too

Can you see the portrait that you really want to be
I can't see you
I'll just open up my eyes for me and you

Don't pray for me I'll get out soon
It will be soon
I know it's right to tell you, too

Look up the walls have eyes
The ones you'd never see
Open your mind to set me free

My love
With those dark moon eyes
I cannot tell a lie
