REPEAT

i used to be
i lived inside you
however measured or far away
so gray today and black tomorrow
you had your fun
just give me space and time
you'll never have to pay

give me time
just give me some wine
and if you sing me a rhyme
then i'll be just fine

who is this man here
let's all just shout his name
if i could i'd just
wash it all away
and have no pain

give me time (give me time)
just give me some wine
and if you sing me a rhyme
then i'll be just fine
give me time (give me time)
just give me some wine
and if you sing me a rhyme
then i'll be just fine

girl i like what you wear
hurt me cuz i don't care
fine i don't care that you don't share
cuz i don't care

give me time (give me time)
just give me some wine
and if you sing me a rhyme
then i'll be just fine
give me time (give me time)
just give me some wine
and if you sing me a rhyme
then i'll be just fine
