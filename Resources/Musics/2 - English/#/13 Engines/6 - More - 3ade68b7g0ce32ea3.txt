MORE

I can feel something inside
And it wants to get out
Growing every day in a different way
I can’t put it in words
It could be now or maybe later
It can read my mind

I’ve pretended not to notice
What’s been happening inside
But as the days go drifting buy
I can deny it no more
Ihear a voice, getting louder
It calls my name
And it wants more

Well, once you’ve learned, once and for all
This is nothing new
The rest is easy, I’m sure that you’ll see
It belongs to you
It may be silent or may be too loud
But it’s hear to stay
And it wants more
