THE ESTRANGEMENT

(John Critchley)

Time is so hard to find when your occupied
Lost in my own world, I didn't notice what's happening
Last time that I saw you I said things
That I didn't mean and now I wish I could take them back
But that was long ago and now it's today
And it's much too late
Though God knows I would change the past if I could

Weather is changing again, animals are moving in new directions
When you coming home, it's been too long
Don't be such a stranger, I'd love to see you soon
Do you remember me, well I remember you
Won't you come to me

I want to see you so bad
I want to be with you right now
