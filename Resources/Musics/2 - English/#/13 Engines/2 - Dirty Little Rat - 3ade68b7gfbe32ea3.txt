DIRTY LITTLE RAT

(John Critchley)

Dirty little rat, never could get it straight
The man upstairs says he doesn't care
If you live 'til daylight
Dirty little rat
Get your coat, get your hat
We're gonna take a ride tonight

My sweet baby boy, born under circumstance
I'm gonna give you all I got to give you a chance
Sweet baby boy
You're going to understand
Someday you'll be a man

Something inside snapped
I stil ldon't understand
The deal went down, I looked around
I was left holding the bag
Something inside cracked
The deal went down, I looked around
And now here I am
