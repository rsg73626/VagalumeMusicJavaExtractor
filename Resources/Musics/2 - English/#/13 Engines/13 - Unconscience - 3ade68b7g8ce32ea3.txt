UNCONSCIENCE

Sometimes I'm dirty, sometimes I'm clean
Sometime I talk in circles so I don't know what I mean
Although I am uncertain, one thing seems clear
I don't know very much, but I'm still glad to be here

Because I've got a conscience and he's got the same name
When it goes badly he gets the blame
When it goes good I get the acclaim
When I get hit he feels the pain

Weren't you before me or were in the past
You'll have to excuse me, I didn't think that this was going to last
Well, I heard the road that spirals down
Has been paved with the best intentions that can be found

I've got a conscience and he's got a name
When it goes badly he gets the blame
When it goes good I get the acclaim
When I get hit he feels the pain
