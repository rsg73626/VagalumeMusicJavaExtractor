LIFT YOU UP

(John Critchley)

Your mind is all cluttered now
But you drag yourself along somehow
Through dark dreams of that visit you in the night
Obscure fragments with broad daylight
Watch me now

What did you say about what I've done
What do you want to know, why or how come?
Haven't you learned yet that it never ends
Back and forth and around, here it comes again

CHORUS
Watch me now
And I'll lift you up if I can
Watch me now

You're eyes are wild and your nerves exposed
But you haven't lost anything, not by a mile, not yet
Can yo uremember the good times
They can be back soon, better than before

CHORUS
