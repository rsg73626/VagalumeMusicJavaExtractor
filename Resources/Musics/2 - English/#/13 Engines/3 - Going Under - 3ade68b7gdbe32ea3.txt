GOING UNDER

I hear the door slam shut, so I know that you're home
You've been out all night, I've been here alone
And I've been wondering if you're the same person I knew
The bright lights that shine in your eyes, they make me blind

I hear a footstep on the stairs so I know that you're near
You've returned from pursuing your nocturnal career
And I don't ask where you've been, with who, or if they're your friend
'Cause I don't really want to know right now, I don't know when I will again

CHORUS
Going under, drifting down, going under
And I know you've still got a ways to go down before
We can rise back up into the light
We're going under, drifting down...

I hear you coughing in the hall so I know you're all right
It will be morning soon, through the gloom I see daylight
But in this room right now I am alone, I am unsure
I don't know what you feel anymore and it scares me so

CHORUS
