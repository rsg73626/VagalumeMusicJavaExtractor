SMOKE AND ASHES

Tick-tock went the watch on your wrist
Telling you softly of the minutes you've missed
Kneeling down with your head in the bowl
Telling yourself, there should never be days like this

Just when you thought that you had it down
You woke up dreaming of cocaine and clowns
Everybody knew that you sang the blues
No one could guess that you would sing them like this

CHORUS
Smoke and ashes
Smoke and ashes
A comet burns and then it crashes
Smoke and ashes

You spilled the beans on Friday night
Now Monday's here and there's no one in sight
But, hey, that's the price that you've got to pay
For letting yourself get your own way

CHORUS
