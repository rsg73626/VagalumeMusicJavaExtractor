WHAT IF WE DON'T GET WHAT WE WANT

(Jim Hughes)

We were sitting at the head of a car
And her lips were dry and parched
And we turned to each other
We were listening to "Suspicious Minds"

CHORUS
And we're cracking codes and combinations
And we're thinking
What if we don't get what we want

SWell, you kick away your golden shoes
Counting what you can afford to lose
And I can't treat you casually
We are not fond of misery

CHORUS

On the frozen lake of memory
You were asking me about my dream
And we're turning to each other
And we are so primitive

CHORUS
