THE GOLDEN AGE

So the Golden Age passed away to silver
But that was long ago
There were swimming holes and the Vaudeville
They gave way to this

Bronze turned itself slowly into iron
And here we are today
If what you say has a grain of truth
The age of rust is soon

Please, it's not a thing just to bring you down
It's just a passing phase
But who'll believe your piano played itself
A long forgotten air

CHORUS
The Golden Age, it'll never fade away
Today just don't seem the same
The Golden Age, it'll never fade away
If you were there

There will always be someone telling you
That these are wicked times
Rainy days come down just to make you think
Of all the shades of grey
No one knew that you liked to paint
Until they cleaned your room

CHORUS
