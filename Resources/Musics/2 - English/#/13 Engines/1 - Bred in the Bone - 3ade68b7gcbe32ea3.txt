BRED IN THE BONE

Didn't you want to place
Didn't you want to show
No you've got a disease
And it's laid you low
(Laid you low)

If you had it in you
What you had before
You could pick yourself up
Up off of the floor
(Laid you low)

What's come over you
What could it be
Does it have a name
An identity
(Laid you low)

Do you need a doctor
The head of surgery
Do you want a dealer
Who'd give you shit for free
(Laid you low)

CHORUS
What's bred in the bone
Has laid you low
