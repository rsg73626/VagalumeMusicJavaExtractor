A.T.H.F

Master Shake's a poser
Meatwad's dumb as hell
Frylock thinks he's so damn smart
But they all go in my mouth

It's just to long his real last name
They call him Carlton Smith
All these friends are mine
Come late Sunday night it is bliss

Can I swim in your pool
Can I swim in your piss poor pool
Can I swim in your pool
Can I swim in your up above ground pool
Well it's Sunday night

Those power hungry space people 
From Pluto and the moon
Take fancy to your Jersey home 
But they never stay too long

When you eat at burger trench
The buns is in your mind
That's why when at burger trench
It's only 3.99

Can I swim in your pool
Can I swim in your piss poor pool
Can I swim in your pool
Can I swim in your up above ground pool
Well it's Sunday night

And we're alright
It's sunday night
And we're alright
Begin the fight

(don't eat the broodwich,
dude its cool, his dad owns a dealership.
this game is so boring
I had to put up all these wind chimes 
before I could even fight)
