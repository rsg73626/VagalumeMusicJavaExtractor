ZOMBIES

Jeauly got the hunger from her second cousins dad
Who was visiting from south Lemoyne on downtown Princes Ave.
She gave it to her best friend john who got it pretty bad
Now the neighborhood's infested things are getting out of hand


Well Toby bit Melissa who killed Tony with her teeth
And Tony bit Anita that lived across the street
Anitas turning greener than a water dwelling toad
Whos now chasing my complexion down our old deserted road

The undead are walking the streets
Searching for some brains and flesh to eat
Imagine a life of despair
These simple creatures cant even think or hear


The undead are walking the streets
With missing limbs and no pulsing heart beats
Imagine a life of despair
These simple creatures cant even think or hear


These people I used to call friends
Everyone I used to know is dead
These people I used to call friends
Everyone I used to know is dead

The government is at a loss for what is being spread
With no chance of a cure they just quarantine instead
The people on the news are giving up and going home
Now running out of food and our survival is unknown

The undead are walking the streets
With missing limbs and no pulsing heart beats
Imagine a life of despair
Just stick together and shoot them in the head
Just stick together and shoot them in the head
