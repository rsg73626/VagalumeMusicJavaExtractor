CONVERSATIONS

Conversations start again
This illusion's taking me nowhere
Talking to myself again
Wasting my time taking me nowhere

Im stuck inside my brain
It all remains the same
Stuck inside my brain
Ive gone insane

Looking to the past
Its moving away fast
Kicking my own ass
Ive gone insane

Repeating what I should have said
Repeating what I could have said Im there 
Is this the dawning of again
Is this the story that I can't share

Im stuck inside my brain
It all remains the same
Stuck inside my brain
Ive gone insane

Looking to the past
Its moving away fast
Kicking my own ass
Ive gone insane

Conversations in my head
Im having
Conversations in my head
Im going nowhere
