BORED, DRUNK, AND HORNY

Everyday is a long day
It starts at 8 and it doesn't end till ten
I go to bed just to wake again
Another day and it doesn't seem to end

Friday's here it's a cheer and want some beer
Hoping to forget the week and fail out
School is done time to run and I want some fun
Nothing else to do so I'll see what's at the bar

Oh no here we go
Spent my money at the show
Saw one but got none
Feeling empty is no fun
The bar's closed now it's two
And I don't know what to do
So here we are on another fucking weekend
It's just another fucking weekend
So here we go

Every weekend has a second chance
Feeling low cause I know it won't matter
Hoping now that tonite's the night
Even though it's hard to carry out

Saturday what a day well it's time go
Gotta shake off from the beer I had last night last night
I'm still ill and spread out but without a doubt
Nothing else to do so I'll head out to the bar

Oh no here we go
Spent my money at the show
Saw one but got none
Feeling empty is no fun
The bar's closed now it's two
And I don't know what to do
So here we are on another fucking weekend
It's just another fucking weekend

I sit inside my home alone 
I got not no friends i got no phone
And so i now begin again another fucking weekend yeah
So here we are

Well I wake up and spill my gut
MY spinning head has got me feeling down
Satisfaction I missed again
Sunday's come and my money has all gone

Next weekend not again now my lesson's learned
Gonna find a time that is meaningfull to me
But you'll see it's not me and I'm wrong again
I know I'm quite disturbed but guess where I will be

Oh no here we go
Spent my money at the show
Saw one but got none
Feeling empty is no fun
The bar's closed now it's two
And I don't know what to do
So here we are on another fucking weekend
It's just another fucking weekend
Let's get drunk
