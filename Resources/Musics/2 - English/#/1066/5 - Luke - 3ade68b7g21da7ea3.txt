LUKE

My best friend walks around
Seeing vaginas everywhere
He sees them in the trees
And in the clouds up in the air

He ran behind the bushes
Cause he even found one there
He cant wait till he gets home
There's one next to his chair

Vaginas on the brain
Vaginas on the brain
My best friend
Has vaginas on the brain

We sat down to eat
And he ordered a grilled cheese
He didn't hesitate to show us
What it really means

Everytime we turn around
He found another scene
He found one in his lox and bagel
And his magazine

Vaginas on the brain
Vaginas on the brain
My best friend
Has vaginas on the brain

My best friend walks around
With vaginas on the brain
He points them out all day
And its driving me insane

He even saw one in the road
Just the other day
It's clear that he is sex deprived
It's clear that he's not gay

Vaginas on the brain
Vaginas on the brain
My best friend
Has vaginas on the brain
