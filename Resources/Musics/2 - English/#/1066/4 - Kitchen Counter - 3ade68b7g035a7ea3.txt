KITCHEN COUNTER

Go upstairs find some food
Come downstairs then i splooge
These are happy days of mine
The kind you'd like to find

I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I hope things will try to work out

Clearly take my time
We have never been satisfied
Clearly stear me blind
We will never be satisfied

9 to 5 5 alive
5 to 9 9 is dead
Drain the pool whats the use
Eat a stool the lines are dead
Ask your friends to be kind
Ask the teacher when does it end
So pack your bags and your suitecase
Theres no more time you lost again

Clearly take my time
We have never been satisfied
Clearly stear me blind
We will never be satisfied

So now its the end of the day
Where your friends are untrue
And their letters are gay
Well i've got nothing to do
In a town thats shut down
Cause the heat when away

All the colours in the rainbow aren't enough for me
I want them all radio infrared and MTV
I've tried this one last time
My floor's a waste of time
So stop this stalling we're back to being boring

Clearly take my time (Take what was mine
We have never been satisfied what was mine
Clearly stear me blind what was mine
We will never be satisfied what was )

I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I hope things will try to work out
I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
