SOCIAL

Ive got no social ethics
I lack the common sense
I learned no social knowledge
Ive lost all confidence

Im pulling out my hair 
From inside of my skull
Its just the smallest little incidence
That keeps me on a roll

This happens every time we meet
This happens every time we meet
Im gonna

Drink and drink and drink until I cant feel my feelings
Im gonna drink and drink and drink until I cant hear myself think 
Ive said it said it said it right I said Im loosing all my lunch
Im just social animal who's only social when he's drunk

This happens every time we meet
This happens every time we meet
It happens


My palms are over sweating
My arms are shaking bad
My pulse is well increasing
My gums are drying out

I've got no dictionary
About the social rules
I've got no set of standards
Im just a social fool

New situation
More connotations
More contradictions
All of it bad

No intuition
No intermission
No set of actions
Once again bad

Ive got no social ethics
I lack the common sense
I learned no social knowledge
Ive lost all confidence

Im pulling out my hair 
From inside of my skull
Its just the smallest little incidence
That keeps me on a roll

This happens every time we meet
This happens every time we meet
Im gonna

Drink and drink and drink until I cant feel my feelings
Im gonna drink and drink and drink until I cant hear myself think 
Ive said it said it said it right I said Im loosing all my lunch
Im just social animal who's only social when he's drunk

This happens every time we meet
This happens every time we meet
It happens
