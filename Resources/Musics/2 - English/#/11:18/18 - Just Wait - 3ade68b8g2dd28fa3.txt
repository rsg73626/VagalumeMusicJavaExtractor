JUST WAIT

Sometimes in dreams
you seem so far away
but then there you are
smiling back like any other day

This could be crazy
but hey let's take a chance
what is there to lose
besides our hopes and the last dance

(1st) You just gotta let it come to you
hold it all in
wait till that precious moment
where it means more in the end

(2nd) Just wait
it will all come in time
Just wait
hold it all inside
Just wait
for what we feel right now
will prove to be great so
Just wait
till I can how you what I mean

You can't plan it out
just be yourself
cause you know who you are
and it's better than everyone else

You can't tell me this ain't real
cause all i'm feeling is true
it isn't falling together now
but maybe soon

(1st)
(2nd)
