NAP

Stay...
here with me
tonight is all we need
today is just a day, is a just a day

Fall...
all alone
don't cry I'll be there waiting
to stay, just to stay, just to stay

Sleep, sleep, sleep keep sleeping
they could never hurt you here
Sleep, sleep, sleep keep sleeping
and know I would never let them steal us

Wake...
don't let go
the sun is climbing up soon
our fate, break the time, and it won't rise
