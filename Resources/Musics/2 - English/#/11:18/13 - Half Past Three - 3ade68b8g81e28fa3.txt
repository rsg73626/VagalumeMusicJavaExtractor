HALF PAST THREE

Why Can't you ever hear me, hate me
It's half past three
I love you whisper
You close your eyes to see, me

But it's all over now
The pain is gonna stop
The hurt is gonna leave
Until you don't know what you got,
At least that's what I tell myself
To get through today
But what tomorrow brings
Will leave me lost and cold again

(Chorus)

{My problem starts with you
It's what you put me through
You see I hate myself for you
For what you always put me through

I'd live this life again for you
So what else is new
I'd never love you the next time, you know how it starts
If this wasn't the last step, take me down at 3 am}

Every time I think of you it hurts to know you're right
But then I laugh to think how it could have been
If I played by your rules
And wondered all through school

(Chorus)

{My problem starts with you
It's what you put me through
You see I hate myself for you
For what you always put me through

I'd live this life again for you
So what else is new
I'd never love you the next time, you know how it starts
If this wasn't the last step, take me down at 3 am
