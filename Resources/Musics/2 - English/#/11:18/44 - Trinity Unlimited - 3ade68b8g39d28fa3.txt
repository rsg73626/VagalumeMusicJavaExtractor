TRINITY UNLIMITED

Did you wake up today?
with all the nights of unfulfilled past fantasies
For-get-me-nots never left by anyone
Just gaze
up at the light
and then you'll say
I need some love
it never fades
today

I'm on my knees
waiting for the sign that it's ok to scream
I never knew how good it was to be with you
stop
things will happen
I can show you
I can show you
ecstasy

Trinity (3x)
Trinity will let you see

Sneak out
and see me now
you will know now
that with me
bad is the best thing you can be

Fly away
and get the hell out of here
they gave up
we're to strong for them
so there's nothing there to stop us anymore
hello goodbye
nothing but eye to eye
rumors of the hurt and lies

Giving it up
is not what makes me feel to free
I'll never ever
never ever
never ever
never ever
no.........

Trinity (3x)
Trinity will let you see
just you and me

Goodnight I'm tired
I'm tired goodnight
Goodnight I'm tired
I'm tired goodnight
My heart can't stop
It's racing all night
Goodnight I'm tired
I'm tired goodnight

Goodnight I'm sorry
I'm sorry goodnight
Goodnight I'm sorry
I'm sorry goodnight
I'm trying, I'm feeling you
although it's not right
Goodnight I'm sorry
I'm sorry goodnight

Goodnight I love you
I love you goodnight
nothing tells this feeling
this feeling inside
together is better
you make me feel alive
together, nothing's better
shhh turn out the lights
Goodnight I love you
I love you goodnight
