UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT

Running into doors, unlocked memories
covered by the night
With no light left to see or wasted life to be
When it's over it's over, it's not and you care, the same
things not said to you. I fear, don't blame
things you never heard before, never said but always meant
Every word, Every night. Every word, Every night

(Chorus)
Spirits around us fly
smoke from the fire calling us
to be nothing more than we were never before
Unlocking the secrets of the summer night

If we ran fast enough, would we beat destiny
I can see you now, on the beach with the sun
I can see you now, in the water making
choices made but never done
when you smile back at summer's love
and cry......and cry...... and cry......
The tears are showing and days are wasted
not unknowing but always tasted

(Chorus)

We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
Dreams are real - ending now
Softly speaking
no sound
