YOUR BACK POCKET

The calendar is finished
subtract one month then add one to it
and watch our new beginnings
one month away
with sixteen candles floating
If you'll just stay and shut them out
you will finally know all you want
and again know me

(chorus)
Well they don't know you like I do
Let them say what they want
you know the truth and what's best for you
Without you this song means nothing
Without you this song is lost
Just hope one day these words will make it
from loneliness to your back pocket

All along knew I had what I couldn't go without
All along knew I had what I couldn't go without
I'll follow one page of worsts with your best yet
I'll follow one page of worsts and make your best yet
All along knew I had what I couldn't live without

(chorus)
Well they don't know you like I do
Let them say what they want
you know the truth and what's best for you
Without you this song means nothing
Without you I am lost
Just hope one day these words will make it
from loneliness to your back pocket

And from notebooks to sneak-out nights
dreams of freedom week in your back pocket
