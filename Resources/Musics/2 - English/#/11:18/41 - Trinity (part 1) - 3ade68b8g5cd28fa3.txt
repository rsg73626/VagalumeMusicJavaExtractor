TRINITY (PART 1)

Did you wake up today?
with all the nights of unfulfilled past fantasies
For-get-me-nots never left by anyone
Just gaze
up at the light
and then you'll say
I need some love
it never fades
today

I'm on my knees
waiting for the sign that it's ok to scream
I never knew how good it was to be with you
stop
things will happen
I can show you
I can show you
ecstasy
