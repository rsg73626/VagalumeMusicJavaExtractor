PHANTOM REVERIES

Staring...
At the ceiling...
You said, "Just believe"...
Fuck this melancholy
(BRIDGE)
The opposite of me is you,
The opposite of this is true.
Asked if I care,
and I'll prove my worth to you.
(CHORUS)
When it's dark, you'll be there.
Dreamin' this dream, for me to see
I'm begging' you please, just wait a little more
don't give up on me...
(SOLO)
Sleep on this, cause I know it's late
but this could never wait.
No one's to blame, but the time will come.
When the clock will strike our fate.
(CHORUS)
When it's dark, you'll be there.
Dreamin' this dream, for me to see
I'm begging' you please, just wait a little more
don't give up on me...
