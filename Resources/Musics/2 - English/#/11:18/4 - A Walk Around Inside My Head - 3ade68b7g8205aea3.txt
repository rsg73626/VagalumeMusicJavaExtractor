A WALK AROUND INSIDE MY HEAD

Take a day 
and walk around inside my head 
but you can stay 
as long as you want 
until you feel pressured to say 
whichever this and that's will fail without no play 

If you want it 
you can have it 
pressures there 
just go away 
I really want you 
but I can't have you 
straighten your life out 
do what you wanna 
just go away 
Everyday 
just go away 

Clock strikes 9 
but upside down it's 6 
and I hate time 
cause when it's 6 it's 9 and this wasted trip 
down the way 
all these months of silence, silence 
Can't you stay? 
because it's never enough, 
it's never enough today 

Stare at the sun 
blinding your eyes 
feeling, this feeling 
this dying inside (4x)
