THURSDAY WAS YOUR FAVORITE DAY

Do you know, where everyone will go
if tomorrow always comes so slow
Look at me, look deep into my eyes
knowing everything is just alright
Things I like, things you do to me
make you know fine is the way they'll always be

Because, I just say...
Hey, do you want things to be this way?
Want me to go? Why can't I stay?
It was April but now it's May...
and Thursday was your favorite day...

Can you remember talkin' on the phone
everything about you feels like home
Wondering what to say next
cause I'll meet you on the steps
and see your pretty face
waiting in our special place

I just say...
Hey, do you want things to be this way?
Want me to go? Why can't I stay?
It was April but now it's May...
and Thursday was your favorite day...
your favorite day...
