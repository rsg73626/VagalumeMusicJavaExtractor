DON'T CRY

Hard enough to block out the sun
everything is not as it seems
It's different now...

Back then
your killers came with smiles
and when
you reach up there and fly
you see the wasted time
you see them in your mind
you know it's all a lie
you know it's all a lie

(chorus)
and when this table's taken
is when you heart is breakin'
then all your feeling turns to tears
and you cry
don't you cry, you cry
they know you cry

Break down
everything hurts (everything hurts)
Bust out
everything hurts (everything hurts)
Get loud
everything hurts (don't let it hurt)

(chorus)

Don't cry...
