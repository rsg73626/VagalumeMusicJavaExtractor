OCTOBER SKIES

Oh yea ya know it's true
it started out with you
at first we couldn't show
eachother what we know
All these things we see
so special, they could be

(Chorus)
So paint your signs up on my walls
walking lonely down your halls
dim lights fade
but things will be just fine
'cause the sun sets in your eyes
underneath these October skies

Lonely stares up at the moon
and you know what's killing me
your lips, your eyes
oh yea I need you soon

(Chorus)

Waiting for this to be
while I make this one a memory
as I push down the gas
and I'm goin' real fast
it all fades away
to you and me (5x)
