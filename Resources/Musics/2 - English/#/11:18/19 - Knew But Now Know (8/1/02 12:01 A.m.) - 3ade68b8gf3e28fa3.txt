KNEW BUT NOW KNOW (8/1/02 12:01 A.M.)

You left us
While I'm struggling with all our insecurities
and when the lights go out do you think of me
ten days will pass and then I'll start to breath again
because without you there's no me
and evenknow you never went, part of me left

C'mon c'mon, phone isn't ringing
C'mon c'mon, clock isn't ticking
and when I say that I want you, know that I'm thinking
and futures to follow, your smile I'm screaming now
I never really knew, but now I do
It's midnight, it's midnight, it's midnight, it's 12:01

I hate the months that start without you
and please believe me if only once, I could tell you
your voice helps, it helps me get through the day
and what I needed to feel, I finally figured out
Now after sunrise it's your favorite day, (Thursday)
just do it one more time, please for me...ring, ring, ring

C'mon c'mon, phone isn't ringing
C'mon c'mon, clock isn't ticking
and when I say that I want you, know that I'm thinking
and futures to follow, your smile I'm screaming now
I never really knew, but now I do
It's midnight, it's midnight, it's midnight, it's 12:01


What if you only knew and someday were put together for us
then maybe you would realize what I'm talking about
and see that the truth between us can make a stone bleed
but if it got on you no matter what it would be my fault (my fault)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Forgive me, I'm sorry
Just feel me, looking through you (6x)
