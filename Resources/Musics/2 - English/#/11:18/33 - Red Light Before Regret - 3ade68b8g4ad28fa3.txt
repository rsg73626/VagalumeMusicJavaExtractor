RED LIGHT BEFORE REGRET

Don't you waste another thought on me, please
wind blowing right through my fingers
and your eyes pierce when you look at me
I can't lie anymore
or hide this inside
you're so cold to me
and I'll always be colder than you are

Can't stand the chorus
Remember when we kissed under the moon
Can't stand this song, anymore
I must make you cry
you hurt me, no
another lie
I hurt myself, I hurt myself

Tear up my songs
I really hate them, anything I have done
they could never tell anything
so just burn them
I never made you smile
I always bring you down
you know you'd be happier (so much happier)
with him

Can't stand the chorus
Remember when we kissed under the moon
Can't stand this song, anymore
I must make you cry
you hurt me, no
another lie
I hurt myself, I hurt myself

The music makes me die
staring at space through a car stereo
does nothing mean anything
just stop me,
just stop me before I make you cry
make you cry (4x)
