ONE MOMENT CAUGHT IN TIME

Soaking my head once again
to drown my fears until you said,
("Down the line but never crossed")
These silly games that we pretend
Another ocean made of friends

The harder we want to fall
the long we'll keep this going
I want, but can't see at all
our truth will just keep showing

The mirror
on the wall
me standing
in front of it
and you're there
behind me
so softly
whispering this
and than we
could see
how great face
to face could be
it could be......

One moment caught in time
is not enough
to hold you here with me
in my mind
and in my life
