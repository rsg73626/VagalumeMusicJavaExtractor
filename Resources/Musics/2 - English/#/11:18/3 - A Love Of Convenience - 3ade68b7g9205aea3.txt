A LOVE OF CONVENIENCE

It's good to see you again 
yea, that's what I said 
It's good to see you again 
and don't pretend..... 

(chorus) 
That you wanted me 
and everything that comes with me just being me 
and I don't care 
about anything, except time spent on your street 
why won't this stop 
or maybe start is what we really want this to be 
I need you now 
more than anything, in due time 

Over and under my skin 
It's good to see you again 
Convenience only gave us the night 
It's good to see you again 
Over and under, under and over again 
Over and under 
(Talking, " I could have left you know. I could have gone without your voice") 

Why can't I see....... 

(chorus) 
That you wanted me 
and everything that comes with me just being me 
and I don't care 
about anything, except time spent on your street 
why won't this stop 
or maybe start is what we really want this to be 
I need you now 
more than anything, in due... 

I know, I see you 
there, under there 
I know, I see you 
here, over here, I (4x) 
(Said no to Virginia, waiting for tonight) (3x)
