THE PRINCESS AND THE TOAD

Could you ever wish upon the stars
and make them all come true
Ever really feel love surrounded in my arms?
my favorite color is blue
I sit, I'm longing and thinking am I sinking
in you?

and if I was, would it be bad?
if I wanted to, would you let me?
I felt I always held you back
oh why did God make you so sexy

(Chorus)
I'm wishing upon
every star up in the sky
I'm making stupid plans in my stupid head
You know the truth but do you pretend?
I want things I promise myself
to someday happen
and actually last

Two heads
pulling me in both directions
everytime I see
your face
and it's staring back at me (staring back at me)
I'll always be

(Chorus)
wishing upon
every star up in the sky
I'm making stupid plans in my stupid head
You know the truth but do you pretend?
I want things I promise myself
to someday happen
and actually last
just last
promise me they'll last

In dreams I am happy
but my outlook is haunted with reality
Sweetpea do you want this?
baby do you want me?
no words, just show me
just nod yes or no
Cause you'll always be a princess and I'll always be the toad
