EYES WIDE SHUT

We, start out only armed with stones
We, start out only armed with stones
He, could never look or break my bones
I'll attack out of nowhere
and you'll disappear just as quickly

Take the warning instead of, this invitation
until you finally see that, you had it coming to you
and one day when it can be
you'll see I keep her happy
and I want you to know
that memories fade through time

(Chorus)
They're closing, They're closing now
They're closing, They're closing now
I'm going, Going somehow
somehow, I'm going somehow
and when I get there I will show (when I get there I will show)
what I see (what I see), what I've seen (what I've seen)
and the fact that kills me, and hopes to spill me
is that you never saw it before

Wait...
I got one more complaint
your ghost is in my head
but I'm gonna kick you out
eyes wide shut, falling deeper
before it shuts down (before they shut down)

(Chorus)


Wait...
I got one more complaint
your ghost is in my head
but I'm gonna kick you out
eyes wide shut, falling deeper
before it shuts down (before they shut down)
