POPULAR AND UP A TREE

There's no beginning to this song
There's no beginning to this song
I wish you stayed and now I'm going on
Yea, no beginning to this song

20 questions come and go
true colors always show
but your just hurting them -
oh wait your hurting me (Grab my arm tighter)
I don't wanna move forward, I don't wanna move back
just stick in this single place in time
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
go.....

Take a step outside yourself it's cold
imperfection's just a stage
so play it over again now and see
what I could be, if I wanted to be
popular and up a tree
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
go.....

It's funny all I wanna hear
is bottomlines fly through my ears
and when there's nothing left to fear
there's bottomlines that end in tears
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
that end in tears
take cover
you ready? go
go...
