HOPE IS OVER RATED

The moon is rising now
I can see it from a distance
it comes up as i fall down
reminds me of useless persistence then i look back
and recall that time for that moment
i truly believed you'd be mine
maybe it was never meant to be
but those few minutes were precious to me

I'm falling like a broken dream
any reasons are unseen
hope is over rated

I've said my prayers wished upon a star and nothing has come of this so far
simply stated I'm here but you're there and nothing more will come of this today
why were the times with you such bliss
why did i have to reach for a kiss
can i ask what i did wrong
no answers as thoughts play through my head

I'm falling like a broken dream
any reasons are unseen
hope is over rated

Never thought it was doomed to fail
it was acted well when it seemed that you cared
alone on the beach as i stare along the shore without you is so bare
why were the times with you such bliss
why did i have to reach for a kiss
can i ask what i did wrong
no answers and thoughts play through my head

I'm falling like a broken dream
any reasons are unseen
hope is over rated

Relationships are gone like the sky
the stars said good-bye and now the turn is mine
now if you wont tell me why I'll know that it's a lie
nothing is ever fine
you're love was just a dark disguise
the one that I despise
its funny how time flies
you'll always be just a girl who denies the fact she cries...
