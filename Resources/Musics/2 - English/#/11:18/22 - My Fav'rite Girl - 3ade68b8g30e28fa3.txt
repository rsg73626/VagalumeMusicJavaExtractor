MY FAV'RITE GIRL

My fav'rite girl
My fav'rite girl
Says what she wants
When she's with me
Well she's so smart
And is her hair soft!
And where she is
That's where I'll be

When she gets up in the morning
And she turns open the blinds
I tell her I like her t-shirt
Then she says thanks because she is so kind

One time we went to a movie
One time we went to a show
She is my friend and i love her
Even when her parents tell me to go
