HAZY MOON

What do you do when your life has become
the calm before the storm
when it leaves you feeling numb.
Then you try to find the answers
with only one question,
Where did the stars go?

What's the use in lying
when you're not true to yourself
and summer's way to soon
and I can see you cryin'
with your good book on the shelf
underneath a hazy moon

Why is it we find peace, in looking up at the sky
the clouds, the stars, the moon
will always try and pass us by
but we have to remember
to not float up there together
when what's important is down below, looking right back up at it...

What's the use in lying
when you're not true to yourself
and summer's way to soon
and I can see you cryin'
with your good book on the shelf
underneath a hazy moon

Trees will always fall, branches sometimes break
but here is where we'll be safe
sittin' on the deck we made.
