FORBIDDEN FRUIT

You are the forbidden fruit.
I cannot enjoy you,
Although I want to.
I know it sounds selfish,
Past, Present, Future,
but I wanna take 2 out of 3.

Right now...
You are another guy's girl,
One less deserving than me.
and...
you're both in 2 different places,
so why can't you see.

That you, are the forbidden fruit
ah and I can't get a taste
and you, can't choose between old and new
but here is where i'll wait.
here is where i'll wait.

Torture's comin, ha fun.
really wanna be with you,
sun is settin, yea right.
who who who?

You, are the forbidden fruit
ah and I can't get a taste
and you, can't choose between old and new
but here is where i'll wait.

and you say...

haha, I'm the forbidden fruit
yea and you can't get a taste
and someday maybe I will choose,
but here is where you'll wait.
here is where you'll wait,
here is where you'll wait,
HERE IS WHERE YOU'LL WAIT!!!
