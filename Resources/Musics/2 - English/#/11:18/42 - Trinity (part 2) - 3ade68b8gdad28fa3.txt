TRINITY (PART 2)

Sneak out
and see me now
you will know now
that with me
bad is the best thing you can be

Fly away
and get the hell out of here
they gave up
we're to strong for them
so there's nothing there to stop us anymore
hello goodbye
nothing but eye to eye
rumors of the hurt and lies

Giving it up
is not what makes me feel to free
I'll never ever
never ever
never ever
never ever
no...
