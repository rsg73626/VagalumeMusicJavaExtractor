TRINITY (PART 3)

Goodnight I'm tired
I'm tired goodnight
Goodnight I'm tired
I'm tired goodnight
My heart can't stop
It's racing all night
Goodnight I'm tired
I'm tired goodnight

Goodnight I'm sorry
I'm sorry goodnight
Goodnight I'm sorry
I'm sorry goodnight
I'm trying, I'm feeling you
although it's not right
Goodnight I'm sorry
I'm sorry goodnight

Goodnight I love you
I love you goodnight
nothing tells this feeling
this feeling inside
together is better
you make me feel alive
together, nothing's better
shhh turn out the lights
Goodnight I love you
I love you goodnight
