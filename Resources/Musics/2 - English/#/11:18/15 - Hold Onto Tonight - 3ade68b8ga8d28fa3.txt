HOLD ONTO TONIGHT

Friday night again
and I wanted to know...
one thing
Do I make you feel (make you feel)
Do I make you feel (make you feel)
Do I make you feel (make you feel)
Hold onto
Hold onto tonight

(chorus)
Happy
I said it
You know
Just don't forget it
Not Yet
you're right
In dreams I kiss you each night
Not fair
I miss you
this is what I hold onto

The sand always broke my fall
Never before
could I feel this way
and kill this hate inside of me (Finally)
Yea you see
me on the water
you and your everything
Hold onto
Hold onto tonight

(chorus)
