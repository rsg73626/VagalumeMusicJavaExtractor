Boy: "Hey, so what are you doing tonight?"
Girl: "Guess..."
Boy: "Really? Again?"
Girl: "Yea, it's what I do best"
Boy: "Always knew that"
Girl: "But always doubted..."

Can't you shoot me now, together I'm so lonely
Barred from you somehow, smooth until we fight...
ourselves... from killing this away from myself again
you're the queen of this panic and I'm due for punishment
so send your royal aggravations to sting me again

Boy: "If you fell, who would catch you?"
Girl: "Probably no one"
Boy: "I would, I'll never stop catching you"
Girl: "Why? All I do is cause you pain"
Boy: "Come here, feel what I feel"
Girl: "I'm scared"

Take this light, venture out into the world
you fell into night, so what if I need you sleeping
Just like always, sometimes least expectations are the plan
swallow my dreams, take the gun out of your left hand

So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known

Boy: "Hey, you still with me?"
Girl: "Wow, I never knew it could be that way"
Boy: "Today is over, it's now tomorrow"
Girl: "Game over then..."
Boy: "What?"
Girl: "Just don't start over"
Boy: "I promise, don't crash"
Girl: "Never"
