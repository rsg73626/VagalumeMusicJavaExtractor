PERFECT

I look at you there
Oh, I wish I could stare
And if I could I just would say
That you're the reason I woke up today

Cuz now I know that you're the one for me
Yeah, even if you don't know it just yet
And now I know that you're the one for me
Yeah, even if I can't show it just yet

I can see that you don't know
Is it worth all my trying for you?
If I could, I just would show
That I'm all alone dying,
waitin' and
tryin' for you...

But you're perfect
Yeah you're perfect
But you're perfect
You're too perfect
So perfect......

Distinction, rejection, affection... ahhh it's these things that make me true...
Devotion, compassion, perfection... ohhh it's the things that I see in you...
