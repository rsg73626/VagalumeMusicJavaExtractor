MAGIC HAPPY BOUNCY BALL

A plane flies overhead
and your bored to tears
just wanna goto bed (goto bed)

Every time I think of you
I think of my magic happy bouncy ball
and I want to goto bed
and I want to goto bed
I want (I want) I want (I want) I want (I want) I want (I want)
to goto to bed with you

(Chorus)
Everything is innocent
when everything is sweet
and nothing will ever make me feel this way, again
That's why
me and my

Magic happy bouncy ball
together we can have it all
me and my magic happy bouncy ball
I saw your smile and had to fall
cause...

(Chorus)
Everything is innocent
when everything is sweet
and nothing will ever make me feel this way, again
That's why
you, and I
will give my magic happy bouncy ball to you
