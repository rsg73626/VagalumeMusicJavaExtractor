WHEN WAVES HIDE

Hey...
Remember when we snuck away
so we could be alone
On the sand when I wish you stayed
feels like home

yea...
and nobody, nobody, no one
could compare to your touch
it's all i've ever been wanting
like our every second was fading
I'd break the clock if time would stop

Last night driving home
past a beach I know
11:18... you, all you
11:18 I need you....
We could stand there forever
Music surrounding us
no sound that we can hear
but it's there, but it's there
just listen...

(talking)
I know, I....
still can't believe this
I know, I....
feel it when I hold you
hey, hey
they're there
they know we're here
shhhhhh
just....
just crash
