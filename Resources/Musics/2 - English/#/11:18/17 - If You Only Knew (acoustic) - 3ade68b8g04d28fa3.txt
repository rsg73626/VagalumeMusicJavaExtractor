IF YOU ONLY KNEW (ACOUSTIC)

Speaking is something, rather than nothing. Cooling nights with moonless beaches under our skies. Everything that can't be seen by anything less than gracious eyes. That certain something that shines out of you. Comes shining out of you.
If you knew. If you knew. What you do... All the steps of this trip. Don't regret saying goodnight, because trying is worth the fight. When stars aren't out in the windows of our minds. Fear this and take no chances. Samantha if you only knew.
If you only knew... how many times I goto sleep with you in my mind. If you only knew... how much I need to hear your voice. If you only knew... how I wish I could touch you, forever in time. Problem's solved, out of touch but never out of time.
Did you know? Did you know? That this song was just a crutch, and the fear is over. All the steps of this trip. Don't regret saying goodnight, because trying's worth the fight. When stars aren't out in the windows of our minds. Fear this and take no chances. Samantha if you only knew.
Phone is ringing today louder and louder. (Phone is ringing) Life passed by yesterday like clouds unnoticed. (Life passed by) Heart beating faster tonight can't stand sleeping. (Heart beating faster) You smiling again in the corner of my eye, that look you gave me. (You smiling again)
Remember when we used to play out in the rain? Times were simpler than, but even if hard times lie ahead. Follow this song, if you only knew. If you only knew. if you only knew...
