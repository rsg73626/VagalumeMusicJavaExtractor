MY LEFT HANDED GUN

You made me cry today
from now on i'll never be the same
something clicked
and made me see that you are just like the rest
not worth the chance
I'll now take what I get
and not take a second glance

(Chorus)
you want to give up
you already have
and i'm sitting here
with a gun in my left hand
the pain shoots through my body
and finally when it's done
I cry
I cry
for the damn world has won

It's such strong shit
I must speak in song
cause you don't understand
my spoken words
you don't want to listen
i'm worth it
i'm only human
why the hell
does he come to see me
you don't even try
nonnooooo

(Chorus)
you want to give up
you already have
and i'm sitting here
with a gun in my left hand
the pain shoots through my body
and finally when it's done
I cry
I cry
for the damn world has won

my left handed gun
my left handed gun
it wants to show you
can it show you
it wants to show you
wooooaahhhhh
my left handed gun
it's all my pain
all my pain
killing me slowly
oh so slowly
