STARING RIGHT BACK

You know what I think
I think I'm gonna sink
sinking in your sun
I'll float up when I'm done
And when everything
all comes back to me
I'll still be right here
sinking in your sea

But maybe....
bombs could drop
then there's cops
I never want to go
but I can't have it stop
In due time is nothing
but the middle is something
only not the top

(Chorus)
And I'll be there
to get in your face
when nothing seems to be there
and I'm there
to step in your way
when life ain't fair

You know this is not the way
lookin' right in front of you
hate the flavor, but love the taste
staring right back, right back
right back, right back
right back, right back
staring right back out at you
