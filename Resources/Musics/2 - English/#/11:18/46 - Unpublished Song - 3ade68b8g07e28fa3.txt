UNPUBLISHED SONG

Are you free? Answer, answer
or are you locked up waiting for me
Are you free? Answer, answer
or do you fight to hold the key
but when no one's praying for you
I am out looking for escapes
or ways
away

(Chorus)
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
We're waiting, I'm whining, they're lying, you're crying,
no no. stop, stop, stop
Almost trying, always flying, never never never dying

I can hear you
Just scream louder
I can hear you
a little closer
fight your way
fight the step that's blocking you

(Chorus)
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
We're waiting, I'm whining, they're lying, you're crying,
no no. stop, stop, stop
Almost trying, always flying, never never never dying

Are you free? Answer, answer
or are you locked up waiting for me
Are you free? Answer, answer

Cheat me down now
Cheat me down now
Cheat me down now
Cheat me down now
Cheat me down now
Cheat me down now
