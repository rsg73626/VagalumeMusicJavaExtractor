NEVER LEAVE

tell me that you'll never leave, cuz you know I'm lost alone,
tell me that you'll never go, cuz you're breakin my heart,
don't leave don't go.
cuz everything is better with you than without you,
and anything is better than on my own again.

sometimes it's just so hard to take a chance,
but just a second guess and it's to late,
so many broken hearts along the way,
another empty promise every day

do you care will it bother you,
enough to make you stop and think,
about the stupid things you say,
the lie's you tell and the games you play

sometimes it's just so hard to take a chance,
but just a second guess and it's to late,
so many broken hearts along the way,
another empty promise every day

i thought we'd last, until the end of time
but know i see the truth in your eye's, and it breaks my heart,
i'd rather die than to see that look in your eyes, in your eyes
