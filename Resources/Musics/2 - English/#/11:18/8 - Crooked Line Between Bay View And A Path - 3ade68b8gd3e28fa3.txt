CROOKED LINE BETWEEN BAY VIEW AND A PATH

Drink up, Drink up, Drink up, Shut up
Anyway they need it
but I could walk away
everytime that I see it
but would you stay
if I was penniless and bleeded,
take your time, find a way
I am what I am (am what I am)
and for once that's ok
that's ok

(chorus)
Those lines, the strength to fill me up
lost in time, broken clock is not enough
fire wine, and all that comes with you
Just feel it and feel it now....
Those lines, the strength to fill me up
lost in time, broken clock is not enough
fire wine, and all that comes with you
and dream it, dream it somehow

I could speak silence all the way to live some more
and maybe one spark could brighten up your day
but when there's only one there's none and I'll still be a whore
Knowing if I left that I'd be right back here with you
we try so hard and get no where
you're telling me why should I care
and I'm telling you that...

(chorus)
Those lines, the strength to fill me up
lost in time, broken clock is not enough
fire wine, and all that comes with you
Just feel it and feel it now....
Those lines, the strength to fill me up
lost in time, broken clock is not enough
fire wine, and all that comes with you
and dream it, dream it somehow

Always had you, that's what you said
To me, to me
Always had you, that's what you said
To me, to me
Always had you, that's what you said
To me, to me
Always had you, that's what you said
To me, to me
