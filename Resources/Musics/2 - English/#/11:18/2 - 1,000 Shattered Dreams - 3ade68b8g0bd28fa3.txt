1,000 SHATTERED DREAMS

In front of mirrors
I wait to be seen
holding the hurt with one hand
you scream
(I could change
take this picture in my head
and rip it up in front of
what is holding me back)

(Chorus)
1,000 Shattered Dreams
it drowns the fire of what could be
take your faults and cancel them out
'cause it's broken fix it, broken fix me...

Fist full of sand falling through my fingers
like life which once held so much love
but this jaded hatred is all I have
to wish for, wish for....
to break me down again
(Where is the shortcut
I'm feeling you
I wish I was feeling you
now...)

(Chorus)
1,000 Shattered Dreams
it drowns the fire of what could be
take your faults and cancel them out
'cause it's broken fix it, broken fix me...

Your smiling at me
could I kiss that grin off your face
if not show me, if not you'll see
what, no chances really mean...
