BREEZE KNOCK ME OVER

The wind knocks me down
and the walls are shaking
when we're troublemaking
knock me down

Sky is perfect now
light and dark together somehow
breeze
knock me down
stand there, breathe
in and out somehow
with you

(Chorus)
Breeze knock me over and over again
Now I'm waiting for you
Just make your move
and knock me over now

Face up, clever grin
save faith, smile me in
drink it up, never wait
free fall, this is fate

(Chorus)

Twinkle, twinkle
all tonight
twinkle, twinkle
in your eyes
yea
missing, missing, you tonight
