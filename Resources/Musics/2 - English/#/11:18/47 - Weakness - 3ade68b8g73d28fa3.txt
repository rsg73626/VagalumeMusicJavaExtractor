WEAKNESS

Well hey it's stupid, it's dumb
What else can I say
No I'm not
hiding what I really wanna say

Day in Day out
you really got me wondering
where we're going
and if it's our destination

(Chorus)
If i'm not saying what I really wanna say
you never know cause it might come out on any given day
For when I talk or look at you
my head takes a spin
Cause all I want is you
and it's my only weakness

For some reason
I'm hiding around the corner
won't you come
looking a little farther

Sometimes it's hard
but we're only human
So let's stop
and think about what we're really doing

(Chorus) 2x
