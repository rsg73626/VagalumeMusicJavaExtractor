LAST WORDS

As you leave me here
my heart tears inside
I can't stop you now
your walking down that line
with your head strait down
looking to your feet
not looking back
for there's no words left to speak

You said I made myself
special without words
but how can that be true
when you give up
wow my heart would stop for you
Oh there are a million ways
to say "oh please stay"
but you'd still walk away

Somehow i feel left out
not apart of your life
At least it is what you want
damn how it hurts inside
if I could only tell
Sure I thought I knew you well
Please tell me I am wrong
These are my Last words
that shall never speak

As you leave me here
my heart tears inside
I can't stop you now
your walking down that line
with your head strait down
looking to your feet
not looking back
for there's no words left to speak
