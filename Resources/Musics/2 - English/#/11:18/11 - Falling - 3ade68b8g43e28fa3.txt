FALLING

(Chorus)
I'm forever falling falling
deep into your arms
forever falling falling
grab me now before I fall to far
I'm losing my thoughts
so tell me I'm not dreaming
I am falling into you

You say that it's crazy
I'm sure that its true
but thats not stopping
me from being enamored with you
for... (chorus)

Gaga that's the word
for how I react
when you look into my eyes
and speak with that voice
for... (chours)

You tell me to do what you want
what I want is you
words can not describe the
feeling but just know
that its true
for... (chours)

You must think I'm crazy
yes crazy about you
so please take me into your arms
and fall with me
