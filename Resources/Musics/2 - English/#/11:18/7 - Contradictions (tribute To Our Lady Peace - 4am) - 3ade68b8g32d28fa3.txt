CONTRADICTIONS (TRIBUTE TO OUR LADY PEACE - 4AM)

I hid from all your contradictions
and found that they had won
I blame myself for all your lonely tears
we always fought
I never thought we would have to wait
then your words made me realize
I'm wrong

(chorus)
If I don't make it known that
I've loved you all along
just like the sunny days that
we ignore because
they're all dumb and jaded
and I hope to God I figure out
what's wrong

I fall around myself
not blinking
but thinking I had lost
I blame myself for being too much like
everybody else
I never thought I would just
bend this way
then you spoke and made me realize
I'm wrong

(chorus)

and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong 2x

(chorus) 2x
