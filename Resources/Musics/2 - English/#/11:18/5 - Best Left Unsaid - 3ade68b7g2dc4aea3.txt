BEST LEFT UNSAID

I'll wait for the skies to pour on me, for you 
Don't ask me why 
It's all the things we couldn't say 

These lonely eyes 
Leave me feeling far away from you 
Am I asking a bit too much from you 
Don't let me stand in the way of dreams you have 

A perfect vision of worlds colliding slowly 
Melting in the flames of fires warmly glowing 
Don't ask me why 
It's all the things we could never say 

These lonely eyes 
Leave me feeling far away from you
