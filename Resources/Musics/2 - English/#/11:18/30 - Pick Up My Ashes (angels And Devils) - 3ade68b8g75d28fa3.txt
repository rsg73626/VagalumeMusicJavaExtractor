PICK UP MY ASHES (ANGELS AND DEVILS)

Didn't you pretend to fall in love
and now the crisis is you're getting sick of me
Take this opener and stab
through the letters of words I can't show you
me always asking myself
Why don't you wanna see me tonight?
If I could only steal the sun and throw it at you
maybe then you will see the light

(chorus)
Constantly flooding my head with thoughts
of empty temptations that don't happen
Your words are a fire that's burning me to the ground
Always cleaning, why don't you pick me up like you used to
pick up my ashes, nap on me, hush, kill sound

So what if I want you
is it a sin to try and love you
forget taking what you get, in your heart you know the truth
and not having what you want should be killing you
So what if I need you
is it a sin to make you feel like you have never felt before
Just give this chance and take this touch
Feel this now and when it works you will know
that avoiding me is not the answer, us... together is better
nothing will ever come close

(chorus)
Constantly flooding my head with thoughts
of empty temptations that don't ever happen
Your words are flames that are burning me to the ground
Always cleaning, why won't you pick me up like you used to
pick up my ashes, nap on me, hush, kill sound


When you hold my face
my fingers through your hair
and then I'll always say I'll be there
with your warmth through cold
whisper to me
hold me tight, come on baby
and we all know something
tonight, tonight
just as long as we're outside
connection's made, one gazing stare
tonight's forever don't be scared

(2nd Chorus)
I know, I know-oo-woah-oo-woah-oo-woah-oo-woah
that you know, what we both know
and we now see, what we both know
angels... devils...
your angels
you angel
you fly me, fly me, fly me away
fly me away
please fly me
fly me away
