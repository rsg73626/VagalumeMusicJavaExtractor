IN THE EYES

You hold the picture
Though it goes unsaid
I know you question
Where you fit in
Among the faces
You hear their voices say
You are broken
So you hide away
Don't hide away

You are treasured
You are beautiful
In the eyes, in the eyes
Of the One who made you
You are perfect
You're worth more than you know
In the eyes, in the eyes
Of the One who made you

So you're different
Let them say you are
Cause you're the vision
Of the Father's heart
In the Father's heart

You are treasured
You are beautiful
In the eyes, in the eyes
Of the One who made you
You are perfect
You're worth more than you know
In the eyes, in the eyes
Of the One who made you

When the world has told you lies
You are priceless in His eyes
When the world has told you lies
You are priceless in His eyes

You are treasured
You are beautiful
In the eyes, in the eyes
Of the One who made you
You are perfect
You're worth more than you know
In the eyes, in the eyes
Of the One who made you

In the eyes, in the eyes (X6)
Of the One who made you

When the world has told you lies
You are priceless in His eyes
When the world has told you lies
You are priceless in His eyes
