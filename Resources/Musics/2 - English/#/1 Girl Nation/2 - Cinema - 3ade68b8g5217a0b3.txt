CINEMA

Girls night, out at the movies
Grab some popcorn and candy
Yay! Is the weekend
We're young and we're dreaming
That could be us on the screen

Now the credits are rollin'
And this got me thinking

If my life was a cinema
What would my story tell?
Would the tickets sell?
We're you in the frame?

If my life was a cinema
Did you play the lead?
Would you direct me?
Did I bring you fame?

If my life was cinema, cinema
Cinema my life, my life

Some days up like they're magic
Then some down like Titanic
I can be frozen, tangled and broken
But you show me a whole new world

Now I'm stuck in wonderland
And this got me thinking

If my life was a cinema
What would my story tell?
Would the tickets sell?
We're you in the frame?

If my life was a cinema
Did you play the lead?
Would you direct me?
Did I bring you fame?

If my life was cinema, cinema
Cinema my life, my life

Woah-ah ever have your life flash
Before your eye like?
Woah-ah did I tried to lie
Only think about I?

I wanna make this one life count
Before the clock runs out
Red carpet got me thinking
About what really matters now

You can have your flashin' lights
All this crazy got me like
You can have it, you can keep it
Don't need it, best believe it

I'm make your name bright
Shine like stars at midnight
Roll it back, roll it back, hit replay
You're the lead in my movie

If my life was a cinema
What would my story tell?
Would the tickets sell?
We're you in the frame?

If my life was a cinema
Did you play the lead?
Would you direct me?
Did I bring you fame?

If my life was cinema, cinema
Cinema my life, my life
