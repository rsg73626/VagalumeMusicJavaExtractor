DADDY'S GIRL

You heard me say my first words
Watched me crawl before I walked
People say I have your eyes
But I've always wanted to have your heart

Ooh One in a million
And I got to be yours

Our souls are forever tied together
Through tears and all the laughter
You love me like no other
You say I'm the center of your whole wide world
I'll always be my daddy's girl

You danced me across the kitchen floor
And we'll dance the day you give me away
You're the first call when I need advice
You always know the right words to say

Ooh One in a million
And I got to be yours

Our souls are forever tied together
Through tears and all the laughter
You love me like no other
You say I'm the center of your whole wide world
I'll always be my daddy's girl

The love that you gave me came from another
Passed down to me from a Heavenly Father
Who chose me as his daughter

Our souls are forever tied together
Through tears and all the laughter
You love me like no other
You say I'm the center of your whole wide world
I'll always be yours
Our souls are forever tied together
Through tears and all the laughter
You love me like no other
You say I'm the center of your whole wide world
I'll always be my daddy's girl
I'll always be my daddy's girl
