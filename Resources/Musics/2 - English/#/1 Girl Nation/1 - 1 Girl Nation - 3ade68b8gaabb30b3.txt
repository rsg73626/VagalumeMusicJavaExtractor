1 GIRL NATION

Hey There's a girl sitting all alone
Heart broke and I betcha didn't even know
You're there messing with your hair
You ain't got time and you just don't care
What's up with the he said she said
Drama Drama talking smack on the internet
Sister she's just like you
So dont talk trash cause you've been there to

It's Time For A Little Less Talk
A Little Less Talk Cause We Got Faults
It's Time For A Little Less Talk
It's Time For A Little Less Talk and Alot More Walk
Come Together As A One Girl Nation
Shout It To All Creation
Jesus Is Our Foundation
We Stand Strong It's A Revolution
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Let Me Break It Down Here's The Situation
It's Time For A One Girl Nation

Don't mean to be all in your face
It's in love so hear what I got to say
Take five if you can't say something nice
We're girl strong when we all stand unified

It's Time For A Little Less Talk
A Little Less Talk Cause We Got Faults
It's Time For A Little Less Talk
It's Time For A Little Less Talk and Alot More Walk
Come Together As A One Girl Nation
