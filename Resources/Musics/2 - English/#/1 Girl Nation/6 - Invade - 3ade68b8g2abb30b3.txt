INVADE

It's time to go hard
Elevating from the start
Doesn't matter where you are
We'll give God our only heart
There's something in the air something in the water
We can't be quiet anymore
We are sons and daughters
You have given us a reason to jump and shout
Tell the world about how we're sold out
No we're not afraid we are outlaws
We will live on the edge be a rebel
Oh Your love your love it has cover me
Gotta tell the world how to be free

We We Will Invade This World For You
Spark A Generation With The Truth
We We Will Invade This World For You
With All That We Do
We We Will Invade This World For You
Spark A Generation With The Truth
We We Will Invade This World For You
With All That We Do

With the darkness all around we'll shine our light bright
We will shake up this town everyday and night
Though the world will to tear us apart
You'll be in our heart
We are set apart

We We Will Invade This World For You
Spark A Generation With The Truth
We We Will Invade This World For You
With All That We Do
We We Will Invade This World For You
Spark A Generation With The Truth
We We Will Invade This World For You
With All That We Do

its time to go hard
elevating from the start
Doesn't matter where you are
