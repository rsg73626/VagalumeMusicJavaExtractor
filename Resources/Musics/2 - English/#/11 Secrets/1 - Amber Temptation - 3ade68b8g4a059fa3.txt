AMBER TEMPTATION

When the blue skys
turn gray, I know
It's time to save myself
and I know, until the end
I will bleed my soul

The same weak soul
That you hurt
I stoped to count the time
just to don't waste myself

You excite me
just to let me down
How many plans I made?
I don't know
Just to find a way
to you
No way

But now I know
the same weak soul
always belonged to you
only and just for you
but you never belonged to me
