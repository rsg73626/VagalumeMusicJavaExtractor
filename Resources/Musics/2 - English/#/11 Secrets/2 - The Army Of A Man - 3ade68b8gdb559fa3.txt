THE ARMY OF A MAN

I always fight alone
my life is a battle
that I probable never win
I never wanna be the same
I always need a change
just to try to survive

I'm a army of a man
I can lose a battle
but I will win the war
The army of a man

Every fucking day is a battle
and I got no choice
running alone on a two ways besides
I tried to take a handle
but if you wanna something right
you have to do yourself

Maybe life is a real war
and I need to survive
Always alone, living on the run
living life like a glass
no have a chance to fall

The army of a man
