WIND UP SPACE

Even though I'm glad I met you
I regret the bitter taste
Not having you
It feels like a nightmare
Even as I'm lost without you
I could never carry in your place
So sadden me
And leave me a note

Please don't say anything
I need you just to know
That I'm missing your soul
Before we get so far away
Can we wind up space?

Even though I thought I knew you
I'll admit, I didn't check
It's pulling me
Back into a nightmare
Even with the bitter taste
I miss every moment in your space
So sadden me
And leave me alone

Please don't say anything, no
I need you just to know
That I'm missing your soul
Before we get so far away
Can we wind up space?

Before we lay down
And fall into our very last moments
Before we get so far away
Can we wind up space?

Even though I'm glad I met you
I regret the bitter taste
Not having you
It feels like a nightmare
Even as I'm lost without you
I could never carry in your space
So sadden me
And leave me a note
