APATHY

Surprised to hear your voice
Coming through my telephone
The last time that we talked
Was about two years ago

And I'm too afraid to ask
But I wonder why you called
Think I know the reason why
Do you think that you were wrong?

Don't take me back to the place where
You let me go with a reason
Just grip the time when we were thinking
We were nothing but a state of apathy

You're asking me to think
About the love that we had
But there was not enough
For me to go back again

You know how much it hurt
When you left me that way
Nothing else you can do
And there's nothing you can say

Don't take me back to the place where
You let me go with a reason
Just grip the time when we were thinking
We were nothing but a state of apathy

Apathy, apathy, yeah, yeah
Apathy, apathy, yeah, yeah
Apathy, apathy, yeah, yeah
Apathy, apathy, let me go!
