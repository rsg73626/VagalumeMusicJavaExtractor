BETTER WAYS

Whatever it takes, to make you mine
Now sharpen your teeth and bite my pride
Whatever it takes, no I won't mind

No I won't mind without you
No she said, I can't work this hard for you
No she said, I can't work this hard for you

You showed me everyday,
All of the better ways
Of living everyday,
It's true

You took it all away,
All of the better ways
Of living everyday,
It's true

I suck it up
It's like dying again
You fought with the words
You held in your hand

Stop wasting away, the better ways
Stop wasting away without you
With life in motion, this emotion is real
With life in motion, pure emotion is real
