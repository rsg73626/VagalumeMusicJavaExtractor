SUPERNAUT

Practially every one of the top 40 records 
Being played on every radio station
In the United States is a communication 
To the children to take a trip, to cop out, to groove

The psychedelic jackets on the record albums
Have their own hidden symbols
And messages as well as the lyrics
To all the top rock songs 
And they all sing the same refrain:
It's fun to take a trip, put acid in your veins

I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun but I don't want to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
I find the distance melts away with the spoon

Supernaut
Supernaut

I've crossed the ocean, done every land
I found the pot under a golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years it never bothered me

Bothered me
Supernaut
Bothered me
Supernaut

They all sing the same refrain:
It's fun to take a trip, put acid in your veins

Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I got no need to pretend

Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I leave it all behind

Supernaut
