WAKING UP THE GHOST

No one knows
The secrets that I keep
No one knows
What's in my head
I can't control
The other side of me
I have lost my breath

Breaking
The pulse of a steady beat
Pleading for sanity
The voices calling out my name

Now I'm afraid that I
Am waking up the ghost
Not digging up the memories
That were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy
That's inside of me

Under the skin
The soul of the guilty
Under the surface
Lonely lies
Under the weight
The sin is
Eating me alive


No mercy
No forgiveness
Condemn to my own hell
The voices calling out my name

Now I'm afraid that I
Am waking up the ghost
Not taking out the memories
That were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy that's inside of me

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah

I am waking up the ghost
And digging up the memories
That were dead to me
I am waking up the ghost
And digging up the memories
That were dead to me
Now, Now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy
That's inside of me

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
