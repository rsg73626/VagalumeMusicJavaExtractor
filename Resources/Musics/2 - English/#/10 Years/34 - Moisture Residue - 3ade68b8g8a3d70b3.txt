MOISTURE RESIDUE

I'd rather sink then swim
Give up, give in, and let my demons win again
My whole life I've tried to keep my head above water
And out of the clouds I'm face down on middle ground

So I release this breathe
From my chest
As I lay to rest
Deeper and deeper
With a fish
I pray peace may find me

Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
