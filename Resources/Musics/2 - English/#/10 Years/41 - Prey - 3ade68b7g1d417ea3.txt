PREY

One at a time
One in the same
One is the time
That remains
Snip back the weak before they give away
I'm twisted in knots from hard work and strain

I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind

All at a time
All in the same
Califormula
I've become prey
Strolling down
In my face
These tears I'm not crying
This will not kill me

I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind

To do this right
We must realize
Everyone kneads equally

I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind
