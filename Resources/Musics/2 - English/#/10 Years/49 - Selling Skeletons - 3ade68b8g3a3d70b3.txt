SELLING SKELETONS

Aim high as you look to the sky
And shoot for the stars
Playing darts in the dark
Lose control as you go for broke
Giving one for the money
And two for the show

Chasing your tail
Till the brain swells
And your heart turns pale
Enter the void
As you search and destroy
But can you avoid
Getting lost in the noise

You're desperately selling skeletons
Until there's nothing left
Everything falls apart
Keep relying on dead stars

With everyone's eye on the prize
We kiss our loyalty goodbye
And it should come as no surprise
When we live and die
By rolling the dice

Cut me to the core
For more and more and more
Cut me to the core
For more and more and more
Desperately selling skeletons
Until there's nothing left of me
Everything falls apart
Keep relying on dead stars
