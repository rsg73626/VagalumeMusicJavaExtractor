DAY DREAMER

I can't seem to change you or open up your eye's
So go on and sing your sad, sad song.
I don't even blame you the routine is nice.
Nine to five and a suit and tie.
Fear of failure a comfort zone is killed.

Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.
So what's your excuse?

Life can't seem to teach you the safe caught is right.
So stray from the fight.
Don't you realize?
The daydreamers nightmare is to never even try.
You kind of slipped by.
Fear of failure a comfort zone is killed.

Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.
So what's your excuse?

Take a step back and find a way out of here.
Can't you see the answer is loud and clear.

Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.
So what's your excuse?

Find a way out of here...
