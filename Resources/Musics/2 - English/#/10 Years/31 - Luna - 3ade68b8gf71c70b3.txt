LUNA

I spoke too soon
But you hung the moon, and don't even have a clue
Bright eyes stay tucked away
Deep inside you're gonna age?
Safe to (as) sume you're gonna age?
Safe to (as) sume of you?


A little roll, a little sway, to navigate
Through your maze of love and pain
We bond and break through love and pain
We bond and break


So rain down on my head
When the sky cracks open
And your pain comes, let the blood run through my lungs
When the rain comes, I'll be the sun
When the rain comes


So now I see you're free from me
I wait patiently
For you to breathe


So rain down on my head
When the sky cracks open
And your pain comes, let the blood run trough my lungs
When the rain comes, I'll be the sun
When the rain comes
