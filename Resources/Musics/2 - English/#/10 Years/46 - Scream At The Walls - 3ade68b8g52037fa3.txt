SCREAM AT THE WALLS

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen

Confusion sets in
With no beginning or end
Frozen in place
The scenery's unraveling

Hanging on by a thread
The child is screaming
While holding his breath
Hanging on by a thread
The child is screaming
While holding his breath

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen

Forever you face
The fear of being erased
No need to speak
They'll pass you by and wonder why

You're hanging on by a thread
You throw away everything
From holding your breath

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen

Biting your tongue
The top of your lungs
Biting
Biting
Biting your tongue

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen
