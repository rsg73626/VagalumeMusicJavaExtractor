DANCING WITH THE DEAD

Blaze rage red is the color of youth
Be careful what you do
Another dead, color bled, blue is new
Be careful what you choose

Little white lies, trouble hides the truth
Bury your excuse
Every bird sings when they're envy green
It's time to come clean

Fallin' like a stone again
Dive in, deeper down you go

Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end
Keep dancing with the dead
Go ahead
Keep dancing with the dead

Eyes pitch black with the heart attacks
You can barely move
The other weak ones were the first to run
Your loyalty is through
Every word's gold when the story's told
It's time for you to fold

Fallin' like a stone again
Dive in, deeper down you go

Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end
Keep dancing with the dead
Go ahead
Keep dancing with the dead

The devil's in your head
Filling in the stance
God is playing dead
So save your breath

Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end
Keep dancing with the dead
Go ahead
Keep dancing with the dead
