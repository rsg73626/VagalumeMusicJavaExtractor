MISCELLANEA

Cross the finger on
That tingles in you
You've got the world
My love to one truth
Loaded skies
Are brushing bright
My eye invite uninvited
Wish you're amused
So make a move

Running toasted
You're right
You're wrong

Clue by clue
Can you take the tool
When your vintage is in bloom

Running toasted
You're right
You're wrong
