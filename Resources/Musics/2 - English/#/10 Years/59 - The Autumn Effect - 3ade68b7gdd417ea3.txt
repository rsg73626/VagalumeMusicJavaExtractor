Climbing Jacob's ladder
Climbing Jacob's ladder
Kindly could you re-evaluate
Autumn's animated growth

Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Keep on fighting one died from burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly stole the breath of body, mind and soul

Try and come to willingly embrace
Kharma's kiss of withering decay
Death feeds, Hell breeds
Subside in the Autumn

Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Keep on fighting one died from burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly stole the breath of body, mind and-

Silent beauty
No one cares
Silent ending
No one is there
