SILHOUETTE OF LIFE

Forced myself to sleep last night
Woke up to all white
Saw all the tears and cries
Screamed out with no reply
Nirvana dreams were never right
When crossing to the other side
It's too late to take this back
This accidental exit

Now what's in store for a
Soul with premature
Wings that will never soar
For what they're made for

Why we wingless angels fall
We'll die if our wings don't grow at all
(so tell me)
Why we wingless angels fall
We'll die if our wings don't grow at all

Life is always strange
Signs lie wondering
Mental sodomy
This can't be happening

(so tell me)
Why we wingless angels fall
We'll die if our wings don't grow at all
Why we wingless angels fall
We'll die if our wings don't grow at all
