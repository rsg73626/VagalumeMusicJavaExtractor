DEAD IN THE WATER

Blessed are he who are speaks the word
Grateful that we can lead the herd
Dollars signs in the faithful eyes
The anti fate on day disguise
You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Wont make you our savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on father out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

Blessed are he who sees the word
Holiness are well rehearsed
Dollars in the faithful eyes
Anti fates on day disguised
You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Wont make you our savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you


Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on father out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

The water
The water
The water

Money made messiahs
You're televised to tell yours lies
Modern of a martyr
You're dead in the water

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on father out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water
