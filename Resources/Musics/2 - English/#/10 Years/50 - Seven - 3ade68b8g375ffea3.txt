SEVEN

My lapse in life I cannot lie
Compels me to wonder why
My valid try is so far from divine

See you running (See you running)
The only way to fall is down

Strive to beat what eats within
Go ahead and drown the kid
Who thought could reach the rim
Of all the dreams once spoon fed
Hold you up to the sky
Leave you there just one more time
My valid try so far from divine

See you running (See you running)
The only way you've known how
See you running (See you running)
The only way you've known how

Back and forth I cannot take this
Forced euphoric fabrication
Held in place the heart is weightless
Breaking down I need a facelift

Don't stare at the wall (x4)

See you running (See you running)
The only way you've known how
See you running (See you running)
The only way you've known how
See you running (See you running)
The only way you've known how
See you running
The only way to fall is down
