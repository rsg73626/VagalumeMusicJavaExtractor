NOW IS THE TIME (RAVENOUS)

Appetites reach all time highs
No ones seems to care who dies
Prey on every little thing in sight
To kill or be killed state of mind
Anything to stay alive
Never ever show you're terrified

It's a common casualty to trust in what you see
Saints and scholars, don't even bother
The bullet in the blood came from those you love
Friendly fires, death by a liar

Dumb, deaf and blind
Fall back in line

Now is the time to open your eyes
You need it, you want, you did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire and bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time

Focus now on how to gain
Loyalty from enemies
Waiting patiently for when to strike

The bullet in the blood came from those you trust
Friendly fires, death by a liar

Dumb, deaf and blind
Fall back in line

Now is the time to open your eyes
You need it, you want, you did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire and bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time

Those ravenous bastards always get what their after
Those ravenous bastards always get what their after
Those ravenous bastards always get what their after
Those ravenous bastards

The virtuous ones always circle like a storm
The carnivores rip into the core
For more and more and more
They rip into the core

Now is the time to open your eyes
You need it, you want, you did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire and bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time
