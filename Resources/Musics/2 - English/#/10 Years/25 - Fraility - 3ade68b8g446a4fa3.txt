FRAILITY

Discomposed as a whole
A kindred gift
Barely possessed
Struggles with lack of control
Meet our mistakes, and put on display
Stone me like a martyr
Making it much harder
Time just might beat out my will to overcome

Envious
A simple touch
All of this longing
Hollowed out longings of chimera

Bend and fold
Reform the shape
Force into place
Cant uphold
Devouring the author weakening their order

Envious a simple touch
Hold tight
Why's this even questioned at all?
Why's this even questioned at all?

Turning around, crawling with vengeance,
Tempts me
Tearing around tearing it out
Fraility
