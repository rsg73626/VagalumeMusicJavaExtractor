WAKING UP

Distance and space allow emotions to age into faith
Our bodies may end up alone but close

Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

Just in the way all your fingertips touch me
They are healing
One day we'll all fall prey

Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fears of
Distance away (a weight) distance away

Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fear love
