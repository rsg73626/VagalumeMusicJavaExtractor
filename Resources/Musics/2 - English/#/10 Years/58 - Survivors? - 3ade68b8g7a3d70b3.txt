SURVIVORS?

Sail away in sore eyes
Searching for your soul
Further from my shoreline
I pray that your sore eyes float
And are there any survivors, survivors?
And are there any survivors, survivors here?

Lost in the moonlight
You crash into my coast
I'm waiting for your high tide
To wash away my sore eyed soul
And are there any survivors, survivors?
And are there any survivors, survivors here?

Wide awake in the bed you've made
Wide awake in the bed you've made
And are there any survivors, survivors?
And are there any survivors, survivors here?
And are there any survivors, survivors? (survivors here?)
And are there any survivors, survivors here?
