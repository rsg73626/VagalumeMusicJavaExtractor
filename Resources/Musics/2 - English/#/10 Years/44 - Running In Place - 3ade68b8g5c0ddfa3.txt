RUNNING IN PLACE

The sounds bounce around
The noise just drowns me out
To fast to focus, nothing is showing
Any sign of slowing down
Dreams feed to me
In the form of a magazine
I can't control it, channels have chosen
What I'm supposed to be

It's hopeless
As far as I can see
There's no rest
'Cause we're stuck on repeat

Stand here and wait for the world to finally stop
Running in place, chasing after what we
Don't need, keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

Bright flashing lights
The ads just fill me eyes
Colors colliding, voices inviting
Me to buy a better life
She speaks to me
He knows just what I mean
I can't control it, I have to own it
Everything is made of green

It's hopeless
As far as I can see
There's no rest
'Cause we're stuck on repeat

Stand here and wait for the world to finally stop
Running in place, chasing after what we
Don't need, keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

For the world to finally stop
Chasing after what we want
Take it all away, flush it all away
We won't change

I'll stand here and wait for the world to finally stop
Running in place, chasing after what we
Don't need, keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

For the world to stop
For the world to stop
For the world to stop
For the world to finally stop
