VERTIGO

Bruises keep me moving
Abused by your precious pressures
Hopelessly hopeful romantically numb
Way too close for closure to come

Round and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Spinning out of control
Forever maybe only made in our dreams

Minimize my movements
Amused by your grand illusions
No love and no hate
Just phantom pains

Too soon too late to amputate

Round and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Spinning out of control
Forever maybe only made in our dreams

Hesitating hearts starving to start
Falling apart

Around and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Around and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Spinning out of control

Forever maybe only made in our dreams
Only made in our dreams
Only made in our dreams
