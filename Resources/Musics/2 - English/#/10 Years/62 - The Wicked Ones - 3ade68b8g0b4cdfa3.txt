THE WICKED ONES

She, she is the love that you make and break
And he, he is the drug that you hate to pray
And I, I am the liar you made to praise
And you, you are the one that we want a name

Who will convince us?
The wickeds will
Who condemn us?
The Wickeds will
Who will defend us?
The wickeds will
Always

We are the wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones who adore you
The wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones will destroy you
We are the lost of your innocence
We are the wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones hurrying for you

We, we are the scar of the skin again
Massive line to wondering eyes waiting, waiting to be
Bastard eyes, manipulize
Selling clones of every kind

Who will convince us?
The wickeds will
Who condemn us?
The Wickeds will
Who will defend us?
The wickeds will
Always

We are the wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones who adore you
The wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones will destroy you
We are the lost of your innocence
We are the wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones (the wicked ones)

Kill yourself to save yourself from yourself
Kill yourself to save yourself from yourself
Kill yourself to save yourself from yourself

Before you become one of us
Before you become one of us

We are the wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones who adore you
The wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones will destroy you
We are the lost of your innocence
We are the wicked, the wicked, the wicked ones (the wicked ones)

You will become one of us
