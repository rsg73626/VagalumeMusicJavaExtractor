ONE MORE DAY

The walls are closing in around us
We hold our silence like a gun
Your stare is empty and a scene that keeps repeating
And I just bite my tongue

They can't take this away, it's far from over
We cant take stay in a place we don't belong

For one more day, I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day, we try to save it all

Footsteps will fade away the memories
Unload the words and breathe again
Our eyes are focused on an unexplored horizon
And what has always been

They can't take this away, it's far from over
We cant take stay in a place we don't belong

For one more day, I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day, we try to save it all

I won't let you look back
If you will help me see clearly

They can't take this away, it's far from over
We cant take stay in a place we don't belong

For one more day, I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day, we try to save it all

For one more day, I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day, we try to save it all
