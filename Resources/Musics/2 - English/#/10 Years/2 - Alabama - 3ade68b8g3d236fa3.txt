ALABAMA

Oh I know your kind.
You would kill your kin for the right price.
Well water thicker than blood.
Oh I know your type.

Use us to get what you wanted.
You can't finish what you started.
Find it kind of funny how you try to rectify the damage.

Your failure to find compramize.
The walls are coming down.
Will you survive sacrafise or tummble to the ground?

Your lying to yourself.
And to everyone that knows your name.
You play the part of the fool so well.
Oh I know your type.

Use us to get what you wanted.
You can't even finish what you started.
Find it kind of funny how you try to rectify the damage.

Your failure to find compramize.
The walls are coming down.
Will you survive sacrafise or tummble to the ground?

Oh I know your type.

Your failure to find compramize.
The walls are coming down.
Will you survive sacrafise or tummble to the ground?
