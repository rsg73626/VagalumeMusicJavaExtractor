FALLAWAY

Crowned slow his decision is made
Even though he feels his courage fading
He knows in his heart that they are here
He draws his sword and sheathes his fear

So please just let me out
So please just let me out
So please just let me out
Then I could focus

Burning one more
Baptized in fire
Burning one more

She cries and she screams but her best never clears
She drops and kneels and her lips are bare
So please just let me out cuz theres nothing left to say
And as she stands she knows Im right there
She tucks her face, her tears are gone
Strength in their place

So please just let me out
So please just let me out
And if you let me out
Then I could focus

Burning one more
Baptized in fire
Burning one more
Baptized in fire
Broken, this stage
Found their strength through rage
So much more that

Fallaway
Fallaway
