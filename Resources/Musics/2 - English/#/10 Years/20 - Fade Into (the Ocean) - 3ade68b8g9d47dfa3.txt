FADE INTO (THE OCEAN)

Broken shoulders resting on my back 
Overloaded with a weighed stack 
Higher and higher 
Time runs tired 

Silence falls 
Into the deafening 
Sirens of 
My own epiphany (x2) 

My own mortality 

Here I lie with my regrets 
Possessions petty meaningless 
You are my medicine 
Healing me with tenderness 

I don't know 
Don't go (x4) 

I don't know what is happening 
What is happening 

Broken body crumbles into dust 

Weight is lifted sending me with love 
Higher and higher 
Time expired 

The siren calls 
Re awakening 
Passing on 
Into eternity (x2) 

Cry no more for me 

Crossing through 
Fade into (x3) 

Crossing through 
Fade into the light 
Fade into the light 

Crossing through [x2] 
Fade into the light (x2)
