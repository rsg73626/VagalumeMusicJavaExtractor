BLANK SHELL

(Verse 1)
In silence is all that helps
Only to feel your existence (stop)
Deny the truth that my life has changed
Hoping that this is all just a dream
Living inside of just what cannot be
No way to read your obituary
In say to in silence
So frequently rain
Bearing the place that reminds me of lain

(Chorus)
This isn’t what you really are
Blind folded through the hurt
So sorry
So sorry

(Verse 2)
Memories, my mind still replays
Comforts and thoughts
Still I awake
The presence of you is haunting for chase
Reflecting your image upon my face
Whispers, desires to know your at peace
Blank in the eyes, your vacant to me
Some with the spirit
Entirely thrown
Entirely throng
It’s time to move on

(Chorus)

Distant (3x)

Down in still frames
Turning the page
Let go
Let go your hope

(Chorus)
This isn’t what u really are
Blind folded through the hurt
So sorry
So sorry (for insult)

Drown in still frame
Turning the page
Let go
Let go your hope

Let go
let go your hope
Let go
Let go your hope
Let go
Let go your hope
Let go
Let go of your hope
