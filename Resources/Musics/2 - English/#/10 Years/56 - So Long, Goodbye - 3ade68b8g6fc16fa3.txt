SO LONG, GOODBYE

Keep changing your mind
Like clouds in the sky
Love me when you're high
Leave me when you cry

I know it all
It takes time
Like a river running dry
When the sun's too bright

So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light

Keep touching lies
Like a thief in the night
The sun will rise
And expose all the lies

So why deny that you and I
Live different lives
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind

So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light

The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind

So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light
