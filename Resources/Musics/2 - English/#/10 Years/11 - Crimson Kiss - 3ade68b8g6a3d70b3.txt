CRIMSON KISS

Tonight our separating sides
Unite as we try
To tame our tongues
Don't beg the question or
Kill with confession this time
Let's black out the sun and the sky
And paint the town red tonight
To feel alive
We will be kings and queens

Killer creator? Blow me away
I am your loaded gun
Killer creator? Blow me away
You are my chosen one
Out of our minds
Naive and younger
Inspiring this hunger inside
Invincible as a lie
Chasing horizon lines to feel alive
Your disease cures me

Killer creator? Blow me away
I am your loaded gun
Killer creator? Blow me away
You are my chosen one
Our separating sides unite
Killer creator? Blow me away
I am your loaded gun
Killer creator? Blow me away
You are my chosen one
