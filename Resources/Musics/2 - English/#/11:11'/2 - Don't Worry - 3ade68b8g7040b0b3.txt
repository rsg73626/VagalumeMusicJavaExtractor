DON'T WORRY

This bottle and these drugs
Are the only thing I need and want to love
Your pain keeps me sane
I know it's hurting, but

Don't worry
(I still fuck you, doesn't want to)
Don't worry
(I still love you, I don't want you)
(ooh yeah)
(ooh yeah)
1 Time for the liquor in my blood
2 Time for the baddies in the club
I'm sippin' on whatever's in my cup
Pour whatever to get my mind off this shit

Don't worry
(I still fuck you, doesn't want to)
Don't worry
(I still love you, I don't want you)
(ooh yeah)
(ooh yeah)
