YOU

I can advise
I can have the best night of my life
I can own the cars and clothes, the chains
But what you do to me is everything
Girl, I could own a billion dollar company
Or get faded with these drugs on me
But it don't matter
Cause I'm still here

Thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me?
Girl, I got 40 bitches tryna holla
And I don't want none

[chorus]
All I want is you
All I want is you
I just want you
Ooh
All I want is you
All I want is you
Girl, I got 40 bitches tryna holla
And I don't want none
I just want you

Baby, you can have a man
And I can have a girl
But I would do anything
To get you back in my world
Baby, just leave him
I rather us single
Than seeing other people
Cause I'm still here

Thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me?
Girl, I got 40 bitches tryna holla
And I don't want none

All I want is you
All I want is you
I just want you
Ooh
All I want is you
All I want is you
Girl, I got 40 bitches tryna holla
And I don't want none
I just want you
All I want is you
I just want you
Ooh
All I want is you
All I want is you
Girl, I got 40 bitches tryna holla
And I don't want none
I just want you
I just want you
Ooh
I just want you
Ooh
I just want you
