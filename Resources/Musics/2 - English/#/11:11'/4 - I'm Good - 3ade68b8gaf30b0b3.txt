I'M GOOD

Ain't nothin' else here better to do
Ain't no trapper better than you for me
Baby, sometimes you're here
You don't wanna make time for a nigga
You don't wanna come ride for a nigga

Stuck with each other for long
Now I'm writing on this song
Telling you wrong
There's no time for games
There's no time to play
Treated you good all along
Now I'm writing on this song
And I get nothing wrong
If you think that I need you
You got me fucked up

[chorus]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, yeah
Less cold without ya
I'mma be fine without ya
Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, yeah
Less cold without ya
I'mma be fine without ya

This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, woo
This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, yeah
This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, woo
This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, yeah

Spend my time givin' pleaure to you
You say you love me girl
And you'd never be cruel to me
Baby, sometimes you're here
You don't wanna make time for a nigga
You don't wanna come ride for a nigga

Stuck with each other for long
Now I'm writing on this song
Telling you wrong
There's no time for games
There's no time to play
Treated you good all along
Now I'm writing on this song
And I get nothing wrong
If you think that I need you
You got me fucked up

I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, yeah
Less cold without ya
I'mma be fine without ya
Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, yeah
Less cold without ya
I'mma be fine without ya

This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, woo
This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, yeah
This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, woo
This that shit you need right here
This that shit you need right here, yeah


I used to love when you changed
Right in front of me
Like it was nothing
I used to love when you asked me
To come instead
Now you done changed, woo!
