HENNY & GIN

Tell em fuck broke niggas get lost
Baby come here hit the floor
All yall niggas better beware
Cause I'm coming for yours
Wit money involved, I look at it all
(baby you know that I'm next)
They show me love, kush and the drugs

Now look at my ex, shit got 'em upset
Makin em wish that they never had left
They think I'm stressed but baby I'm blessed
Leaving your boy was the biggest mistake
Man that shit cray, left me to hang
Sippin' on henny and gin, left me to hang
