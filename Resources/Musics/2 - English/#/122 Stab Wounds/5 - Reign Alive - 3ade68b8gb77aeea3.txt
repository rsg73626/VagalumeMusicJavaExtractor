REIGN ALIVE

This night i come to you
And nail you to the floor
My face all over you
Enjoy and scream you whore

I bring you misery
Your body needs to bleed
I have to fix your lips
Your cold pale body i need

Feel my wrath come pouring down
I dress you in a wedding gown
I'll warm your body tonight
Until the sun's in sight

See the dead eyes
I gather my dead
And reign alive

Wish you could feel the pain
And taste the blade again
Death possess no regrets
In seconds break your neck with hate

The expression on your face
Your empty eyes caresses my soul
Drooling on your face and laugh
Sex and violence not enough
Consummation appeals to me
Long for pain infinity

I bring you misery
Your body needs to bleed
Hatred builds inside me
Oh, i adore this need

Life stands still
Moments of ecstasy
This need to kill
Visits me every day

See the dead eyes
I gather my dead
And reign alive

This night i come to you
And nail you to the floor
My face all over you
Enjoy and scream you whore
