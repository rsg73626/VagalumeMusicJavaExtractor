HOLOCAUST BREED

Ride The Fantasies
Of The Holocaust Breed
Like The Dogs Lusting For
A Bitch To Share A Bone
Like The Cats
We Are one With Night
We Possess
Eternal Life

Come With Us
Breath the Life
Feel It Growing, Growing Deep Inside

Legions of The Moon
Gave Birth To Chaos
Every Night They Hunted
Hunted For The Victory

Join The Holocaust Breed
Battles Fought
Mighty Are We
Who Slice The Heads
Hunters Are We
Join Our Legions
Marching Towards Destruction
Leaving Trails of Corpses

Come With Us
Breath The Life
Feel It Growing, Growing Deep Inside

Legions of The Moonshine
Gave Birth To Chaos
Every Night They Hunted
Hunted For The Victory
Ride The Fantasies
Join The Holocaust Breed
