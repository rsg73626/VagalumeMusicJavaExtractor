DIVIDED THOUGHTS

Bowing Before Me
Achieving A Violent Rush
Psychotic Pleasure A Need To Kill
Satisfaction In Orgasmic Thrills

Handcuffed To The Bed
Enslave My Perverted Divine
Blindfolded Experience In Nocturnal Pain
At Day or Night We Break All Silence

Trapped... In A Shadow of The Past
A Journey Into Pleasure Beyond
Begging On Your Knees Your Satisfactions My Ecstasy
Aesthetic Pain In A Violent Game

Blood And Sweat Impaled Her Skin
Divided Thoughts of How To Kill
Can No Longer Resist The Urge
Must End Her Silence
This Act of Violence Feeds My Need
A Bliss In Serenity
Glorifying Our Deed
A Moment of Deity
This Act of Violence Feeds My Needs
A Bliss In Serenity

Controlled Emotions... Energy
Lust Emerge From Oral Lust
Lick My Sweetest Touch
Delightful Reality

Psychotic Pleasure A Need To Kill
Satisfaction In Orgasmic Thrills

Breathing Heavenly... Salivating
Blossom... Eternal Passion
Around Us... Fire Burning
Flames Inside... We're Feeling
Around Us Fire Burning
Flames Inside We're Feeling

This Act of Violence Feeds My Need
A Bliss In Serenity
