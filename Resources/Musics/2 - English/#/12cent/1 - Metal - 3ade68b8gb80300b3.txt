METAL

Morning's here again, but I'll just stay in bed
I think I'd rather sleep the day away
Things have been worse before
I guess I can't complain
Just another day of doing what I love to hate

Time is a cruel thing, it never waits for me
The more I think about it, the more my life is pissed away
Cause I've spent most my time, looking for some answers
I should just shut my mouth and take my fucking chances

It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you
And Danny is crying again

Life is a moment, I can't forget today
Waste it all, wishing it was yesterday
Cause when I sing these songs, everything's okay
Jack up that stereo, we'll make it through another day

It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you
And Danny is crying again

Cause when I sing these songs, everything's okay
Jack up that stereo, we'll make it through another day

It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you
And Danny is crying again
It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you
