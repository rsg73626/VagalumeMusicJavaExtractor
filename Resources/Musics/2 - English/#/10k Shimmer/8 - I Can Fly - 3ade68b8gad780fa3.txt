I CAN FLY

All at once and once upon a time it was the same
Searching for that cornerstone to carve my name
Make the lines all fit, running side by side on the pages of my script
All the while eluding fame

Funny how I tried to be a little bit less ordinary
How could I have been so wrong

Look at me
Hanging off the edge
Holding on with just one hand
I think I can fly

She's running through my head. Could I hitch a ride on the trail of your last breath
Draw you in and hold you - I turn blue
Suddenly connections bind me hand and foot and drag in all directions
Draw me out 'till quarter to

Funny I thought this would be
A little more extraordinary
How could I have been so wrong

Look at me 
Hanging off the edge
Holding on with just one hand
I think I can fly
Look at me 
One foot on the ledge
I can hold by breath
I know I can fly

All I am I'll be I won't concede until it's up
Bending twisting turning reaching in to fill my cup
I offer no contrition and I hope that this confession is enough
Could it be enough
