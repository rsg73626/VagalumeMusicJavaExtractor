I HAVE ARRIVED

One mile to go.  It's about time she said
It took all night but now I'm fine
It was just one bridge to burn I sure do hope you like it
I'll tell you more when I arrive

Show me pictures of the way you were, how you wore your hair
How it covered up your eyes

From outside looking in I can see that there's a chance
Of getting caught up and torn away
And I wonder what it's like to be the one to do the
catching and the tearing of a promise that was made

I love to hear her sing but she could never carry a tune
Grace is not her thing but you should see her move
I know were getting older but these lines will grow together
Like they've always done before

I have arrived in an ordinary world
I am alive just to be inside of her
I am alive, I have arrived long before my days are running out

Up the hill and right on Merrimack is where we used to lay
Down with the shadows that are still there to this day
I know it's getting colder, but I'll let these arms surround me
They'll always keep me warm
