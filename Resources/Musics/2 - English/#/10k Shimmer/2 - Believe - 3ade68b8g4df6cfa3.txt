BELIEVE

I lost myself in a bar on B street last Sunday night
I drank to your health but the words caught in my mouth
And I choked them down

You misdialed 10 numbers, it's no wonder
It's so hard to remember
But it's not hard to find when your mind is well with wine
And losing time

I'm not one for holding on
But I still believe if you make me
You might know that hope is gone
But I still believe

I'm left searching the cobwebs in my head
I suppose I feel like running away
So I grab a cab down town cover my head to block the sound
And settle down

I'm not one for holding on
But I still believe, heaven help me
You might know that hope is gone
But I still believe

Hell washes over me, my will is all but spent
Treading water in a sea of malcontent
This is burning down and it's all my fault I know
But still the smoke curls 'round my head like a halo - oh no
