DREAM

I think it might be nice to sit in silence for a while
And not worry about where the lines fall.
I've said enough to write a book and now I'm goin' wild
The ringing in my ears starts to take it's toll

I saw you shining in the sun
One look at you and I come undone

I think it might be wise to shut my mouth up for a while
I'm straining too much from the volume of it all
Of course you're right, I shouldn't bark if I am not prepared to bite
But still there's pieces of me stuck inside your soul

I saw you shining in the sun
One look at you and I come undone
It's just a dream; slips like smoke though my fingers, wake with black on my hands
It's all a dream - it's got to be, 'cause I don't understand

I think it might be time to close my eyes just for a while
My head is spinning and my discipline is torn
In the dark it might be safer than to see you smile,
But still my memory keeps pounding out your form
