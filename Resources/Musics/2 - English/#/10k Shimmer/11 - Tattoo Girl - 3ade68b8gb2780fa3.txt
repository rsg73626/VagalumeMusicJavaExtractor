TATTOO GIRL

She sets herself one last time
To be the canvas.In her mind
She can feel the needle biting in 
To spread the black beneath her skin
That sting that used to catch her breath
Has grown tired and cold with each scarring caress
And the hum and the smoke hang heavy as her head
Float down through the cracks as she remembers what he said He said

I'm gonna write you a song
So I'll remember when you are gone
It's been 14 days without my tattoo girl
I'd go on and on so I'll just write you a song

She gets to sleep on books and wine 
That stains the pages every time
She's refreshingly a little bit crazy
How she looks right through me
He dreams of her breath upon his face
Getting tangled up in sheets to drown in her embrace
So he writes that words about the shape he's in
It's time like this that she pours out of him. Man, does she pour out of him

She wakes to the voices screaming, driving her toward something true
And he wants to know if she can hear him screaming for her too
Driving high through all the lights while staring at the moon
