GOOD ENOUGH

Broken bottles line the floor
They nip at my heels and make it hard to cross the room
The same as it was before,
Your perfume fills the air and makes it hard to think things through
So what's a guy to do

I was sitting here among the mess
Feeling bad I must confess
But all is good 'cause nothing comes for free
Then sanity she took a rest 
While you were puttin on that dress 
And that excuse is good enough for me

I don't care its good enough
I don't care its good enough
I don't care 'cause its good enough for me
And that's how it should be

On and on I've already heard of "the screwed up kid in a mixed up world"
Wasn't quite the effect that you hoped there would be
Your persecution complex, it get's to be such nonsense
And in a word "goodbye" is good enough for me

There's got to be a way that I can get away
And probably - I'd be better off if I didn't have to stay around here
If only I had a plan then probably
I wouldn't have to deal with things like cheesy lines and one night stands
Pick up all the pieces and put them in my hands
