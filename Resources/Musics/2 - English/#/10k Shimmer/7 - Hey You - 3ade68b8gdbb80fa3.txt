HEY YOU

Hey you, its 12 after 2 
And you're probably sleeping but I'm wide awake and dreaming
I'll leave you this; the show was a hit
My body aches but that's life on the stage
I'll see you in October, it won't seem to far
'till the trees are on fire just like we are

I won't be surprised if I see your face
Out in the crowd.  I see it everyday
A light in a sea of eyes,
I realize, so I sing

Fourteen exits and twenty more to go
This road is the black stripe across all I know
I hang my head, light another cigarette and make one last stand
That's how I am at 4 AM
Springtime is over, summer's long gone
But we'll have the winter.I'll keep you warm

I got your letter, its there on the table
But I won't be able to write you back now
I smell your perfume, it tastes like you used to 
Just one more show, then I'm coming home

One more thing, I was just wondering
Would you be around when I pull into town
I've got to see if you're real to me
Or if you're just from my daydreams
