BEFORE SHE WAKES

I'll lead the way as best I can
The answer may be more than you can stand
I'll resign the kind of time
To lead you on this exploration so
Fix you hair, straighten your skirt, we're almost there

If ever we fall, if ever we make it
We push through it all and sometimes we'd fake it
It's always the same before she wakes

It's alright to be afraid
All this doesn't fit with the plans that we made so I'll
save my best for later on
We can wait 'till the day is gone
then under than cover melt into each other then
Lie there wondering what went wrong

If ever we fall, if ever we make it
We push through it all and sometimes we'd fake it
It's always the same before she

She takes another picture of me,
Makes herself a carbon copy
then places it is straight design
in a frame she made on valentine's
Frozen staring through the glass,
a voyeur caught I watch as she gets high
then she says goodbye.

I think I'd like to be alone so
grab you things and head on home
I promise I will leave the light over the doorway on
