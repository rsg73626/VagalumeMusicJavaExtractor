BREATHE

Fill my chest with novocain
Knock me out so I sleep through the worst part
You know I understand the need for the pain
But I don’t think that’s enough

Don’t let this moment die in vain
Tie me down and show me all you hoped for
A tangled mess of limbs and lips in my brain
I need one to fill me up
I can feel you move like the ocean
Slide over me
Take me down over my head
Until we can be – I can’t breathe

Let me sleep here one more day
Hold me close so I can feel you breathing
I know it’s not right but it’s just a chance we have to take
I could be your best mistake

It’s gotta be love, gotta be something
Gotta be more to fill me up like this I know
This strange addiction has a kind of 
chemical connection in my soul
So it’s time to get over,
You know I’ve half a heart and half a mind and you just let go
