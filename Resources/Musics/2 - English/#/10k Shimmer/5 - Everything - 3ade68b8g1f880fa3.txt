EVERYTHING

Here we are again going through endless motions
Strange as it seems my friend I have been waiting for this moment
Could I ask you a question, I came here waiting for you
Peeling off you intentions like there's something you tought that I could do

Caught and I've waited long
I can see everything - everything
As long as I can wait here in this moment, I would do anything

Pave a road with goon intentions and I've waited here silently
Cross the waters of redemption, turning me 'round it rives me deep
But I can learn to swim again and I'll find my own way up
She wanted to be much more than this, but it never would be enough

Caught and I've waited long
I can see everything - everything
As long as I can wait here in this moment, 
I would do anything - anything.
Caught and I've waited long
I can do anything - anything.
Wait right here I'll be back in a moment
I can fix everything

Like I always do
Would it help if I left it up to you?
We've been down here so long and 
This struggle is more than I had planned on
All of these tracks in the sand
will wash away with a wave of your hand.

Here we go again, churning up all of this over
I'd break were I not to bend and in bending I surrender
You're eyes say it so much clearer now;  the words are drowned out by your stare
I came here to wring my soul out, 'cause that's what you wanted to hear
