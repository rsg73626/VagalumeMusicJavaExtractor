LAST NIGHT

Last night I dreamed that I was standing on solid ground For the first time in a long time
Every step was measured but I was relieved to be walking out in the sunshine
I forgot what its like to be broken
I conceed my soul to what you hold 'cause I'm feeling fine.

Everything falls.  Yeah that's what she said to me
Everything breaks and it leaves me broken
I heard you call and I'll follow it back one day
All on my own I will find my way back home

She was always looking out the window at the garden and I'm sweeping up the words to ask her why
Hours turn to days and I can feel the water slipping through my fingers no matter how hard I try
I  forgot what it's like to be open
I conceed my sould to what's unknown 'cause I'm feeling fine

It's been 3 years and you know I feel like death
'cause I've been running 'round in circles and I'm running out of breath
I've fallen out of line when I took that fall from grace and now I'm finding my way
