DEVOTION

So good to be with 
the people that know you.
It's good to hear 
the things that they say,
At times when you are with them.
So good to note 
my strength is growing from day to day, 
There's not a thing
I try to do without you

Troubled times of pain that come
I take them any old day.
You come and you wash them all away

Everywhere you sing in everything,
and I try by remembering
all the things that you said to me,
from within all you did for me.
Just one word.
