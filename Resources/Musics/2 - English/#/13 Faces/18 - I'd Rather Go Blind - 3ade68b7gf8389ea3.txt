I'D RATHER GO BLIND

something told me it was over
when I saw you and him talking 
something deep down in my soul said, cry boy
when I saw you and him out walking
I would rather, I would rather go blind girl
than to see you walk away from me child

so you see I love you so much 
I don't want to see you leave me baby 
most of all I just don't, I just don't want to be free
I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
of your kiss and your warm embrace child
when the reflection in the glass 
that I been held to my lips now baby 
revealed the tears I had on my face
I would rather, I would rather be blind child
than to see you walk away from me
baby, baby, baby I would rather go blind
than to see you walk away from me
