WATCH EM DROP

Trashing your name and your face
It aint no fucking thing
No one minds if they would up and die
Why so great, so lame short
Nothing of self of soul, of mind, of man
Giving it back, a bat, fuck integrity
Nothing made me sick, it's inside of me
When your dead
You'll see me pissing on your grave

You failed
You failed cause you suck

Driving me fast this is awsome
I think I'm gonna break
Nothing makes me sick, just stupidity
All your rage on me
Driving me fast this is awsome
I think I'm gonna break
Dripping blood is what your gonna see
Nothing left to save your sorry ass
When your dead
You'll see me pissing on your grave

You failed
You failed cause you suck

Striking your face
Never back down to an insect like you
I'm never backing down
Striking your face
I'll never back down
Cause I'm mad, so mad
So mad it makes me sick

You failed cause you suck

Trashing your name and your face
It ain't no fucking thing
No one minds if they would up and die
Why so great, so lame short
Nothing of self of soul, of mind, of man
Giving it back, a bat, fuck integrity
Nothing made me sick, it's inside of me
When your dead
You'll see me pissing on your grave

You failed, you failed
You failed cause you suck
