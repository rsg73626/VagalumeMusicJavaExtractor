JEALOUS GUY

I was dreaming of the past
and my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't want to hurt you
and I'm sorry I made you cry, no
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't care
I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure
you might not need me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside
I didn't want to hurt you
and I'm sorry I made you cry, oww
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't care
I'm just a jealous guy
