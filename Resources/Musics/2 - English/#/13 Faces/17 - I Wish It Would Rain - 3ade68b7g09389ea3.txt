I WISH IT WOULD RAIN

sunshine, blueskies please go away
my girl has found another and gone away
with her went my future my life is filled with gloom
so day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you This might sound strange 
but I wish it would rain
caused so badly that i wanna go outside
but everyone knows that a man ain't suppose to cry
listen I got to cry cause cry'n loses the pain
because this hurt I feel inside words could never explain
I just wish it would rain 
let it rain
rain rain rain
let it rain, let it rain
day in day out my tears stay in phase 
pressed against the window pane
my eyes such a disguised 
thats the believe of rain 
cause rain drops behind my tear drops
and know one will ever know
that i'm cry'n,cry'n when I go outside
to the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
ohhh i wish it would rain
let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
let it rain
I WISH IT WOULD RAIN
