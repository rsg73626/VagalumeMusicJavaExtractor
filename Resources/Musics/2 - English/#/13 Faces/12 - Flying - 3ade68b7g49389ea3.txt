FLYING

I'm flying 
across the ocean
and I'm soaring 
back home
to the place I was born 
and probably raised.
And I'm flying 
across the mountains and valleys,
back home to the one that I love so happily.

Can ya' blame me for feeling homesick
'cause I've been away such a very long long time 
I served a while in the county jail 
five years for being hungry tired and poor

On and on 
yes I will follow 
with your buttons and bows.
