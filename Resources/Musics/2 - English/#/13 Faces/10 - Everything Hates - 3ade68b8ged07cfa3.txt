EVERYTHING HATES

Damage
Clearing away
Nothing you save breaks the skin
Just another fucking rash
Crawling away
Think I can drown
Tried the door, but we'll never leave
Christ, how will we grow
Hear all alone
Don't they know that their blocking me in
Killing the way
Nothing of self
This disease is just bringing me down

Everything Hates

Damage
No one to thank
Nothing to break
Don't you see that your making me sick
Nothing to play
No one can see
Just how low that you're bringing me
Shit
Here on your own
Nothing to praise
Knowing away at knees
Breaking your fist
Breaking your bones
Try the door but they never leave
