NOTHINGFACE

Nothingface is tortured agonized, say
Nothingface, Nothingface
Is death commanding death
Nothingface, Nothingface
Is squeezed, chokes, and suffocates
Nothingface, Nothingface
Is bleeds, cries, and screams no more

Everytime I see your face
I feel discrace
Longing for your torment
Waiting for your death

Nothingface, Nothingface
Is dismembered torso, say
Nothingface, Nothingface
Is twists, snaps, and breaks your neck
Nothingface, Nothingface
Is rape, molesting face
Nothingface, Nothingface
Is my sick, perverted side

Everytime I see your face
I feel discrace
Longing for your torment
Waiting for your death

Bruise, break, kill, crush
