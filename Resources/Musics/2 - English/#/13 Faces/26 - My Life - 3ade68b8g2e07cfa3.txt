MY LIFE

The reach
Through the blood
This is all I ever want to know
Hopeless, helpless, shameless, completely underrated
Signified life
With a forked tongue
Destitute, a vagrant, absent teen
Make me, shape me, break me
You'll never fucking change me

I don't care, hate me
This is my life
And you'll never fucking change me

So I lost, so I failed
My life, my choice, my road
Completely misdirected
So I'm not rich
So I might puke
Social bonds that have no ties to me
Bogus, vicious, valiant
This is this cross that I bear

I don't care
Hate me
This is my life
And you'll never fucking change me
