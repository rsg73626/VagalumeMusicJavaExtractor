NOTHING LIKE YOU

Me, you can't stop me
Cause I'm nothing like you

You're just a minor obsruction of fear and dismay
I'm stuck in this prison that you call a home
You won't even listen you never did care
For someone who raised me you weren't even there
It's all in the past. I cannot forgive
There's something I lost
It's not in my head, as someone who knows
As someone who's better I may have your blood
It don't even matter

Me, you can't stop me
Cause I'm nothing like you

What is the point if you dont understand?

I'm just biding my time as I sit through this shit
Stop saying your sorry I still won't forget
It's all in this house and how you have lived
In 25 years, I still hope your dead
Neglected your oldest day after day
Protected my sibling you threw me away
I still have my drive, It will not detain
Your blood is in my veins
It dont even matter

Me, you can't stop me
Cause I'm nothing like you

What is the point if you don't understand?
