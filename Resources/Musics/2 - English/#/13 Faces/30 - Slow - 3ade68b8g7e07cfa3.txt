SLOW

Procreation
That's where my life had died
It's like I'm never wanted
Why me, why me, why is it always me

Institution
Thats where my childhood died
It's like they love to hate me
Make it stop, make it stop, God, make it stop

I'd die for another life

Patience is my new best friend
I never forgot you
I'm planning my vengence

Slow

Deconstruction
That's where my concience died
You see I need them tortured
Make 'em bleed, make 'em bleed, God, make 'em bleed

Retribution
That's where my anger lies
You see I've waited so long
Here I come, Here I come, Here I fucking come
