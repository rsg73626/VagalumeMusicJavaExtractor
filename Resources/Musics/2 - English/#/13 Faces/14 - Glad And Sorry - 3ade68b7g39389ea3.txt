GLAD AND SORRY

thank you kindly for thinking of me
if I'm not smiling I'm just thinking

glad and sorry, happy or sad
when all is done and spoken
you're up or I'm down

can you show me a dream
can you show me one that's better than mine
can you stand it in the cold light of day
neither can I

can you show me a dream
can you show me one that's better than mine
can you stand it in the cold light of day
neither can I
