MARCH

Dawned in my head just the other day getting high
What would I do, who would I kill
Seeing defeat dripping down from the arabplane
Blow away, nothing to see
Alah to praise, Alah can't see
Set me down, flip the page and everything
Allied defense, allied defense
No one's faith shall break or make me safe

March

Dawned in my head just the other day getting high
What would I do, who would I kill
Seeing your fate, jumping down on the t.v.
Nothing to blame, nothing to see
Terror ain't the way, nothing to save
Just a downfall faith of plague and dirt
Allied defense, allied defense
So don't bitch
You should have made me safe

March, throw your weight at me
March, kill your love for me
March, tear away for me
March, show your love for me
March, kill your wife for me
March, kill your love for me
March, throw your hate at me
March, kill your wife fro me
March, tear your love for me
March, clear the way for me
March, tear your love for me
March, throw your hate at me
