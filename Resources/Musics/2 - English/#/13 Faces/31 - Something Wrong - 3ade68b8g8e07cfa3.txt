SOMETHING WRONG

Gross out, I'm scarred
I wanna rape and sodomize a beauty queen
Stare, rage, unclean
Breath your last breath for me.

This feels so right
There's something wrong with me
This feels so good
There's something wrong with me

I'm not insane
I just found my lot in life
Watching you cry is my favorite part of this
Drone, scab, still birth
I love that scream as I force myself inside of you
Cold, set, I'm done
Take a good look at me

This feels so right
There's something wrong with me
This feels so good
There's something wrong with me
