CINDY INCIDENTALLY

Oh Cindy ain't you noticed that several of your friends have moved on
And the street outside is just a little too quiet
And your local papers (the Berkshire and Windsor annoyance)
run out of news
I'm not persuading you or disengaging you
But Cindy you and me we've got to move
Can you refuse, no time to lose
We'll hit the high road early this morning
So don't be late, don't hesitate
This dream can pass just as fast as lightning
And Cindy and incidentally baby ain't putting you on
Can you refuse, no time to lose
We'll hit the high raod early this morning
So don't be late, don't hesitate
This dream can pass just as fast as lightning
Oh Cindy don't you worry 'cause between us we can make it through
There ain't nothing no no nothing in the world I can do without you
So Cindy get your coat on leave the rent with the gent in the penthouse
Turn your music so loud let's attract a big crowd
We'll drink a round to this town and bid goodbye
