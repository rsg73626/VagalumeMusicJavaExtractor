IT'S ALL OVER NOW

baby used to stay out all night long
she made me weep, you know she done me wrong
she held my eyes open and that's no lie
tables turned and now it's her turn to cry
because I used to love her but it's all over now 
because I used to love her but it's all over now
well I used to wake the morning get my breakfast in bed
when I got worried she'd ease my aching head
but now she's here and there with every single man in town
still try to take me for that same old brand
because I used to love her but it's all over now
because I used to love her but it's all over now
she used to run around with every single man in town
spent all my money playing her fast game
she used to put me down, it was a pity how I cried
but the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry
because I used to love her but it's all over now
because I used to love her but it's all over now
because I used to love her but it's all over now
IT'S ALL OVER NOW
