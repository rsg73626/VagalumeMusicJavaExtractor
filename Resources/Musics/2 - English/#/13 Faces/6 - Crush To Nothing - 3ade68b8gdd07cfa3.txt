CRUSH TO NOTHING

Soaked in sweat
Afraid from my hands
Maintain control
Take this life from me

Throwing everything that you've got
It's like you're kidding me
A person grown like yourself
It's like you've soiled your face
Everything hates, you baby
Ever think you've been had
Your world's a close minded joke
It's like you're all alone

Dropping, and it weighs a ton
Everything you can convey
It's like you're crawling to me
It's soft and you'd call if fake
Everything that you burn
Everything that you can convey
Your words are made up fact
Everything's crumbling down

Talking shit, you confess all this shit
You'd better die and convert
Because you know your part
Don't play dead sentiments
Don't lie, show something that you
You'll never know of me
Honor, courage, solace, pride, rage

Lay on me

So vague, you've been hit
Never heard the dead say no
Bone, break, crumbling, crashing
Burning, faster, stronger
CRUSH TO NOTHING

Soaked in sweat
Afraid from my hands
Maintain control
Take this life from me

Throwing everything that you've got
It's like you're kidding me
A person grown like yourself
It's like you've soiled your face
Everything hates, you baby
Ever think you've been had
Your world's a close minded joke
It's like you're all alone

Dropping, and it weighs a ton
Everything you can convey
It's like you're crawling to me
It's soft and you'd call if fake
Everything that you burn
Everything that you can convey
Your words are made up fact
Everything's crumbling down

Talking shit, you confess all this shit
You'd better die and convert
Because you know your part
Don't play dead sentiments
Don't lie, show something that you
