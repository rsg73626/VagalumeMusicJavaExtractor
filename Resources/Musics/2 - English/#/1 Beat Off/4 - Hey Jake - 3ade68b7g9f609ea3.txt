HEY JAKE

hey jake
you're fat and i hate your ways
you talk shit but not to my face
you are just another fool
trying too hard to be cool
hey jake hey jake hey jake your fat and i hate you
can't think for yourself
you have to rely
rely on someone else
someone to tell you what to do
someone you consider more punk than you
hey jake hey jake hey jake your fat and i hate you
