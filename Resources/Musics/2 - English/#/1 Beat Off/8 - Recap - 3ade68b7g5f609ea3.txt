RECAP

once again i think society's corrupt and this world is turning to shit
it seems that everyone, all they ever want to do is fit
in
can't they see that something wrong?
i wonder if they even notice
once again i think my best friend is moronic and he doesn't even understand
why doesn't he just open up his eyes and try to be a real friend
won't let this world drag me down
i know i've been pushed around
by the people who think they control
and of course they've yet to show me how
they consider this right
and the people in the high position
who rule the world with their decisions
now i hope they see what they've done
