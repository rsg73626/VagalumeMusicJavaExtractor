EX MISS

Everything that could have went wrong, went wrong this year
Nothing recently has made me want to stand up and cheer
Everything you haven't said has finally come back to you

Now is not the time, now is not the time
I know you never liked any gifts I gave to you

This holiday is overrated
It turned out the way I expected
This holiday is one to forget
Another year, this time I'll regret that 
I spent too much time
And money on you.

Why do I only remember the bad times we had?
I guess everything we do (everything we do) does reflect
Everything you wish you said, has finally come back to you

Now is not the time, now is not the time
I know you never liked any gifts I gave to you

This holiday is overrated
It turned out the way I expected
This holiday is one to forget
Another year, this time I'll regret that 
I spent too much time
And money on you.

This holiday is overrated
It turned out the way I expected
This holiday is one to forget
Another year, another year
This holiday is overrated
It turned out the way I expected
This holiday is one to forget
Another year, another year

I hope you spend it alone.
