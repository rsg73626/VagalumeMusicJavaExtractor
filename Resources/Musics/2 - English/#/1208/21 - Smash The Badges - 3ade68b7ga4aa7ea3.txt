SMASH THE BADGES

We've heard you talk about us 
We know you could live without us 
We know authority would rather fight than unite 
We know our rights and we have none 
But that's gonna change tonight 
You need to learn that we're not looking down 
We see eye to eye 

[Chorus:] 
So now I say, we're gonna smash the badge 
Until we get our way, don't put it off 
Put them away [2x] 

Don't want to play your game 
Intimidation, fear and shame 
Take away the badge 
And you're a citizen just the same 
There's a time for everything 
And you've come at the wrong time lookin for me 
How can you say you know what's right, as you lie 

[Chorus 2x] 

There's been too many days and nights 
Being bored with nothin to do 
We're gonna tear it down tonight 
This one's from us to you 
We're gonna take back what you took away 
You're gonna take back what you had to say 
And you will wish that this was yesterday 
Don't need the games you play 
We're gonna take, we're gonna break 
Leave us alone, or we'll break your face 

[Chorus 2x]
