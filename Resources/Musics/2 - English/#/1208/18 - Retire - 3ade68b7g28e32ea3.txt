RETIRE

You watch and know
Unspoken not forgotten
As one we've grown

And sometimes soft,
So soft could penetrate a rock
You know we
Got to make it
See to it, straight through it
Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it
used to be
(Will you still know me when I'm gone)
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)

And what's in store
Get into character for
Allegiance sworn

A sufface aquisition
Maybe an allusion, together still
Our selfish route together
Not taken by another
No shoes to fill
The steps that we're taken are not to be mistaken and
yah there's fear
but waken to get up to find maybe it's better
to spin the gear
Got to make it, see to it, straight through it
Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it
used to be
(Will you still hate me when I'm gone)
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)
The word on the street is strong, speaks for
itself, belongs to no one else
(WIll you still know me when I'm gone)
And I'm calling on all of you, we've paid our dues
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)
