OUTSIDE LOOKING IN

Somebody told him that their way was the right way
He never took a chance, her never had a
chance
Cause he was force fed he had to live his
death sentence
See, he was a new face with a nice smile
He got sucked in got spit out
He was the winner by the standars of gold-digger
A success story in six figures
Outside looking in
It was wasted life on the dream
Outside looking in
He was wasted
Turn your back to the world
So then he grew old, he thought he grew wise
He thought he'd know a bad seed in swarm of flies
They couldn't wait to consider him family
Take what they could get and keep walkin'
And on his death bed surrounded by his friends
He saw the faces and no substance, let go
With a smile of serenity, he needed change for enternity
On the outside looking in
It was wasted life on a dream
On the outside looking in
He should of seen their dream as a sin
On the outside looking in
It was wasted life on the dream
On the outside looking in
He was wasted
Turn you back on the world
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know
It's what he didn't know (on the outside looking in)
It's what he didn't know (it was wasted life on a dream)
It's what he didn't know (on the outside looking in)
It's what he didn't know (he was wasted)
Turn your back on the world
