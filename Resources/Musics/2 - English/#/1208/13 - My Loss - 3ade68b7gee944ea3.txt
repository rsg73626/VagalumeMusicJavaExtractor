MY LOSS

Watching as you drive away
Speed away so fast
Knowing something's different now
That ending was our last
Nothing describes the emptiness filled inside
Take me to that place
Where everything's fine
And not a worry in mind
Sweet into the taste

This is my loss (my loss)
I didn't want you to do it again
To be with you feels like the right thing
This is my loss (my loss)
I didn't want you to try to pretend
That nothing's changed for all that you bring
For all that you bring

Simple is so complex now
So I understand
That I never thought that happy could be distraught
Help me if you can

This is my loss (my loss)
I didn't want you to do it again
To be with you feels like the right thing
This is my loss (my loss)
I didn't want you to try to pretend
That nothing's changed for all that you bring

Well I know I'm wrong
And you know I'm here
I don't want to let you disapear
What am I worth when your eyes were
Begging me in fear
I only want to see you again
And repair the wounds that brought me in
I don't want to think it won't happen again

This is my loss (my loss)
I didn't want you to do it again
To be with you feels like the right thing
This is my loss (my loss)
I didn't want you to try to pretend
That nothing's changed for all that you bring
For all that you bring

For all that you bring
For all you bring
