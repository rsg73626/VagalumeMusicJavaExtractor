LIGHTSHOW

Wish I could stay but I gotta run
I got some miles to go and no destination
And like you've never seen, my light is always green
The ice is melting and the bitch ain't helping
I sink the eight-ball from the cue, before you
know I'm through
With blurred validity I can see you in me
Put in my hand a hundred proof I'm bad
Is this the same wine that Christ permits to dine with
Can't part with
A light show, a shadow, through these eyes
everything looks too clean
I make it to brake it
From the bottom the top will always spit you out
Spit you out
My thoughts aren't set in stone and I'm committed
to go where few have
ever roames, and through the klgiht show I witness
the unknown
Put in my hand a hundred proof I'm bad
Is this the smae wint that Christ permits to dine with
Can't part with
A light show, a shadows, through these eyes
everything looks too clean
I make it to brake it
From the bottom the top will always spit you out
I've been drinking to my health
Gotta get off me, get away from me
I've been sinking to my hell
Gotta get off me, get away from me,
I've been living for myself
It's not me
It's not me
It's not me
It's not me
