EVERYDAY

Deep inside my brain, there's a place I could live forever 
Memories safe within a shelter 
It's what I have, it's what I save 
And beyond that place, there are names that I can't remember 
Like the warmest day in September 
A written list that doesn't exist 

If I could take it back, live a day in the past 
I would do it every hour 
Now it's just a fact, that we don't want to look back 
And I wish that something mattered 

[Chorus:] 
Every day is the same in a new crowd 
Every voice is a whisper that seems loud 
I hear you callin my name 
But your voice is the same 
Everyday 

Some will go down, my ship still floats 
To it I know I'm bound 
Wishing that tomorrow was gone and 
Where is a place, that I can relate 
And it's been so long, all the month's have turned into years now 
And the clock won't stop for me so 
I gotta move on and try to belong 

If I could take it back, live a day in the past 
I would do it every hour 
Now it's just a fact, that we don't want to look back 
And I wish that something mattered 

[Chorus] 

Color in rain is never the same 
Color in rain is never the same 

[Chorus 2x]
