ERASE 'EM ALL

Building the walls around it
Created self with nothing much
Without a cost to find it
Feeling avoid and losing touch
The borrowed taste his novelty
Could be a product of another's humility
Don't worry your loss wil be his gain
He wouldn't hesitate to turn his back on you
And it might be true
Erase 'em all - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall befoer you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all
The warning's out it's gonna come to an end and I
Hate to see him label me as a friend tonight
Never question my intentions without the right
Showing me another way to turn his back on you
And it might be you
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all, Erase 'em all, Erase 'am all,
Erase 'em all
Erase 'em all, Erase 'em all, Erase 'am all,
Erase 'em all
You wanna stay you'd better run
When I catch up you better have a gun
I'm so wound up from playin' dumb
This time it's real and real isn't fun
You never saw this side before
Don't test the water for what's in store
I drew the line and I learned a rule
What's good for me isn't good for you
Erase 'em all
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all
