TIME TO REMEMBER

[Chorus:] 
I want to take time to remember 
Cuz I always make time to forget 
When it usually ends in disaster 
I know its not over yet (its not over yet) 

Right here 
I face the crowd alone 
With nothing 
And I know I’m on my own 
Even if I wanna get high today 
I’m living in my head 
And it’ll be okay 
I know I can’t 
I care enough to say 

[Chorus] 

It’s finished 
Since I saw through open eyes 
Without you 
I wasn’t strong 
I never quite 
Even if I wanna get high today 
I’m living in my head 
And it’ll be okay 
I know I can’t 
I care enough to say 

[Chorus] 

stop the track 
to look back 
see how much has changed 

[Chorus] 

stop my track 
to look back 
see how much has changed 

(ahhhhhh) 
see how much has changed [x3]
