SCARED AWAY

Somebody once said
Stop when the light turns red
I know the story
But I don't want the glory
Cause when you're shot down
You're gonna hit ground
But they don't feel it
No they won't heal it
I've given everything
I've played the name game
I sent my get well cards
And never got an answer
Don't want my money back
These cards are not stacked
And I don't need it
I won't believe it this time
I won't believe it this time
No I don't need it
I won't believe it
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shaking under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
Can I get close enough
So you can hold me up
And tell me over and over
I went bad again
I'll tell you one thing
Without a promise ring
That I don't need it
I won't believe it
When it's down to this
I get oblivious
I see you looking
But you don't wanna see a thing
Being so scared
Can't get you anywhere
And I don't need it
I won't believe it this time
I won't believe it this time
No I don't need it
I won't believe it
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
See what's wrong see what's wrong
See what's wrong with me, what's wrong with me
Me looking at you, you looking away
And I'm wondering how the one I know had changed
Me reaching to touch someone
But you're gone, tired now
Scared away somehow
Scared away somehow
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong
