SPEAK EASY

follow me
I'll show you what i see
some say were waste of space
but i think we've found our place
they're so concerned
about the way we live
struggle to make a buck
they point the finger at us
a lot has changed today
there is no shame
whose gonna speak the truth
as television lies to you
and those of us who knows whats going on
hear you generalize
we try to rationalize
dont fucking criticize us
cause when the lights are low in your head
that's when we'll shine on you
and when you believe things cant get worse
that when we'll see you through
but we wont be there to use you
burned your proof
if you cant speak easy
than your going to fall right through
remember me when nobody hears you scream
they'll look you in the eye
but wont care if you die
cause were living in such a fucking mess
we trash the ones we and say
fuck all the rest
it's gonna make you sick
cause when the lights are low
in your head that's when we'll shine on you
and when you believe things cant get worse
dont you worry about where your going
in the end were going to find out a better way
I'll remain in the shadows
as you wither in the spotlight
i can see the poison in your blood now
your exposed and its not a surprise
that there is nothing beneath the veil
follow me
I'll show you what i see
follow me follow me
we'll find a better way
follow me
