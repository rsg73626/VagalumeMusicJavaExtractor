THE SAINT

I am me as only I can be
You push me from the start
A planned device on how to live my life
I try to play the part

Always wanted something more for me
I was born given a path
Never would I make the same mistakes
Nothing that will hold me back

Do you really want to make it better?
Do you really want to be the saint?
Are you satisfied?
Did you lose your pride?
(You're not) you’re not to blame

Never thought there might be more to me
Doors were locked, needed a key
I finally opened my eyes; saw what had passed me by
Wasn’t where I wanted to be

Do you really want to make it better?
Do you really want to be the saint?
Are you satisfied?
Did you lose your pride?
(You're not) you’re not to blame

Do you really want to make it better?
Do you really want to be the saint?
Are you satisfied?
Did you lose your pride?
(You're not) you’re not to blame

To blame
To blame
To blame
To blame
