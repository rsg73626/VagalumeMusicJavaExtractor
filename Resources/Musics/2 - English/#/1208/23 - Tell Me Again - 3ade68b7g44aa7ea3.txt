TELL ME AGAIN

Looking at you 
And all that we’ve been through 
I just can’t forget 
What’s going through your head? 
So I read what you left on the bed 
Different signs, haven’t said 
It’s easier to 
Try to kill my pain, 
My pain, I hate 
It’s a world affair 
So then I can’t explain 
To you, because the truth 
Is something you can’t take 

*Tell me again 
What’s wrong with me? 
Why won’t you depend on me now? 
Just let it happen again 
Tell me again 
What’s wrong? 
That I just don’t feel the need to belong 
This is no means to an end 
I’m not what you see, nooo 

Been with a few 
Oh but not quite like you 
And you’re crazy like me 
What more can I ask for 
So you need more 
Everybody gets bored 
I like all that I see 
It’s easier to 
Try to kill my pain, 
My pain, I hate 
It’s a world affair 
So then I can’t explain 
To you, because the truth 
Is something you can’t take 

[Chorus] 

I’ll burn you 
And turn you 
In you all 
The others you had left 
Alone with 
No one is such a shame 
You just don’t know me yet 
And now I think so much about me and you 
I couldn’t hurt you now 
I never got to get up 
I promise you 

[Chorus] 

Cuz I’m not what you see 
I won’t try to be nooo
