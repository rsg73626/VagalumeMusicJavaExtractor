LIES THAT LIE

Lies that lie eyes that cry baby
Try and try to understand maybe
Skies were meant to fall on me
Just like people will be free
Living lies and takin' sides daily
Dimmer minds and duller times maybe
Life is just a fight to survive
Only dreams can make me feel more alive
Despising agonizing every word
It's so absured to me
I guess it's better to observe
Another problem but who said I'm right
I don't wanna fight it
I gotta fight it
Get in line, think of a better one baby
Written rhymes to keep a clearer mind, hey hey
You can take it out on me
Let's just see what you can do for me
Lies that lie and eyes that cry baby
Try and try to understand maybe
Who ever thought of this?
The good times are times I've missed - Lies that lie
Don't wanna swing to miss
I'm still reading down my list - Lies that lie
Despising agonizing every word
It's so absured to me
I guess it's better to observe
Another problem but who said I'm right
Don't wanna fight it
I gotta fight it
Before I go
Don't wanna fight it
I gotta fight it
Before I go
Don't wanna fight it
I gotta fight it
Before I go
Lies that lie, lies that lie, lies that lie, lies that lie
Lies that lie, lies that lie, lies that lie, lies that lie
