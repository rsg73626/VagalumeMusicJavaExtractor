FROM BELOW

It was the day the sky fell on me, 
I know I've changed since you last saw me, 
So sick of hearing that I'm not right, 
Could've been better, I'm tired and I don't want to fight. 
Because the guilt that builds up inside, 
Fills me with fear that is just too hard to hide, 
Nothings the same as it used to be, 
It's getting harder each day to be me. 

From below I know I can grow, 
And stay out of your sight, 
From below I know I am low, 
Hidden from the daylight, 
Within reach but never mine to keep. 

It took so long before I could face, 
How it was wrong it was hard to trace, 
Most of my like I lived to be, 
Part of a world so blind, I was lucky to see, 
That my vision was blurred with lies, 
Nobody understood, no one who could confide, 
Nothing's the same as it used to be, 
It's getting harder each day to be me. 

From below I know I can grow, 
And stay out of your sight, 
From below I know I am low, 
Hidden from the daylight, 
Within reach but never mine to keep. 

If it was up to me, I'd look at all I could be, 
So many wants and needs, I guess I'll try to be me. 

From below I know I can grow, 
And stay out of your sight, 
From below I know I am low, 
Hidden from the daylight, 
From below I know I can grow, 
And stay out of your sight, 
From below I know I am low, 
Hidden from the daylight, 
Yeah, Yeah.
