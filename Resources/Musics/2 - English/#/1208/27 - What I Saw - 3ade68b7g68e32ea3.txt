WHAT I SAW

Yesterdays winter brought a blizzard to my door she said dont worry anymore whatever held you back is forever in the past wont let my youth go by to fast if what we love makes us who we are then your worth every beat of my heart if i could give you anything
I'd give you the scene in my sleep what i saw i might be stuck here but
I've got something to say but more of you makes me feeel ok yesterdays winter said that i might never die but i saw the sunrise and i knew why if what we love makes us who we are then your worth every beat of my heart if i could give you anything i'd give you the scene in my sleep what
I saw soon i will know when to get to the end and i could be better at being me again yesterdays winter she sad the world will never die but i saw the night fall and i knew why if what we love makes us who we are then your worth every beat of my heart if i could give you anything i'd give you the scene in my sleep what i saw what i saw what i saw
