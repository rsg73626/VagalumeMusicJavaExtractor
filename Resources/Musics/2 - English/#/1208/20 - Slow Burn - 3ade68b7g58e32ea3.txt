SLOW BURN

I've got a name for a certain quarantine her name is slowburn she makes me feel real mean when i ask why she says i'm caught in a lie she's got a bad disguise i ask a question never got a reaction and caught a glimpse subtle distraction instinctive stomach pain i lie in bed awake again this time its my revenge
I wanna be you already beaten when you are bound i'm free (dying under me)
I' like to hold you so close you know i'm there (there is no refuge (rage you cant refuse) slowburn
