JUST ANYONE

Every face sing we had to happen, every
face is you
Every smile that I force on someone sends me
to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because, I need more
time to clear the fuzz
Take me back twenty first street
Troubles times that I find myself in, double
without you
Such a lose that I try to replace sends me
to the edge
Living breaks I take because, I need more
time to get a buzz
Take me back twenty first street
I think I'm losin', losin' my mind
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel - Just anyone
All the times that we tried to make it
Now those days are through
All the times we were forced to fake it send
me to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because, I need more
time to clear the fuzz
Take me back twenty first street
I think I'm losin', losin' my mind
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel - Just anyone
Spending hours trting to find myself-
Redemption, wrong direction
No more power to control my - Isolation no solution
Every voice that I know is not the same
Every word taht I read calls out your name
So many days looking for you but in vein
A losin' game and I'm to blame
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel
Just anyone - Just anyone means that I can't
afford to face the facts
Just anyone - Just anyone means that I can't
afford to be just anyone
