FALL APART

Inside a story's been
A pad-lock keeps me in
Emotions run low
If you've come for a show
I'm from the world today
Insane as some might say
Got nothing to show
If you've come just to send me away

I wasn't asking for it
And I tried to ignore it
I've got one problem
I fall apart for you
(I'm further from the truth)
A living disaster, I die for my master
It's true (I'm stuck and can't get loose)
Another example of losing my handle on you

I'm safe 'cause no one sees
What has become of me
Emotions run low
As my sickness just grows
They try to hold me down
When you cannot be found
Got nothing to show
If you've come just to turn off the sound

I wasn't asking for it
And I tried to ignore it
I've got one problem
I fall apart for you
(I'm further from the truth)
A living disaster, I die for my master
It's true (I'm stuck and can't get loose)
Another example of losing my handle on you

Well I fall asleep tonight
Don't wanna lose the fight
And I wanna get it right
This time it's not for you
Well I fall asleep tonight
Don't wanna lose the fight
And I wanna get it right
This time it's just for me

I did, I hurt myself for you
It's always here and makes me feel the mood
But the more I do for you
The less I can do for myself
These eyes are meant to be alone
We know nothing is set in stone
I've got one problem

I fall apart for you
(I'm further from the truth)
A living disaster, I die for my master
It's true (I'm stuck and can't get loose)
Another example of losing my handle on you
I fall apart for you
(I'm further from the truth)
A living disaster, I die for my master
It's true (I'm stuck and can't get loose)
Another example of losing my handle on you

My handle on you....
