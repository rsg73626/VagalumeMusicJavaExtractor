LOST AND FOUND

You know the question, find the answer
Stirring deep within your mind
Don't Have to Promise, You have a reason
For what it is you need to find
I was searching, until I found it
And I saw it in you
It seems so real, but I can feel me
Getting closer to you

If clocks could stop, time wouldn't waste
And I could tell you once more
That we are running, without eachother
There's not much to live for
I tried to find, the side you hide,
The side that pushes me away,
You're standing close so, I can tell you
That I wish you would stay

I wouldn't know myself
I'm lost without you here
If you could see my side

I will wait for you, no matter what you do
Cause you're a part of me now
We will see this through
Go on to something new
We were lost but now we're found

As days go by, you're fading faster
Looking for something new
It's hard to notice, you're looking past me
When I'm right within your view

I wouldn't know myself
I'm lost without you here
If you could see my side

I will wait for you, no matter what you do
Cause you're a part of me now
We will see this through
Go on to something new
We were lost but now we're found

It's been a bumpy road
I'll try to carry your load
I'll try to understand
Your fate is in your hands
If you could see my side

I wouldn't know myself
I'm lost without you here
If you could see my side

I will wait for you no matter what you do
Cause you're a part of me now
We will see this through
Go on to something new
We were lost but now we're found

We were lost and now we're found
