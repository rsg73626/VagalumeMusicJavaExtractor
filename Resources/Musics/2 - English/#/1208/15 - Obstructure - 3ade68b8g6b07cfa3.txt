OBSTRUCTURE

The pet he found at the bar
the status of a new car with it
big money made a new job
To make him feel a less slob of it
new standards changed the ego
the villain now a hero
looks at life, and takes a bite
a piece of paper makes him proud
the silence of success has gotta seem so loud
his future in a uniform
he's just another number in the eye of the storm
obstructure to late
Is a piece he cannot pay - the cost of pride
and still he hides dies inside - alone he sheds a tear
for the memories of before from it
a tribute to the good of the lord
the bible is the way to forget
New standards changed the ego
the villain now a hero
looks at life, it's flee or fight
Its nervous laughter business now
it used to be a trip to circle - seven without
The plan for number one to rise
the world he lives in is a price tag lie
obstructure to late
Is a piece he cannot pay - the cost of pride
and still he hides inside - dies inside
(Have you ever felt alone?)
(Have you ever felt alone in the crowd?)
You keep your mouth shut
But inside you scream out loud
stay real to yourself, be afraid of yourself
Find a heaven in hell
(Have you ever felt alone?)
Are you so together that you unwound?
You got a pulse so loud you cant hear a sound
Of them talking to you, trying to see though you
And you don't know what to do
obstructure to late
Is a piece he cannot pay - the cost of pride
and still he hides inside - dies inside
(can't be alone, he can't)
Dies inside
(can't be alone, he can't)
Dies inside
(can't be alone, he can't)
Dies inside
(can't be alone)
