TURN OF THE SCREW

Do you feel the turn of the screw? 
Pushing harder, breaking through 
It's better than you ever knew 
Now it gets to take care of you 
I won't go and tell it 
Don't bet you're due 
It swings enough to know the truth 
It even left you black and blue 
Never stop when there's nothing left to do 

The turn of the screw, the turn of the screw 
The thing you said you'd never do 
The turn of the screw, the turn of the screw 
There's no backing out once you've turned the screw 

You never thought what they say could be 
One night alone and you would see 
I think you'll take back all those doubts 
Now you know what the talk was all about 

The turn of the screw, the turn of the screw 
The thing you said you'd never do 
The turn of the screw, the turn of the screw 
There's no backing out once you've turned the screw 

Turn, Turn, Turn it around 
Turn, Turn, Turn it here on the ground 
Turn, Turn, Turn it around 
Turn, Turn, Turn it here on the ground 

The turn of the screw, the turn of the screw 
The thing you said you'd never do 
The turn of the screw, the turn of the screw 
There's no backing out once you've turned the screw 

The Turn of the Screw 
The Turn of the Screw 
The Turn of the Screw 
The Turn of the Screw
