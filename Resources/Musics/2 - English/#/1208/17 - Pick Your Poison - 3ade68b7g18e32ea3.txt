PICK YOUR POISON

Running from yourself like you're stranded
And now you're exactly where
You never thought you would be
In the dark without a light to guide you
What once was a breath
Is now a gasp to survive

You left so much behind
So many questions unanswered
The other side
The crash to the burn
The fingers that picket
For your solid satisfaction
Belong to the hands
Wrapped around your neck so tight

[Chorus]
You live today, Without a care
Tomorrow will come and I'll still be here
I gave myself to you and you left me with lies
And there will come a time when you have so much
But there's so little that you can touch
And still I consider you a friend

For every temporary sucker
That's in place
That you need
Is another cry
For you to return
You've been there
You've been square
But nothing in between
Now it's time to find those
Who are looking for you tonight

[Chorus]

It's hard to accept
But there's people that don't care
In a world so cold
And they seem unfair
But you've got to realise
You have a purpose
And it's not through your nose
That you can see the light
When I was scared
You picked me up
You told me never to forget
That I'll be there by your side
So here I am
We've gone too far
And it's been a long time
Since we've been at peace
We followed a part
But I still know
That behind the mask
Is a familiar face
It's you

[Chorus]
