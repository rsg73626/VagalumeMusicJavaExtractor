HURTS TO KNOW

You're always talkin' about everyone,
Of all their problems,
And what they have done,
You think they listen to you,
You're so easy to see through,
The big decision, is who to impress,
Hiding the fact that,
Your life is a mess,
You lie to yourself and deny,
For fear of what's inside.

Not a reason to believe in,
And it hurts to know,
That it's all show,
You're more important than we could know,
For what you've got in mind,
Who could ever be with your time,
It hurts to know.

Every possesion that you'll ever need,
All of your vision's been blinded by greed,
No one can offer enough,
You say you've had it rough,
Asking me favore and not an apology,
For sick intentions,
That people don't want to see,
Only lookin for more,
What are you living for.

Not a reason to believe in,
It hurts to know,
That it's all show,
You're more important than we could know,
For what you've got in mind,
Who could ever be with your time,
It hurts to know,
That it's all show,
You're more important than we could know,
For what you've got in mind,
Who could ever be with your time,
Let it go.

It's been so long since you admitted you're wrong,
Did you forget that you're human,
But the need to belong just keeps on bringing you back,
Are you avoiding the fact,
That I won't be coming home?

And it hurts to know,
That it's all show,
You're more important than we could know,
For what you've got in mind,
Who could ever be with your time,
It hurts to know.
Not a reason to believe in,
And it hurts to know,
That it's all show,
You're more important than we could know,
For what you've got in mind,
Who could ever be with your time,
It hurts to know.
It hurts to know.
