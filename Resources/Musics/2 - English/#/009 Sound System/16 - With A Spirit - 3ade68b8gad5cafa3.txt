WITH A SPIRIT

You can be
Whatever you want
When you're high
Walk slowly
With a spirit by your side
(Oh baby)
Don't fear if you lose your mind
Say how you doin' boy I'm feelin' fine

...when somethin' carries me away... 
hey hey hey hey

Don't think
Just take a ride
Don't believe
That Jesus lied
To keep us all so satisfied
With a sale
You should know baby

Don't feel
The thorny nights
Never ask
For holy rites
Don't ya think
That god has died
This time

And don't stop
Takin' these drugs cuz' they
Got you flyin' forgettin' yesterday
Maybe it's crazy but keep gettin' stoned while you can
Baby in the lord's hands

Don't say
You know what's right

Don't take
Those alibis
Don't hate
The other side
When they're right
Sure they are baby

Don't wave
Your flag up high
Don't praise
Your concubines
Did you just
Fall for lies
This time
