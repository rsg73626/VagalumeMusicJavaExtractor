SPEAK TO ANGELS

I was there when Jesus came down from the cross...
everyone was just standing round like idiots....

These are the things that u can't explain
killing all of what's making you ok
shouldn't be that way.

so this is how to talk when you speak to angels
dreaming while you walk with chiming bangles yeah
I could see it tonight....

This is what they say when they tell the story cold
hearts waitin for a moments glory
I....
guess I don't know why...
they're always singin'

My love will take u higher
My heart is still on fire yeah...
wanna hear u say

Your love can take this higher
to everything that you desire yeah....
wanna hear you say


tell me babe are you feeling down giving up your hope
sure I know that these feelings they won't let you
go....

these sort of things shouldn't block your way
and believign's all you need to feel ok....
it should be easy....
