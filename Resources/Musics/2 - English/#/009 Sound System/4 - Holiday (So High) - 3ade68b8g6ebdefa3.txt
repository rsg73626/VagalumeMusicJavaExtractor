HOLIDAY (SO HIGH)

On the right kind of holiday
The sun is shining so bright on the land today
There's not a chance I could feel this way
Without the hands of jesus to carry me

I... I... am feeling so high

In a river where I washed away
All my sins
My life began to begin again
Oh oh...

It's been the right sort of time away
So it's been clear
For these last few days

Oh oh oh...

I... I... am feeling so high
