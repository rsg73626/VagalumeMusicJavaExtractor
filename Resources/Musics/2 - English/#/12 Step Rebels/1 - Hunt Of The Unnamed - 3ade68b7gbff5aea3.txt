HUNT OF THE UNNAMED

This desert landscape continues forever
Mountains in the distant land
I've continued on this quest for only god knows how long
Hate and love the reasons i go on

Hate for the monsters that did this to me
Love for my family they took away
My only friend teela marches along
Toward their ever-nearing death

On and on we go
'til we catch up with those monsters and the carnage can unfold
On and on we go
Catch up with those fiends
Extract the blood they stole

I only count the day by the grains of sand i see
The night by my chilling memories.
My only hope is that one day this quest will cease
And the pain will leave my body free

That dark night often plays out to me
I hear the screams of my dear family.
The last look that my wife gave to me
So much pain, for this they will pay.

On and on we go
'til we catch up with those monsters and the carnage can unfold
On and on we go
Catch up with those fiends
Extract the blood they stole
