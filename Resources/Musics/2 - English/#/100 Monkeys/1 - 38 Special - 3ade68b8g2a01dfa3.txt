38 SPECIAL

Well I'm drinkin by myself
While everybody else
Sings songs down in the park
Brown paperbaggin it after dark

Well it's a plastic bag for me
Carrying my groceries
A few cans of champaign
Chose the highlife, for the rain

and the door man calls my name
Good ole Joe sure knows my game
Well he says its the youth to blame
I cant say I feel the same

See I been nursin number one
And too soon beer two is done
And it's three four five six
And their all empty again

And theres still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sittin in my office
With my .38 special revolver

Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Wittin in my office
With my .38 special revolver

Sittin in my office with my .38 special revolver (x4)

Lookin back
Through another empty glass
To the past
When I was so small

Peekin over a counter
That was too tall
Stealin my first sip
Of alcohol

This could be my last slug
Of it all

Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sittin in my office
With my .38 special revolver

Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sittin in my office
With my .38 special revolver

Sittin in my office with my .38 special revolver (x8)

And if the dead haunt the places their bodies are found

Chamber me, one last round to see
If my luck will keep, if my luck will keep
Oh yes chamber me, one last round to see
If my luck will keep this gun company

Drinkin by myself
While everybody else
Is passed out in the park
Or goin home in police cars

They sing
Oh la a da
Oh la tada da
Oh la ta da
Oh la ta da da
Oh la ta da
Oh la ta da da
Oh la ta da
Oh la ta da da
Oh la ta da da
Oh la ta da da
