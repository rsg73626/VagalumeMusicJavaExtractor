MADE OF GOLD

Well, I'm shakey and I'm nervous and I'm anxious as Hell
I'm manic, seeing static, in a panic as well
I'm gonna give myself a heart-attack
but the doctor says I'm much to young for that

I'm gonna give myself a heart-attack
the doctor says I'm much too young...but my hero was much younger than I
when my hero was immortalized
on magnetic tape
and digital sound waves

there's no grave for the soul
no vinyl coffin made of gold
you're made of gold
you're made of gold
you're made of gold
My hero lives on video, my hero lives on video....
...my hero lives on video...

you can watch him groove as he moves by frame
in a mess of curls as the girls scream his name
Spencer Bell!

He was the lyricst a mad scientist
an architect of quick witt
the best to smoke and drink with
the best to joke and think with

he was one of the lost
the first to be found
we'll keep playing his songs
to give us comfort
to keep us proud
to have known this body
whose soul is still so loud

my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
my hero lives on video
video, video tape

well I'm shakey and I'm nervous and I'm anxious as hell
I'm manic, seeing static, in a panic as well
I'm gonna give a heart attack
oohh the doctor
he says you're much too young for that
oh much too young, youre much too young

oh my hero was much younger then I
when my hero was immortalized
