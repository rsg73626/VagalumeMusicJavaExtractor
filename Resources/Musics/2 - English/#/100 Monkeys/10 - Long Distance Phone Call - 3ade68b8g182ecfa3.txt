LONG DISTANCE PHONE CALL

Why am I that weird guy
Who always sits alone
Oh why do I care when no one calls on the goddamn telephone
I grow complacent when no one knows I have 
feelings too
And I feel this way especially when I'm with you

You make me feel alone
You make me feel like a long distance phone call
You make me feel alone when I'm with you
You make me feel alone whenever I'm with you
Well I, I could certainly try to make you recognize
That these pleading eyes ain't asking that much
They're asking can I touch you

But you make me feel alone when I'm with you (4 x)

Well even wallflowers need some water and some tender care (4 x)
Won't you care for me or am I too weird
