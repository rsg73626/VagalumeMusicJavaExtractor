SLEEPING GIANTS

You're a little too lazy for genius,
you'd rather stay in bed, rest your eyes,
rest your dreaming eyes,
while I'm gone, rest while I'm gone

You're little too great for greatness
you couldn't help yourself,
sometimes the world it gets the best of us all,
and its not your fault

You're a little too lazy for genius,
you'd rather stay in bed,
turn in your sheets like a roasting pig,
you're greedy greedy

Could have been the one who saved the world
but you let the world save you instead
Well I canâ€™t blame you I've done the same,
I've done the same damn thing.

You're a little too lazy for genius,
you'd rather stay in bed.
So sleep away for the rest of your days and I'm gone,
wake and I'm gone.
