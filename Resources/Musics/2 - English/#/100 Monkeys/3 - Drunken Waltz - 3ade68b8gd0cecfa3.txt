DRUNKEN WALTZ

This dream I had
I was wrapped in a bag
Something kept tipping me
Till I felt empty

Till I was empty

It drains me

IF you are what you eat
(if you are what you eat)
Maybe you think what you drink

All this whiskey I drink
I never eat

Drink my whiskey with me
Drink my whiskey with me
Drink my whiskey with me

Come drink this whiskey with me

If you are what you eat
If you are what you eat
Maybe you think what you drink

Come drink this whiskey with me
Come drink this whiskey with me
