ORSON BRAWL

There's a story that we like to tell
Down in the backroom we know so well
On the southside side of Austin
Where these blackout monkeys woke up offten

In a dirty saloon, yes the room was a mess
Where the girls are over 30 and the boys are overdressed
On the stage played the man they would call
Mr Orson Brawl

And his band of  stupids
They got that mark of three gain

And now the floorboards are creaking
And all the men wanna kill him
Because thier women are peaking
Only when they call

Mr Orson Brawl
You had it all all all
You had it all all all
You had it all all

Mr Orson Brawl
You had it all all all
You had it all all all
You had it all all all

Well he threw the false prophet down the wishing well oh well
He threw the false prophet down the wishing well oh well oh oh well
Now we're talking dollars and cents
E pluribus unim is

From many we've come
And from many we went
Well That's all done son
You got her pregnant

Mr Orson Brawl
You had it all all all
You had it all all all
You had it all all

Mr Orson Brawl
You had it all all all
You had it all all all
You had it all all

He had a daughter oh he had a daughter
Yes a beautiful baby girl
He had a daughter
He had a daughter
What did he call her
His baby girl

He had a daughter
He had a daughter
Had her laughing the day she was born

He had a daughter
He had a daughter
He had a daughter
And he called her Rock and Roll

She said "Hey big Daddy"
(Hey big Daddy)
He said "Hey there little daughter"

She said "Hey big Daddy"
(Hey big Daddy)
He said "Hey there little daughter"

She said "Hey big Daddy"
(Hey big Daddy)
He said "Hey there little daughter"

She said "I love you Daddy"
(I love you Daddy)
He said "I love you Rock and Roll"

Mr Orson Brawl
You had it all all all
You had it all all all

Mr Orson Brawl
You had it all all all
You had it all all all
You had it all all
