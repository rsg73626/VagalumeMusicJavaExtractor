UGLY GIRL

She was young,
But she liked to act younger then she was,
She was dumb, 
But she liked to act more dumb then she was,
She`s such a young, dumb, impetuous thing
She said when she goes, she'll go smiling
And of course, she'll leave a beautiful corpse

The problem with you is the problem with this world
(x3)

It`s an ugly one and you`re an ugly girl.

She wants to be Grace Kelly, but she`s got no grace.
She's always falling down on her pretty pretty face
The men call her pretty cause she's pretty fun
She`s always after the millionaires` money

She don?t care for anyone else but herself.
She don?t care for anyone else but herself.

The problem with you is the problem with this world
It`s an ugly one and you?re an ugly girl

The problem with you is the problem with this world
It`s an ugly one and you?re an ugly girl

The problem with you is the problem with this
world(x3)
It`s an ugly one and you?re an ugly girl

FUNKEH!

She`s a high class girl in a low cut top

A society girl she don?t know how to stop

The men call her pretty because she is pretty fun
She always makes sure to leave the top buttons undone

If only it`s you(x6)

If only
If only
If only

(she`s an ugly girl)

She`s a high class in a low cut top

A society girl she don?t know how to stop
