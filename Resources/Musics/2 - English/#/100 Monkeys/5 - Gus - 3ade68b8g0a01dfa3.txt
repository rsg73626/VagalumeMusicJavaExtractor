GUS

Gus was waiting in a gold room
With a fancy chandelier
All the ladies they were lined up
By the blood red belvedere

Sweat beads on his forehead
In the crisp Autumn air
All the ladies they had gathered
Old Gus knew his time was near

Gus is waiting in a gold room
With a fancy chandelier
All the ladies dripped with diamonds
Smoke rose from the table in the rear

Bottles made of cold, cold stone
Behind it stood a fallen man
All the liquor had been drunk up
By those monkeys in the band

Gus was waiting in a gold room
With a fancy chandelier
All the people they had gathered
His hand was trembling with fear

Ivory dice lands on green, green felt
When his cheek is taken back
Watch the loser as he rises from his chair
And heads for the subway track

Money has been known to break it's men
And it pays to see the cracks
But sometimes it has to end like this
With everybody dressed in black
