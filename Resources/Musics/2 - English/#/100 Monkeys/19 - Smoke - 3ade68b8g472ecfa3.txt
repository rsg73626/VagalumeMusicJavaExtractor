SMOKE

I take myself down in my own reckoning
Its beckoning me on
Still there is something wrong with me

I don’t know
Could it be
All the smoke
that I choke throught

You say I’m such a stupid,
stupid, stupid boy
You said I’m such a stupid boy
Said I’m such a stupid boy
I’m such a stupid boy

Away, away, away with me
I drown in my own ecstasy, away
Oh woe oh woe oh woe is me
I’m, c’est la vie
C’est, oh, away with me
C’est la vie, I said

I love you much too much
I love you much too much
I love you much too much
Must be some gluttonness fuck
I love you much too much, too much

Oh I’m drownin’ in smoke
And I’m startin’ to choke, as I pull out my coke
With this lighter I hold
Oh, it’s the flame that’s delivering another fine dose
Of sweet sweet smoke

I love you much too much
I love you much too much
Must be some gluttonness fuck
I love you much too much, too much

Oh woe oh woe away is me
I drown in my own ecstasy
Away Away away with me
I’m unimportant c’est la vie

I love you much too much
I love you much too much..
