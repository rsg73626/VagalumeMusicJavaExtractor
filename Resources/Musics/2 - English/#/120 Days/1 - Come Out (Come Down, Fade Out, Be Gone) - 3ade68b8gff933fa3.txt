COME OUT (COME DOWN, FADE OUT, BE GONE)

Break down, build up again
Here she comes with a hand to lend
Get out of bed just to dive into the night
Torn lips and I feel uptight
Come out
Come down
Fade out
Be Gone

I know I'm wrong but it feels so right
I can see my love float out of your mouth and I
taste the different flavours from the night
Rock your hips and I'm up for a fight
Come out
Come down
Fade out
Be Gone

Here comes two zero zero six,
I pray this year I'm gonna get my kicks
but I lost my faith somewhere in the night
I was tryin' too hard to make you feel alright
Come out
Come down
Fade out
Be gone...
Be gone

I know my dreams will drift away
when I open my eyes for another day
and the only feeling that lingers on is that I wanna close my eyes, go back and be gone
Come out
Come down
Fade out
Be gone..
Be gone
