SO THIS IS SUICIDE

Take me dowm to the dreary basement where the sun never ever shines
And show me where you spent the days that killed the smile your eyes.
When you told me what you tried to do,
You made me want to do it too.
When you told me what you tried to do,
You made me want to do it too.

When you said,
Suicide
In your head.
This is suicide.
In your head,
This is suicide
So this is suicide?

Oh here it comes, another day with a slightly different shade of grey.
This is suicide.
This is suicide.
So this is suicide.

This is suicide.
This is suicide.
So this is suicide.
This is suicide.

This is suicide!
So this is suicide!
