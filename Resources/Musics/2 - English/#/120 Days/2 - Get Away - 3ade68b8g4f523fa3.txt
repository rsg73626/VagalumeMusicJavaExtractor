GET AWAY

Aint nothin' better than the city skyline to face off your notes
And I thought I went too far but I didn't even get close
To the things that you've seen, the places I've been
I see through every sin.

Jump off the pavement, I'm goin' in!

She never tried it, that's what she said
I've seen far too much stuff
Get away!

She never tried it, that's what she said
Well I've seen far too much stuff
Get away!

This is easy!

You tried too hard to please me. This is easy!
You tried too hard to reach me.

You start talking and the words start tyin' up
Freakin out, checkin out, what.
There's too much time between us
Did you think I could sleep without you?

Your bones next to mine and I close my eyes
I'll keep my mouth shut, baby
You know the lies

She never tried it, that's what she said
Well I've seen too much stuff
Get away!
This is easy!

She tried too hard to please me. This is easy!
Oh, she tried too hard to please me.
