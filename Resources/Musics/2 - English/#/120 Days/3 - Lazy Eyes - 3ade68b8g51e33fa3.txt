LAZY EYES

Now I'm just hanging in thin air.
Here comes the familiar taste of fear.

I've been digging a hole, I've been digging a hole for myself.

Lazy eyes looking for something new.
I've got so much time and I can't think of anything to do.

I've been digging a hole, I've been digging a hole for myself.

So tell me why I let you in. All you ever did was to pick at my sins.
I'm floating out here in thin air.
Here comes the familiar taste of fear.

I've been digging a hole, I've been digging a hole for myself.

Looking for something new..

I've been digging a hole, I've been digging a hole for myself.
