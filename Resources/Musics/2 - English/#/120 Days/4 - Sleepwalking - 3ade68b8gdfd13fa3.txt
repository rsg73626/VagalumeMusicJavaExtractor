SLEEPWALKING

In a trance, in a trance I could dance this night away
Still I'm sleepwalking my way through this age
I know it must be lonely, I don't want to be this bored again
For I could dance, I could dance, I could dance this night away
Take me somewhere else and make me feel okay
Drifting different ways to a place where all words must end, won't you come a bit closer and I'll push you back again

In a trance, in a trance I could dance this night away
Still I'm sleepwalking my way through this haze
and I've been down on my knees for every tease that looked like a friend
Would you look at me now
I've got every reason to pretend.
