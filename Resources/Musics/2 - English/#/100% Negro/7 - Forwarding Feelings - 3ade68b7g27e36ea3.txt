FORWARDING FEELINGS

I didn't know you baby, but i can feel your soul through 
your green eyes, white baby,
i never though i could love you so much.
Mama says, you are the princess baby,
Mama says you are her breath to keep alive.

Let me tell you
I dont know when you could will read this words by yourself,
but anyway
Days are no so good, in fact its a very bad time,
Living sad, too much pain, too much love.

I had a dream, care for you, see you grow, wipe your tears, 
but was not possible.
The sun will reminds me your face everyday, 
everytime, everywhere,
I hope you feel good, good luck & have a good life.
