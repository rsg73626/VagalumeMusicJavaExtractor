BAD DECISION

Take my blooding heart, my blooding pain, my blooding vain
Take my perverse cells, psychic way, just cocaine
Do it if you could suddenly powerful
Any fear you had just begun to be cool.

Sorry, i took so long to get back to my life
Freak show hit my head, party day, sexy fun
White doors of the past asking me once again
Should you feel so well?, feel insane? feel too dead?

Love in party day of bad religion, live this darky day, your bad decision, love in party.

Shoot the fuckin´ heart, fuckin´ vain, fuckin´ brain
Drug's effect began all diffuse all of us
Sex around the sex, missing lips, missing beds
Vinyl seat in red, bit of blood, open legs.
