SOHO'S NIGHT

Chose the biggest problems baby, 
chose the biggest nasty boys since my body start it with you
make your body stop the war painting up your soul at midnight,
bleecker dance at the noon calling back the art & cry
Calling back that background groove.
Blue & black & sex & night, he says, she says stop the fight
Be your love or be your host, be my mighty speedy road
North & west & east & south, the black spirit is in the house
Digging now the top of crap, sex you up & getting high & high & high.
In soho´s nights, full of action baby
Soho´s nights, its your night.
For your die i call some buyers, for your die a morning blues
I want to run with you honey, i begun to stay by you.
No, no try to be free woman, no, no try to be a gosth
Color up you like the ocean or color up that golden rose.
Learn the words, speaking worst than arrow, bullet, yellow press
Please babe rolling, preach your faith, facing faces, take a test
North & west & east & south, the black spirit is in the house
Digging now the top of crap, sex you up & getting high.
In soho´s nights…
