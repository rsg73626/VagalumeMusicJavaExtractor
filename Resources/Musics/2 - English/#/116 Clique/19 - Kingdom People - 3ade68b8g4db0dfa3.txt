KINGDOM PEOPLE

Hey
I did this track for the church
everbody talking about they livin it dawg
but we need to see it
signed doctor productions
lecrae you heard this
let's get it

verse 1

ey im not ashamed of this 116
my crew flipped up what it did with this
repetentant sinners

blood stained banner
i done rep for my lord whom i represent
from the island of summer
to the gs in the gang with the rocks on they wrists
with they glocks on they hips
but dawg it's the people dying for lack of this information
i pray that everbody
will flock to the rock of ages
especially when they find out we serve a god that's so graciuos
but,
ain't nobody talking to a brother that's incomplascent
ey
we ran until he call us dawg
like adam we fallin dawg
and still he's callin dawg
and sometimes we be stalling dawg
gone ran like an athlete on the trac beat
and the to pack meat on his back like a back seat
you can catch me like a taxi on the back street
but god chooses to save us mayne
pull us out and rep his name
plus through jesus he pleases to use us as his vessles mayne
cats who wanna walk it and talk it
teach it and preach it
they love it they live it
they'll go it wherever they leaded

chorus

we kingdom people we willing to repent and guys that will rep the lord
unselfish forward servants who live to expect the lord
we live to bless the lord
coz we confess the lord
(just believe)all we ever needed was just the lord

verse 2

in the midst of this diasterr
he callin for ambassadors
to hit the street with a clique bent chipped on showing how he did'nt pass the cup
but how he took the wrath for us
and out of love he ask for us
but we ignore and pass him up for the life of the night
that's bad for us
somehow he keeps on grabbin us
attracting us
and before we know it
it masters us
men how dose this happen
we never
but could it be lackin love
we are in the war like maximus
and discipline builds your chacharacter
the tipical way we should live life
so mentor christ on his character
no hocus pocus magic wands
no one cares if you're the pastors son
persevere thruogh the trials of this life
there's no time to be complascent
let hope be your motivation
that's enough to spark a movement even in incarceration
on campus or in the hood
stop
learn the word and spit it bro

chorus

verse 3

ey first thing first dawg jesus lives
heaven dawg you bet is real
reppin him till we dead and still
or at least until the next
reaching for my people in the church
yellin all my kingdom people stand up
men its time we hold it down and live it
come on dawg
coz we christians
men as a
we livin stak on our mission
and if you knew your position you'd be out representing
holding yopur bible and track
yelling revivle is back
on the block in the hood
boom ducks in the wood
beeing troops not even laying back
jesus he died for us dawg
what more we gotta trust god
wth him was the folden the spirit
and that the same spirit
let's put the cross on the move
they should see more than our
let's
hope this is god in your view
god's with us immanuel
and if you not time will tell
dawg i don't iplay with no fire
dawg i don't play
rep his love
rep his grace

chorus
