NO MORE

Verse 1:

I remember thirsting for God, wanting that sweet communion
On and on my soul was longing for us to live this union
Wanted nothing else in life except to just be with Him
Felt like nothing in this world could ever compete with Him

But I'm in college now (college now), trying to walk this out (walk this out)
But its harder now (harder now), can I talk to ya'll? (talk to ya'll)
I got caught in this mess, yearning to walk in the flesh,
And now I thirst for Him less, watching her walk in that dress

I saw the cross and how it took me from the worldly things
And how He told me to cut loss the drunks and earthly things
I know I wanna sin, but dawg I'm born again
And by grace He displace my disgrace now it's on again

So I'mma buffet my body, make it my slave man
Crucify my flesh daily 'til I see my grave man
So I'mma fight, and your games i won't play them no more
Tell the world listen that we're fed up, we ain't gonna take it no more

Chorus:
We not gonna take it no more x8

Verse 2:

No more hang time or playin time
Man its about to be game time
Hate you sin, ya quench the spirit
'Done em them both at the same time

First you had to ride with us
Now my flesh start to rising up
This what 1st Corinthians was talking about all that dying stuff
Sick of heart ache, sick of pain

Sick of you, I gotta quit this man
But me and myself can do nothing without the Spirit man
Eyes havn't seen ears havn't heard the things revealed
By the Spirit dwelling within me through which I'm sealed

I no longer belong to you, I'm not holding onto you
I fight with all this might through every night that I long for you
I wrote this here song for you, my hatred is strong for you
My love for God is greater than the lust that I own from you

Cause everything's wrong with you, the world wanna roll with you
Instead of you enslaving me the Holy Spirit's controlling you
And this here I know is true, the scriptures are showing you
Since I belong to Christ I ain't gonna take this no more from you

Chorus:
we not gonna take it no more x16

Yeah, you know what it is man, we free now.
We were once slaves to sin, but now we free to live righteousness.
We ain't a slave to sin no more man

We ain't no slave to sin
We ain't no slave to sin
We ain't goin take it no mo'
Because we born again (X2)
