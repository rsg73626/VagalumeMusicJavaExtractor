THE RED REVOLUTION

Verse 1:
This is a movement/to get you moving/right now/on a hunt for 100 proof men/for the ones in the Son set free from sin/not bound by their religion or their pigment/skin color, cause that don't make them your brother/so you shouldn't judge a book by its cover/instead be led and live for the Father/see Red is the model because He bled for us partner/and/if this is true then what this means, is/you should do exactly what He preached/and, see the world through the lens of Christ/extend love to everyone who wants to live this life/and lets go/

Hook:
Red (oh), Red (oh)/this is a movement to get you moving/
Red (oh), Red (oh)/the color of a Christian, this is Red Revolution

Verse 2:
Yes sir (yes sir)/I peep the sin of men/because of different melanin they never let us in/and so what (so what)/it doesn't matter if he's different/we should learn to love him/especially the Christian, I mean/look at Jesus walking on the sea of Galilee/just so He could reach the Gentiles, like you and me/and that sea/guaranteed to keep Gentiles from where the Jews lived but/Jesus used it as a bridge/and walked on it/so it's time to walk hommie/for the Christian this love should be more than talk hommie/but a lifestyle, right now/if you seeking change/then seek Jesus name and say this mane/

Verse 3:
This is a movement/for improvement/reconcile relationships that's been ruined, yeah!/got black, got brown, got white/got fam across the globe because we all got Christ/indwelled by the Spirit so now we all got light/they don't label me with colors, they just say that boy bright/I used to think black power, black thought, black owned/and then your boy blacked out, when I saw that throne/the issue's dead cause He bled/I once considered race over faith but now Christ is head/I used to lead but now I'm lead/I used to scream revolution but now I scream, RED!
