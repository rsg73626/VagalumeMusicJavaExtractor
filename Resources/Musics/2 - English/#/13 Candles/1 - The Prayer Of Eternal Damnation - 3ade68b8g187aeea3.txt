THE PRAYER OF ETERNAL DAMNATION

Blood is the life.
Darkness, our feeding ground.
At dusk we are strong.
Like the wounds of dawn, we are gone.
We embrace our immortal life.
And fear not our eternal damnation.
The angels mourn in silence.
For they dare not speak against us.
The angels mourn in silence...
