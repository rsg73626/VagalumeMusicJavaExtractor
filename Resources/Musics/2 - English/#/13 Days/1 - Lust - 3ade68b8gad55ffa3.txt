LUST

You've started a war inside of me,
Two sides starting at the queen bee,
Round and round we circle round the honey tree,
Drown in sweat you crawling all over me.

Rare occasions call for wine,
Wipe it off and flush the swine,
Takin pieces from my mind,
Now you wanna test my fucked up mentality.

This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body)

You command the war inside of me,
Two sides now runnin' for the queen bee,
Round and round they swarm around the honey tree,
Still alive you eat away inside of me.

Rare occasions call for wine,
Wipe it off and flush the swine,
Takin pieces from my mind,
Now you wanna test my fucked up mentality.

This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
You, you will belong to me...
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)

You've killed the war inside of me,
Two sides that were runnin' for the queen bee,
Took em out while they swarmed around the honey tree,
Still alive youve left us without anything.

Rare occasions call for wine,
Wipe it off and flush the swine,
Takin pieces from my mind,
Now you wanna' test my fucked up mentality.

This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
This is what lust is. (can you feel your body crave)
You, you now belong to me.
