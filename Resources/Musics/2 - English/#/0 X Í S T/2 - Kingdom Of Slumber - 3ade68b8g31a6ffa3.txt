KINGDOM OF SLUMBER

On the shores of lakes and streams
Awaits (sic) the heathen gods
As we sail through their lands
To the death of mankind
No remorse, no change of course
Row against the up-stream
We have come for what is yours
Join our kingdom of slumber

Raise one more outcry
We have lost our hope
And come and take yours
Once great and untouchable
Shattered in pieces like the dignity
Of the hypocrites hiding in devotion

Men will come and men will go
Yet who will serve forevermore
Fading images of icons
Will fade for reason
Men will come and men will go
I might have stayed for a while
Just to see the ruins
Of the kingdom of slumber

Raise one more outcry
You have not lost your hope
Come to take what is yours
Once great and untouchable
Shattered in pieces like their dignity
Fall - kingdom of slumber
