UP, UP AND DOWN

Up Up and down
Up Up amd down
Move your booty all around
Thats what we do cause theres a party all around
Come with us if you want to get down
So lets go dance around
Jump up and down
Jump around
(Please slow down)
Up up down
Give him a left hook and knock him down
Up up and down
All we like to do is jump around
Up up and down
Up up and down
Show me the triple crown
Cause you're about to hit the ground
Up up and down
Up up and down
Lets move around
Cause all you're going to do is
Fall to the ground
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
Up up and down 
Up up and down 
Up up and down
Lets go to another town
And party all around
I said up up and down
Up up and down 
I said move all around
Jump Jump Jump
Up up and down
Try not to make a frown
Please hand me a golden crown
Then on the throne, I will sit down
Up up and down
Up up and down
Be careful, you might get knocked down
Up up and down
Up up and down
(Peace Out)
