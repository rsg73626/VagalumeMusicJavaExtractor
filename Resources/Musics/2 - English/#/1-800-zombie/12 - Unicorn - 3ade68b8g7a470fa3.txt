UNICORN

Don?t call me a horse
I?m a unicorn
Mystical, magical, mysterious
Not plain
Got wings like pegasus and a nice white coat
I grant wishes and prance in the rain

U n i c o r n 
That?s unicorn

I?m a unicorn
8000 bc
Noahs ark wasn?t built before me
I?m friends with dragons, bob saget
You think I?m not real?
Full house! I?m in the background, fool!

Eatin grass all day, party all night
I?ll grant your wish
Right before your eyes
I?m hiding in your hills
Eating your apples
Drinking water
Writing facts on your snapples
