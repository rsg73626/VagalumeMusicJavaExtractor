PORTABLE VIDEOGAME SYSTEM

I started out with Sega Game Gear and I loved it a lot
I always though it was very stylish with Ren and Stimpy in the slot
Then it started getting heavy and I started getting bored
But we all know that Nintendo's GameBoy was something that I could not afford

I'll always love you Sega Game Gear
With your 8'x4' measurements
I'm sorry that I betrayed you
When I got GameBoy for Christmas present
