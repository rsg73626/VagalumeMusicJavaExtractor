KIMO

There's a man inside a hotel
room with a gun in his mouth
and he smiles suddenly,
the memories come crashing in
despite the fact that he's better
off without her still images cloud
his mind to confusion just to bid farewell.
This space is for you
it can't be yours till its mine
just another record
makes up for what you did
this old face
