PROJECTOR

I´m the projector 
And you are the silver screen 
I dwell in darkness 
You are what is seen 
And I live for you 
Live for you 
Live for a long time dear 
And it´s been so nice 
Been so nice 
Been so nice to have you here 
To have you near 
Oh, I do care 
I see your face 
Everywhere 
So I drink, drink, drink 
Drink ´til I´m beautiful 
Drink, drink, drink 
Drink ´til I´m pitiful 
& I remember in november 
& I do still 
There where hints & alligations 
& vodka & pills 
& I remember in december 
Your hand in mine 
There where heartaches & tootheaches 
>From all the warm wine 
But I live for you...
