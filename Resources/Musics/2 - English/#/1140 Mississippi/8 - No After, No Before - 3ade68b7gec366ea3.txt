NO AFTER, NO BEFORE

She smells like vanilla 
Her mom´s from Manilla 
It is dark and you walk down the street 
You´re propped full of dope 
Feel like Julian Cope 
And you wanna go someplace to eat 
She talks, you don´t listen 
Something ´bout her sisters 
It is fall and the trees have turned red 
And you don´t like her looks 
And she doesn´t read books 
And sometimes you just wish she was dead 
You just don´t love her anymore 
There´s no after, no before 
There is no sunshine in a fog 
And love is a place where dog eat dog 
So you start to ignore her 
Like all the girls before her 
And you hope she will leave by herself 
But you´re stuck in a spiral 
And fear is your rival 
He shows up when you´re by yourself 
So you worry and weep 
´til you doze off to sleep 
And you dream about her face in the sky 
But you can´t make a sound 
And you´re stuck to the ground 
´cause even in dreams you can´t fly 
You just don´t love her anymore...
