WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE

Your mother´s gonna die 
And you´ll be dressed in deepest black 
Your children´s gonna die 
You know they´re never coming back 
It´s such a lack 
For your worthless self 
And you want them back 
So you dream about the summer they where 12 
Years old 
We´re all gonna die 
Sha la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
Your friend´s all gonna die 
You hide your face and shed a tear 
You´re sister´s gonna die 
And all you feel is worthless fear 
You want her near 
But she´s gone forever 
And you can´t conquer 
The pathetic little demons from your past 
Oh, what a blast 
We´re all gonna die 
Sha la-la-la-la-la-la-la
