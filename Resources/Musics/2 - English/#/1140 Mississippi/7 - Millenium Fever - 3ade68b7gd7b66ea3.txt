MILLENIUM FEVER

Millenium fever 
Everything fall apart 
Even the strongest heart, part 
In the millenium fever 
It gets better in 1000 years 
Stay in here 
Got the millenium stare 
Millenium fever 
The road remain the same 
Heal the lame, millenium shame 
The I-don´t-care fever 
Go nowhere, play with the old toys 
In the sauna with the jack-off boys 
Ugly cowboys 
There´s no need to save the world 
There´s no need to save the world 
The world is just fine 
But the people needs saving 
>From the turn of the time 
The Millenium craving 
Millenium fever 
The sign and the descent 
The dollar, the cent, the corrupt government 
Millenium fever 
Turn the engine off, hear the sound 
Of the buzzing sky, the silent ground 
No-one around 
Millenium fever 
The anastethic scream 
Burn the mind to heal the dream or so it seem 
Millenium fever 
Don´t believe the things you see 
The crack, the smack, the LSD 
The you and me 
There´s no need to save the world...
