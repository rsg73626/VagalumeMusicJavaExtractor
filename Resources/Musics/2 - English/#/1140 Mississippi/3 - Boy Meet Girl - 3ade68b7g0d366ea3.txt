BOY MEET GIRL

Hey, I´m awake what´s that scent in the air 
Do I know this place from before 
I wonder where all of my shoes dissapear 
Just some traces of dirt on the floor 
Does anyone here have some water to spare 
Cause I woke with this terrible thirst 
It´s the romantic notion of harshness to share 
Before my testicles burst 
Boy meet girl they fall in love 
I watch the scene from up above 
The angels are gone where angels go 
Hell, I don´t know 
If these angels are real could they follow me home 
And reward me for putting my trust 
In this bed as the mark of my journey to roam 
Thru the nights of obedient lust 
I am battered to pieces by vodka and sex 
And a fondness for odious sin 
I eep making phone-calls at night to my ex 
And I wish for her scent on my skin 
Boy meet girl they fall in love 
I watch the scene from up above 
The angels are gone where angels go 
Hell, I don´t know
