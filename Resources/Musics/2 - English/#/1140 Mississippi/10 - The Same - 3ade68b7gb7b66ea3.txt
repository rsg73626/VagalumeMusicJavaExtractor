THE SAME

You might live in Gothenburg 
You might live in Spain 
You might add some tenderness 
Or, you might bring me pain 
Here´s another song about you 
It´s not something I want to 
It´s just something that I do 
And I, yeah, I could kiss you right now 
Wouldn´t that be a shame 
Or would it al just 
Be the same 
You might live in Kansas City 
You might live in sin 
You might leave me far behind 
Or change me from within 
Here´s another song about you 
It´s not something I want to 
It´s just something that I do 
And I could kill you right now 
Wouldn´t that be a shame 
Or would it all just 
Be the same 
Be the same 
Be the same 
Never thought that I would crash and burn 
The same 
Be the same 
Never thought that I would turn 
The same 
Turn the same
