LULLABY FOR A SLEEPY GIRLFRIEND

Hush now my baby 
Hush now my love 
The angels are watching 
From heaven above 
They know that I love you 
They know that it´s true 
I´ll stay here beside you 
Whatever you do 
When I wake beside you 
I feel like I shine 
I wish you forever 
And ever be mine 
A new day tomorrow 
When you open your eyes 
You let in the sunshine 
And all darkness dies
