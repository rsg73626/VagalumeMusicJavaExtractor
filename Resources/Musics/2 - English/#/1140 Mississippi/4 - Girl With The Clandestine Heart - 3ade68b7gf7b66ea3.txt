GIRL WITH THE CLANDESTINE HEART

I used to love a girl caled Mary-Jane 
I used to think that people looked the same 
Without their heads on 
But then she made my sky complete 
I used to watch her fall asleep 
I used to kiss her lie the salty sea 
I used to think that we where wild and free 
So independent 
But like buildings people fall apart 
She´s the girl with the clandestine heart 
She used to tell me things I´ve never heard 
It made me raise my head just like a bird 
When it drinks water 
I swore to love her ´til the end of time 
But when I turned around she wasn´t mine 
I should´ve seen it 
I should´ve known it from the start 
She´s the girl with the clandestine heart
