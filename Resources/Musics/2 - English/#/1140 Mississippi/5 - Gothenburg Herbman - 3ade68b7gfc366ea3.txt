GOTHENBURG HERBMAN

It´s the kindness of strangers 
And the absence of harm 
With the Gothenburg Herbman 
And his friendly charm 
He´s got a headful of liquor 
And a fistful of grass 
And his skin is the color 
Of the white middle-class 
He do the crazy handstand 
He do the funny ape 
He do the rock´n´roll band 
He do the total fake 
He want the dolphin flip 
Adidas handball-shoe 
Around the moon and back hit 
He do the I love you 
He´s got a headful of liquor 
And a fistful of hasch 
He´s still watching the sky 
For the two-seven clash 
He is the space invader 
He´s a sex machine 
He is the caped crusader 
He´s a strangers dream 
Gothenburg herbman 
Your super-hero boyfriend 
Gothenburg herbman 
Your super-hero boyfriend
