WITH YOU

It dosen't matter what we do
just as long as I'm with you
I'd do the same thing every day
I've never felt like this before
you keep me coming back for more
and you know I meant to stay

I think about when we first met
the night I never will forget
I couldn't keep my eyes off you
A classic case of boy meets girl
you smiled at me and changed my world
now I feel that way times two

When you hang out with me tonight
I'm sure my day will be alright
if I see your pretty face
And every second that goes by
I think of all the reasons why
my life gets better everyday

When I'm with you, When I'm with you
When I'm with you, When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you, When I'm with you
When I'm with you, When I'm with you

It dosen't matter what we do
just as long as I'm with you
I'd do the same thing every day
I've never felt like this before
You keep me coming back for more
And I hope you feel the same

When I'm with you, When I'm with you
When I'm with you, When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you, When I'm with you
When I'm with you, When I'm with you
