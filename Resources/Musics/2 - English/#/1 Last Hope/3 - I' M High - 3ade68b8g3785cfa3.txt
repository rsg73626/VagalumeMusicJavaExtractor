I' M HIGH

Daydreaming fazes time goes by
That's what happens when you get high
Head's always cloudy, words is lies
Daydreaming fazes, ahh yes I

Daydreaming fazes, life elevated
Chilling in the back of the school gettin faded
I blaze all hell with the skaters all day
Feelin' the rage with the blood on stage

Too many posers fucking with my business
Soaking up my 'fluence can I get a witness
Seven days deep in a smoked out haze
i rolled the T but danny's in a daze

Smoke...don't fight it, I watch your eyes
Surrounded by abuse and our boy is getting high
Presidential lies, keep on wondering why
We got the beat....WE DONT LIE!

Lost in the world of distrust and greed, there's no time to blink,so we plant our seeds, got no time to Drink
Always do what's real, speak what we feel, and pass the (J!)
You know, shit hasnt changed, daddy got game
Need to try and contain from the truth and refrain
If you don't know I'm gonna let it be known, Im still in the penetration zone
That's some whole other shit, and I hold my own
im the kind of guy that stays homegrown

Daydreaming fazes, time goes by
That's what happens when you get high
Head's always cloudy, words is lies
Daydreaming fazes, ahh yes I

What a long strange trip it's been
Sipping life from a jack daniels bottle of sin
Daydreaming fazes walls caving in
What a long strange trip it's been

Life goes fast, like a blunt it don't last
Like flash to the past on the porch outside
Thinking of old times, sitting around getting high
Daydreaming fazes, time goes by
