ANOTHER GUY

Its been................two whole weeks since ive seen ur face
and i just want you to know im not the same
You and your freinds seem to care and dislike
my red spikey hair but it dosent matter to you anyways
becuase to you im just another guy

Why is it that you see every guy
everyone of them but me
and just to let you know i cant go
about my day when theres always another guy..

My Punk rock t-shirts make a big difference to you
just because im not with your crowd
dosent mean your not allowed to go out with me
and i cant just wait till the day that you see
that you are the perfect girl for me

Why is it that you see every guy
everyone of them but me
and just to let you know i cant go
about my day when theres always another guy..

i wake up its another day (YAY!)
NO cause its always the same for me
I see you in the hall
Then i trip and fall
but you just stand there laughing as pick up my stuff
why do you do this to me each day i think ive had enough
but every morning i wake up...and i want you even more
i guess ill just live my life as another guy

another guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyy (x3)

Why is it that you see every guy
everyone of them but me
and just to let you know i cant go
about my day when theres always another guy..
