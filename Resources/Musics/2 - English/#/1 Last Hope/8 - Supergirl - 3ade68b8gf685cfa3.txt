SUPERGIRL

O well here is me on tragedy
i always want whats out of reach
she pulles dyed brown hair back and signs
so fuck that night out with the guys
i never get a word in with them anyway
the telephone doesnt scare me anymore
your home and i am here alone my dear
always stupidly sarcastic my hyper spastic superhero grl
so break the bruised monogamy
and let him fade to memory
your erotic wet atomic eyes keep reoccurrin in my mind
do me a favor please and touch your lips to mine...
