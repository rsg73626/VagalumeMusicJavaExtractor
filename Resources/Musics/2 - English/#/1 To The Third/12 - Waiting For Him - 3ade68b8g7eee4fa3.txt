WAITING FOR HIM

He sometime wonders if you hear him at all 
The words flow at you till he's blue 
The preachin', the teachin', beseechin', answering the call 
You sit there comfy, dozin' in the mahogany pew 

The suit looks spotless but he's still a man 
You're asking him for miracles 
But does he do the best he can 
Is he waiting for you or are you waiting for him 
You're comfy Christian and he's just Pastor Jim 

The job seems thankless often no praise at all 
The end of his day never comes 

Could you spare some blessings to send his way 
Isn't that the least that you could do 
But you're delayin' the prayin' and sayin' no time today 
When all his time is spent on you 

He walked on water He calmed the sea 
He walked into my heart and captured me 
He's leadin' me to believin' I'm even singin' His songs 
Oh yeah He's forgiven all of my wrongs 

This lamb is spotless but He's still a man 
Were asking him for miracles 
And He says yes I can 
He's waiting for us and were waiting for Him 
We the Christians and He the Great I Am
