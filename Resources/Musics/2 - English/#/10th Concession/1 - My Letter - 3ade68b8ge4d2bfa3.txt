MY LETTER

I'll write down, every word that you should know
about where I've been since I've gone.
I'll paint the words with everything that I feel,
every sunset, every dawn.

[chorus] 
I've kept you by my side, you've never left my mind,
you got me through my darkest nights
I hate that you're all alone, I hate not being home right now,
so for the times that we can't be together, please
read my letter.

I will write it down, so I can send 
a piece of me to you from miles away
you're my way out of this dark and distant place.
I can hear every breath you take

[chorus]
I've kept you by my side, you never left my mind
you've got me through my darkest nights,
I hate that you're all alone, I hate not being home right now,
so for the times that we can't be together, 
you've got my letter.

I've kept you by my side, you never left my mind
you've got me through my darkest nights
I hate that you're all alone, I hate not being home right now,
so for the times that we can't be together
yeah just right now that we can't be together,
please read my letter.
