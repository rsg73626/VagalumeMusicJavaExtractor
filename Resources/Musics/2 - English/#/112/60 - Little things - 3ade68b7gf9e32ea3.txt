LITTLE THINGS

Little things mean a lot
Little things mean a lot
When I wanted someone to give me the world
You accepted me and smiled
And let me know that you were my girl
When I wanted fancy things
Gold watches, Diamond rings
You gave me your hand
'Cause only you could understand

[Chorus:]
Little things mean a lot
Appreciate what you got
If you give all what you have
It's forever we'll last
Don't sit around and wait for all
The great things in your life (sweetie)
Little things mean
Little things mean
Little things mean a lot

Giving me the best doesn't mean
Giving me happiness
I'll be satisfied with anything that comes close
I don't wanna settle for less but if I
Do I must confess I won't
Take it if it's not from your heart
Sometimes we get wrapped up
In all the fancy things but
Don't expect life to be perfect
It don't come with static cling

[Chorus]
