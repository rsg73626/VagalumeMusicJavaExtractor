WHEN MY ANGER STARTS TO CRY

Hello psychologist, i've come here to talk
There is a thing i need to figure out
And please don't question me cause then i might walk
And will not make out what it's all about

It's my mentality or maybe my heart
And i don't know if i am weak or strong
When someone does me an injustice it starts
Then i turn feeble and my drive is gone

'Cause I start feeling sorry for the nuisances
And I start feeling sorry for myself
And i start feeling sorry for this stupid situation that appears
When my anger starts to cry

What is the reason that I crumble and sigh?
That I don't dare to be the angry one?
The thought of hurting someone just makes me cry
So I avoid opposing anyone

'Cause I start feeling sorry for the nuisances
And I start feeling sorry for myself
And i start feeling sorry for this stupid situation that appears
When my anger starts to cry

'Cause I start feeling sorry for the nuisances
And I start feeling sorry for myself
And i start feeling sorry for this stupid situation that appears
When my anger starts to cry

I feel like a bull in a big arena
With matadors profiting from my death
I know what's to come is distress and pain
As I feel their agitated breath

I'm being scam over and over again
I'm just trying to hide my fright
I know that my passivity will cause me pain
But still I don't dare to fight

'Cause I start feeling sorry for the nuisances
And I start feeling sorry for myself
And i start feeling sorry for this stupid situation that appears
When my anger starts to cry, cry
