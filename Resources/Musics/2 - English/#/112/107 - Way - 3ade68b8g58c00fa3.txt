Left the cold timber hi shortie, think she a dime
Me on the Mic showed her be sexing going on talking reckless on the phone, she’ll be naked waiting home
Soon as I undress its on, she’ll be screaming Jermaine to 6 in the morning

Girl I need to see you right away
See there’s something on my mind bout u and I
that I gota say, oh baby
Lately we’ve been talking on the 2 way
about watcha like, about wat I like and I think its time we do something about it

It’s been too long since
You had a man in ur life
And whether u know we can not
You need someone to touch that spot that u love
Baby im willing to give u wat uve been missing
Don’t tell my girl, don’t tell my about it
What I need to know is

Do u want me in the way,
The way that I want you, way that I want you
Baby I want you, would you freak me
Could u freak me in the way that I freak you, way I freak you,
Baby I freak you, would u let me

I use to want you so bad years ago

Now the feelings come back, baby its bad
It’s a little bit stronger than before
Is it wrong if I touch ya
Where ur man didn’t touched ya
When he had you baby
Don’t say no baby
Just let me have my way with you

It’s been too long since
You had a man in ur life
And whether u know we can not
You need someone to touch that spot that u love
Baby im willing to give u wat uve been missing
Don’t tell my girl, don’t tell my about it
What I need to know is

Do u want me in the way,
The way that I want you, way that I want you
Baby I want you, would you freak me
Could u freak me in the way that I freak you, way I freak you,
Baby I freak you, would u let me

Do u want me in the way,
The way that I want you, way that I want you
Baby I want you, would you freak me
Could u freak me in the way that I freak you, way I freak you,
Baby I freak you, would u let me
