CHEAT ON YOU

Yo, yo
Yo, if you gonna hit niggaz girl, just expect niggaz to hit yourgirl
And that's it
112 help me say

Chorus: 112

She got with you and
She already had me
Why would she cheat on you
Why would she cheat on you
She got with you and
She already had me
Why would she cheat on you
Why would she cheat on you

Verse One: Mase

Mase, come on
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak
See it's all good, and it's all sweet
All women flirt, all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out of inner sheets blaze plenty freaks
Be the bad boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat
If I didn't work late, I say I was wit my peeps
And quick to tell a hoe, yo I didn't get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

Chorus

Verse Two: Lil' Cease

Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the wanted chick, lotta scotta, protta
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta
Though I love to get a girl that keep her doobie fly
39 in my Benz them niggaz and super size them
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I
If I knew what you knew, you wouldn't be givin the pearls
If you know that she cheap why you live with the girl
Have your cats come live in my world
Cause you couldn't picture another nigga hittin your girl

Chorus

Verse Three: Jay-Z

Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth became
Chicks out mesmerize rub up on they tetas
Like push up bras, who you dealin with ma, jigga
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby
Nice is lawless, recite for ballest
And I fools y'all fake players every time
Cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know I paid his due, but I'm unfatable
Mommi screamin pappi can I skate wit you
They wanna ride wit me, stay fly wit me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase doe
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin
I get Shirley Murrdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Chorus

Outro: Mase

Yo, you can't think you gonna be cheatin and the girl ain't gonnacheat
Just like you cheat, they could cheat
And I just think, your a fool if you think girls don't cheat
