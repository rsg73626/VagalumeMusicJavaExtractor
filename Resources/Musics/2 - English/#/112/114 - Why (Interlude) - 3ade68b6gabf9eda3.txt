WHY (INTERLUDE)

Why,Why,Why Do I Love You
Why
At Times I Sit All By Myself And Wonder
Why Do I Love You
Like I Do

All The Love You've, Given Me
So Special, Seems To Be
No Limit, I'll Do Anything

Why Does The Wind Blow
Why Does The Sun Shine
Why Does The Rain Fall, Down On My Face
Why Does The Earth Spin
Why Do The Waters Reach The Shore
And Tell Me Tell Me Why
Why Do I Love You Like, I Do
Why,Why
