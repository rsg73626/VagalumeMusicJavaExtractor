INTRO - PLEASURE & PAIN

Why do you make me feel this way?
I’m feeling betrayed feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so mad?
I’m feeling so hurt, I’m feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn?
I’m feeling so lost, I’m feeling so burned
If you really, can you make a change
So I can feel pleasure’s and not the pain
