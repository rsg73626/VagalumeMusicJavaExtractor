IF I CAN HIT

Album - Pleasure And Pain

Yo, Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay..

Ay, T.I.P man
King of the South
Rubber Band Man
Boing
With my 4 112

Lettin all those Suckas for lord know man
Keep you girl out the club if you want em
Make No Mistake
We Will Take Your Broads

We be rollin with T.I.
See You Come Through
Baby quit your man he be cuffing you
And we like WOW
Jeans on you, Chick got a fat ass
What she needs too
Baby don't care
In Them Streets
Seein how bad you wanna give it to me
I was saying no
To get in there sweet
She better know what the rules gon be

Stick
When You Split
And No Hits
Won't You Come here with me

Imma chil, how cite you are
What You Don't Know
How to let it go

You're thick
Body Sick
Got That Trip
Keep This between You and Me
You can get it any time you want
Theres one thing you gotta know

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nuthin from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Sayin I done cut this woman

If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cos I think I love em
Cos you let me bend that over

If I Hit

Say it, Don't Flinch, Let me shirt this flick
Wasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick
Now you wanna front like you're scared of it
When at the bar you started grabbin it
I already know how to handle you
Can do you
Before I put the hands on you
Imma beat that thing
Like your man should do
But I don't want a repercussion when we do

Stick
When You Split
And No Hits
Won't You Come here with me

Imma chil, how cite you are
What You Don't Know
How to let it go

You're thick
Body Sick
Got That Trip
Keep This between You and Me
You can get it any time you want
Theres one thing you gotta know

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nuthin from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Sayin I done cut this woman


If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cos I think I love em
Cos you let me bend that over

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nuthin from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Sayin I done cut this woman

If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cos I think I love em
Cos you let me bend that over
(Girl Imma say this once)

The grey goose
Make you wanna get loose
Got your ass bent over
In the new benz coupe
Cos the rims same colour as the ride and the roof
Or maybe cos your friend wanna ride with me too
Maybe it's the way a nigga shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee
Whatever it might be
A neck like ro
Or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those
Cufflinks like these
Baby you ain't never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Fore I get one, but you get like 3
Gottta man well you know theres a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I'm only gonna tell em once, have em finished like a g
You're runnin with the boldest cannon, I'm gonna pull
So before you take off you're panties
What you have to understand

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nuthin from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Sayin I done cut this woman

If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cos I think I love em
Cos you let me bend that over
(Girl Imma say this once)
