NEVERMIND

(1) Nevermind That He Don't Love You
Nevermind That He Don't Care
I'll Give You Love The Way You Want It
Say It's Alright And I'll Be There
I'll Be Right There

Shoulda Known It When I Saw You, Baby
Shoulda Never Let Him Call You Baby
No Matter How I Try
No Longer Can I Hide
The Way I Feel
That's Why I'm Asking You

Repeat 1

I Know All The Places I Want You To Be
And So Many Things I Want You To See
If You'd Only Put Your Trust In Me
Baby I'll Show You Love

(2) Baby I Wanna Put A Smile Upon Your Face
My Lady Say Yes And I'll Be Ready

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

Repeat 1 Two Times

Repeat 2

Repeat 1 Til End
