STAY WITH ME

chorus-
I want you right here with me
If you really wanna be with me
then come on and stay with me
cause I really want to get to know you

Ooh, I want you right here with me
If you really wanna be with me
then come on and stay with me,
come on and stay with me

verse 1-
Look at me, girl I can't believe
This feeling is more then a crush on you
And I can tell, by the way you smile
You feel the same, and were both more then friends

bridge-
If you want me baby then tell me so
why don't you tell me, baby
can't be afraid of love,u gotta let it show
Why don't let your feelings show

It'll be our little secret no one has to know
we can keep it on the down low, baby
we can take it fast, or do you like it nice and slow
I need you by my side

Repeat Chorus-

Can you tell, in my eyes
the happiness when you are in my heart
the joy you bring
makes me wanna sing
I love you and you mean the world to me

repeat bridge-
repeat chorus-

It's not hard, girl to tell that I'm
So in love with you, baby
And I know you know, what I feel cause when, were together
it feels so right
So stay with me

Repeat Chorus till fade-
