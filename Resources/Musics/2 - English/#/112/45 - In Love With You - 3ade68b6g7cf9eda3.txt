IN LOVE WITH YOU

Everday I Think About
All The Love You've Given Me
All The Ways You Show Your Lovin
Girl It Drives Me Crazy
Everday Our Love Grows Stronger
Everytime I See You
Think About This Love You Give Me
Girl I Can't Get Over You

(1) Baby You Know
Just How I Feel For You
Tell Me Your Love
Will Always Be Here For Me
I Need Your Love
Don't Ever Take It Away
Tell Me With Me
Is Where You'll Always Stay

(Chorus) You Are So Special To Me
I Need You Here With Me
Someone To Love Me Always
I'm In Love With You
You Are So Special To Me
Why Don't You Stay Here With Me
So We Can Be Together
I'm In Love With You

Everyone I Love Before Me
No One Else Compares To You
No One Does The Things To Me
That Make Me Feel The Way I Do
Everytime I See Your Pretty Face
It Makes Me Love You More
All The Time I've Looked For Lovin
Now It's Knockin At Me Door

Repeat 1

Chorus

You Mean The World To Me
And You're More Special Than You Think
Baby You Must Believe
That I Love You

Repeat Chorus Til End
