SWEET LOVE

Verse 1

And I want your body close, you on top of me (can you feel me)
Im gunna make your body drip all over me, baby me inside of you

So take off all your clothes, and through them on the floor ( you wont need them)
Cuz im gunna give you every little thing you need and more
Let me tell you what i want.......

Chorus
I wanna make love, sweet love
All night long, till  the rising of the sun
Bring your body close to mine, and it feels so right
Dont let go of me
Girl, I wanna make love, sweet love
All night long, til the rising of the sun
Bring your body close to mine, and it feels so right
Dont let go of me

Baby I can give it to you anyway you like it, you just let  me know
Im giving you the keys so you can drive me fast or slow
Cuz on this ride of love, we gunna go to places you and i aint never been before

Baby imagine me kissing all over u
You body's trembiling, i know your feelin me
Oooo know its gettin serious and im tired of being curious
Girl my body is filled wit lust, I cant take it no more
I am about to explode

Chorus(4x)

Girl, the chemisty between us I cant explain
I love to hear you call my name
And I can see it in your eyes that you want me too
Dont u be afriad of what im gunna do to you
Girl, the tears you cry are out of happiness,
Pleasure, unstead of lonliness
Baby every single part of me inside of you,
Pleasin you, teasin you, makin sweet love

Chorus(6x) out
