IF ONLY I COULD

If only I could
Get through this
I get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, make it
Make it through
I'm gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta take my
Take my mind off you

Give me just a second
And I'll be all right
Surely one more moment
Couldn't break my heart
Give me till tomorrow
Then I'll be okay
Just another day and
Then I'll hold you tight

When your love is
Falling like the rain
I close my eyes
And it falls again
When will I get the chance
To say I love you?
I pretend that
You're already mine
Then my heart ain't
Breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I could
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
God, gotta help me
Get through this

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, make it

Make it through
Said I'm gotta
Get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta take my
Take my mind off you

Give me just a second
And I'll be all right
Surely one more moment
Couldn't break my heart
Give me till tomorrow
Then I'll be okay
Just another day and
Then I'll hold you tight

When your love is
Falling like the rain
I close my eyes
And it falls again
When will I get the chance
To say I love you
I pretend that
You're already mine
Then my heart ain't
Breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I could
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
God, gotta help me
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
God, gotta help me
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
God, gotta help me
Get through this
If only I could
Get through this
