I'LL BE THERE

I know it's kind of hard
To get over someone
And try to start a new
A new relationship
No need to rush cuz you
Have all the time in the world
Right now let's focus on
How we can keep you happy

I can feel it when you hurt
You will never be alone
All those crying days are gone
I'll be here to guide you
Baby I will be right there 
And you know I'll always care
Ohh Baby

[Chorus:]
You can call on me
No matter what the situation
I will be there
Put your trust in me
Whenever you need someone
I will always be there

I know it broke your heart
Your love is truly over
He left you sad and lonely
Now you're feeling empty
You've got to realize
He made a big mistake
Leaving you was the worst thing he could ever do

I can feel it when you hurt
You will never be alone
All those crying days are gone
I'll be here to guide you
Baby I will be right there
And you know I will always be right there

[Chorus]

Baby listen to me
And girl you will see
That I'm the only one for you
I'll give you what ever you need
You can depend on me
I'll be your friend
I will always be right there, oh

[Chorus]

I can feel it when you're hurt
Girl, you're never alone
Oh, all those days are gone
I will be there
Oh, I will be there
Just to guide you
You're never alone
Girl, you know I'll always care
Right there, right there

You don't have to worry
I'm gonna be by your side
Even when times are hard
Just count on me and
I will always be there

[Ad lib until fade]
