DAMN

Damn
Why d'ya have to look so good
Damn
Why d'ya have to be so sexy
Damn
Why d'ya have to dress so fly
Why d'ya have to catch my eye
Ohh wont somebody tell me why

Damn
Why'd i have to fall in love
Everytime when i knew that i wasn't ready
Ohh why, why did i fall for you
Why did i love her too
What was i supposed to do

(chorus)
Damn, no i never really meant to break your heart no
Damn, no i never really meant to leave you lonely
Damn, but i had to accept that we were not happy (it just wasn't)
It just wasn't, working

Damn
Why d'ya have to be so cool
At a time, when me n my girl was having our problems
Ohhh
Damn
Why'd she have to be so cruel
Why did i turn to you
Did i make the wrong move?

Damn
Why did you give me space
At a time when my girl was tryin to crowd me
Ohh damn
Why d'ya have to take her place
Why did you have to stay
Why was it too late for us

(chorus x2)
Damn, no i never really meant to break your heart no
Damn, no i never really meant to leave you lonely
Damn, but i had to accept that we were not happy (listen)
It just wasn't, working

Maybe i should let it go
Or should i let her know
I got another on the side
And she does everythin right
I dont know what else to do, im not happy with you, you just aint doin..

When she steps in
And everythin i need she's giving me i cant believe
Just how good she is to me
And i dont ever want her to stop
'cause i lover her so much, all that i can say is
Damn

(chorus)
Damn, no i never really meant to break your heart no
Damn, no i never really meant to leave you lonely
Damn, but i had to accept that we were not happy (listen)
It just wasn't, working
