Wanna sex, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream

**verse 2**
I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby inside of you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the taste of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream

**verse 3**
Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got your legs around my neck so I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A' shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches,
Shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach is shit
Put your hands in the air represent your clit

**chorus**
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
(Girl, you are so tasty)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
(Girl, you taste so good to me)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream
