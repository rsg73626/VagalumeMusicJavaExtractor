THIS IS MY HEART

[Chorus:]
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me
This is my heart
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me
Do you love me

We belong together
The love I feel is strong
And I wouldn't take the world for exchange for this feeling I have inside of me
And I can't loose this
Love that I have in my heart and baby
I know that you will never leave
This is my heart

[Chorus]

Our love keeps us together
Whenever we're apart
Our bond holds us close
We live in each other's hearts
And so I'll always feel whole
Somewhere I know I'll find someone
With some love to give
To one whose heart is fragile
But I'm willing to take a chance
This is my heart

[Chorus]

[Mike's monolouge:]
My arms are open wide
You can't imagine how I feel inside
Welcome to this land, baby
Because I'm here to give my heart to you

[Chorus (fades out)]
