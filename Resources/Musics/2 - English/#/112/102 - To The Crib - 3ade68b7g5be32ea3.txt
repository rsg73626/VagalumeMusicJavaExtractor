Me and 112 we off in the club
Representing a-t-l in the club
Hollaing at every girl off in the club
Shorty gonna be witt me we dip from the club

Can you handle my stick for me
Keep it movin while you kissin on me
Girl you're makin me so ready,
When we hit the door, put it on me

We can bounce from the club, to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, go, come on, my room we go

What you really wanna do tonight
Coz its way too hot in the club tonight
We can start it in the parking lot
Coz its all about you, tell me what you like, come on

Can you handle my stick for me
Keep it movin while you kissin on me
Girl you're makin me so ready,
When we hit the door, put it on me

We can bounce from the club, to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, go, come on, my room we go
Go, go, come on, my room we go
Tell me what you really wanna do tonight, come on

We can bounce from the club, to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, go, come on, my room we go

When we get to your room, tell me what you gonna do?
Ive gotta turn you on, so tell me what you gonna do?
Stop talkin, wastin time, tell me what you gonna do?
My drop tops in the parking lot, so tell me what you gonna do?

We can bounce from the club, to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, go, come on, my room we go

We can bounce from the club, to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, go, come on, my room we go
