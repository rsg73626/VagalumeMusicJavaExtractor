WHY DOES

All The Love You've, Given Me
So Special, Seems To Be
No Limit, I'll Do Anything
There's No Boundaries, To How
We Can Go, How Can I Let You Know, Girl
Let Me Sit And Think

(Chorus) Why Does The Wind Blow
Why Does The Sun Shine
Why Does The Rain Fall Down On My Face
Why Does The Earth Spin
Why Do The Waters Reach The Shore
And Tell Me Tell Me Why
Why Do I Love You Like I Do

Oooh In The Past You Were There When I Was Down
My Friends Could Not Be Found
Your Touch Kept Me So Strong
What If Love Didn't Fade Away
Instead It's Endless As The Sky
That's Why I Must Ask Why
Oh Must Ask Why Why

Chorus

I Ask Myself The Question
Time And Time Again
Baby I Love You
Yes I Do
Why Did You Have To Hurt Me
And Leave Me All Alone
Baby I Love You
Now I'm All Alone When I Need Your Love

Repeat Chorus To End
