KEEP IT REAL(INTERLUDE)

We'd Like To Sing Another Song For You
Is That Alright, Is That Alright
Alright, This Song Was Written For Puffy
In Dedication Just Letting Him Know We Really Appreciate
All He's Done
So Puff, This Is For You Man
Continue To Keep It Real

Mmmm
You Just Don't Know
The Way You Make Us Feel
Through Your Work
And Through Your Vision
So Young Black And Gifted
Oh Oh Oh
Mary J's Love Was Real
Notorious B.I.G. B.I.G.
Craig Macks The Brand New Flavor
And Jodeci Forever My Lady
Ohhh
Oooh Yeah Baby
112
They Just
Don't Know
The Pains Of Being Real
When The World Is Being Exempted
From Being Young Black And Gifted,Oh Oh Oh
It Seems
So Hard
To Sing It As We Feel
People Change Just Like The Seasons
Without Reasons People Try To Keep It Real
