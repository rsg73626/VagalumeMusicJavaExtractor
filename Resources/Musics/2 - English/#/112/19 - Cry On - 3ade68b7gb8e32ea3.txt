CRY ON

When your burdens seem to weigh you down
Or the road, it seems too far to carry on, oh yeah, yeah
Just look to the hills, you will find your help
Is coming from the Lord, hold on

Even when you feel you can't go on
And even if you have to mourn
Let your soul cry out to the Lord
112 cry on, yeah

Cry on
God understands your tears
He knows, he knows, he knows
He knows how much that you can bear
Your faintest cry, He's gonna hear, yeah, yeah

Cry on
When there's nothing else to say
Soon He'll wipe it
Soon He'll wipe all your tears away

Without test and trial
You won't experience real joy, oh no
Gold without fire
It will never ever be pure gold
Yeah, oh
And without hitches
You will never know
The Lord can bring you through, through
Even when you feel you can't go on, go on
Let your soul cry out to the Lord
To the Lord, to the Lord

And without trials
You will never know
That my God can bring
Bring you through
Yes He can

Even when you feel you can't go on
Even if you have to mourn
Let your soul cry out to the Lord
Listen to me cry late at night
But that's alright
Go ahead and cry

Cry on
God understands your tears
He knows how much that you can bear
Faintest cry He's gonna hear

Cry on
When there's nothing else to say
He'll wipe all your tears

Weeping may
Endure for the night
But joy comes in the morning time

Weeping may
Endure for the night
But joy comes in the morning time

Joy comes in the morning time
Comes in the morning time
