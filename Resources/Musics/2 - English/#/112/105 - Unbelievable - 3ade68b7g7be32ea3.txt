UNBELIEVABLE

This is a DPS production…

Give me a beat. [X8]

I’m gonna have some fun tonight
Lookin for a girl tonight
Lookin for a perfect per-son-ality
And she gotta have a freaky side
I wanna know…
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then this is what I need

Girl let me be your everything
Baby all that you need and more
Shakin off all this drama in my life
Girl I’m kickin it at the door
I wanna know…
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then come to me, so unbelievable

Chorus

So unbelievable
Your love is incredible
If you’re available (girl this is what I need)
Then just let me know
So, So unbelievable
Your love in incredible
If you’re available
So unbelievable
So, So, So, So…

I’m gonna have some fun tonight
And I wanna get sexual
Put you lips on top all over me
And you know that I like it slow
I wanna know…
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then this is what I need

Gonna make your dreams come true tonight
Cause baby I’m feelin you
We can do just what you want, just what you like
Cause it’s all about me and you
I wanna know…
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then come to me, so unbelievable

Chorus X2

The dambdest thing
I wanna buy you all the finest things
Big house in the hills
Supersize your rings
My mind’s on my money
And my money’s on my mind
Get you up out of the ghetto
I just want you to shine
So don’t be telling your girls my money don’t stretch
And don’t be sayin that 112 don’t make hits
Cause you know I moved up
>From the 5 to the six
When I shift with the radio
I know they gonna like this
Sayin Def Jam is like sayin no stress man
Tv’s and champaign in the stretch Lex man
Pour a glass for yourself and pass it to the next man
Takin trips from Atlanta to the Kamen Islands
Forget your problems, lay back, catch a tan
You know we livin it up, chillin in the sand
Catch me off in the club, spend a couple grand
It’s Un-be-live-a-ble

Chorus X4
