U ALREADY KNOW

Papa coming home, like to give you that RAW
Ur favorite position, from da back Door
Girl u know da drill don't ask no question...
U ALREADY KNOW!!!

Tonight's your night girl, I'm tryna give u that thing to make you say....
From the kitchen floor down to the fire place
Insense burning, your body's talking that shit to me.
Cancel that Phone... the only sound I'm tryna hear is your moan.
You riding topless, no panties on...
And I've been thinking 'bout this all day long,
Your giving me the fire dont...

[Chorus]
Papa coming home, like to give you that RAW
Favorite position, from da back Door
Girl u know da drill don't ask no question... U ALREADY KNOW!!!
Papa coming home, like to give you that RAW
Favorite position, from da back Door
Girl u know da drill don't ask no question... U ALREADY KNOW!!!

Is your girl Jenny home?
Call her up and tell her it's 'bout to be on.
Tell her don't show if it ain't heels and thongs.
I can already see it....
Ooh What a feeling!
Just don't get jealous if i hit that to hard cuz U come first,
You know your my heart.
Cuz it'll always be yours, girl I'm 'bout to turn you out!

[Chorus]

U know just how I like it to see it...(U know just how i like to see it)
U know just how i like.... U ALREADY KNOW
U know I like 2 go down... I love it when u go down
And u Know I wont stop until you get it.... U ALREADY KNOW

[Chorus (x4)]
