FUNNY FEELINGS

Oh Baby
Girl I, Girl I
Got The Funny Feelings
Oh Yeah, Yes I Do
112 Yeah
Q

Everytime I Try To Kiss Your Lips
You Turn Away
And When I Try To Hold You Near My Heart
You Just Tell Me Not Today
Well The Days, Grow To Weeks
And The Weeks Just Add On
And I Try To Be Strong
But I Feel Like You Don't Love Me
Anymore

(Chorus) Funny Feelings
Fun-ny Feelings
That You Don't Love Me Anymore
Funny Feelings
Fun-ny Feelings
That You Don't Love Me Anymore

I Find Myself
Sitting By The Phone
Waiting For It To Ring
And Though My Mailbox Is Always Full
But From You I Never Receive A Thing
Well I Try
To Just Go
By The Things That You Say
But The Things That You Do
They Just Tell Me That You Don't Love Me Anymore

Chorus

Oh Baby
Well I Try
I Try To Just Go
By The Things, The Things That You Say
But The Things, The Things That You Do
They Just Tell Me That You Don't Love Me Baby, Anymore

Chorus
