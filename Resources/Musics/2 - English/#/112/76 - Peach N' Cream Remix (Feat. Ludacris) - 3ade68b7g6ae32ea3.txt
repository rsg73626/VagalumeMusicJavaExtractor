PEACH N' CREAM REMIX (FEAT. LUDACRIS)

Yo, yo, yo, yo, (bad boys motha fuckaz) 2001 we still here, yeah, this is the 
remix
A-town, don't stop, 112, def jam, bad boy
[Ludacris]
Ludacris like em shakein' not stirred, wakein' up blurred,
Walk butt naked, talk SPEECH slurred,
Necks get squeezed and I can't breath stop then switch,
lets get mean, Body kinda taste like lemon merange,
so nice I add spice wit' the cinammon thang,
make u pull ur own hair, make ur body go flat get the spare out
well smack lips smack hips, make em back flip, cake mix, 
Finger lickin' like tacktics Tounge Gymnastics 
 good head makes ur eyes 
[112] roll back,
112 on the track so u can't 
[112] hold back
Bread and butter peaches and cream only reach for the peach if it's 
peachy clean
now only reach for ur spot to release the steam
A-town to release the kings

[112]
Let me tell you what I wanna do,
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna sex, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over
Can't get enough of you
Always thinkin of you
So sweet, so very wet,
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

[Chours]
Peaches and Cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and Cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

[112]
I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby inside of you
Love the way you're juice flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ohh I love the taste of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

[Chours]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream 

[112]
Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got you legs around my neck so I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A'-shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air and represent your clit

This is the dance break........
this is the remix,
just, just bounce to this, yeah 
can I get a lick, can I get a lick

[Chours]

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, Peaches and cream

[Fade to end]
Oh girl I need it 
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean 
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my van
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
