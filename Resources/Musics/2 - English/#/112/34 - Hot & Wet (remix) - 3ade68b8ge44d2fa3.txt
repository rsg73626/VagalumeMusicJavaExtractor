HOT & WET (REMIX)

[Intro] 
 112112 
 You know how we do 
 This is the remix 
 Guess who s back 
 Bad boy baby 
 Yo luda talk to  em 
  [Verse 1 Rap] 
 Now baby you don t work if u work it 
 Tweak it twork it 
 I feel like your every imperfection is perfect 
 Luda yea what you heard is true 
 I ll make u do things you ain t even know you can do 
 Got them weak in the knees cuz my back is strong 
 And you wonder why your girls wanna tag along 
 Cuz them birds are jealous 
 My words are embellish 
 Plus they heard I kiss every curve and crevice 
 I m too hot to handle 
 I rock your mantle 
 When I play 112 and light 16 candles 
 Deep sea fishing in your favorite position 
 Everytime you moan I pay close attention 
 Flip  em like a pancake 
 Show me something 
 Or we can bring in your vibrating tongue ring 
 Lets mountain climb  til we reach the peak 
 The technique will make u sweat 
 But don t sweat the technique 
  [Verse 2] 
 I wanna show you how I feel 
 Don t hold back 
 Heres my love 
 Baby you re the one for me 
 How can we get down tonight 
 No more game lets spend some time 
 Baby won t you give it to me 
 Jus give it to me baby 
  [Chorus] 
 You don t know what 
 You do to me 
 The way you touch baby 
 Girl I m tired of playing games are you ready 
 I love it when you re on top of it 
 So spread it 
 Won t u just give it to megirl we can do it 
 [x2] 
 Hot and wet 
 Girl u make me wanna sweat 
 When u touch me like that 
 Girl you know I wanna give it to you 
  [Verse 3] 
 Baby now it s getting late 
 Don t stop now 
 I can t wait 
 To show u belong to me 
 Know how I like it 
 Take your time 
 Close your eyes 
 Let me show you what real love should be 
  [Chorus] 
 You don t know what 
 You do to me 
 The way you touch baby 
 Girl I m tired of playing games are you ready 
 I love it when you re on top of it 
 So spread it 
 Won t u just give it to megirl we can do it 
 [x2] 
 Hot and wet 
 Girl u make me wanna sweat 
 When u touch me like that 
 Girl you know I wanna give it to you 
  [Chingy] 
 Face downass up 
 Thats the way i like the cup 
 I like you slim in the waist 
 With no thurr 
 The girl got me doing push ups tin herr 
 The big dog 
 She got me dealing drugs 
  [Chorus x2] 
 Hot and wet 
 Girl u make me wanna sweat 
 When u touch me like that 
 Girl you know I wanna give it to you 
  [Bridge]

 Girl i m gonna make you sweat 
 Keep it real close to me 
 And let it drip all over me
