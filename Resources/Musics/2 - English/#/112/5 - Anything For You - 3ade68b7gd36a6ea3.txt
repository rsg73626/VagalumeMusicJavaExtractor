ANYTHING FOR YOU

I can't believe
Only years ago,
All I really wanted
Was to be with you, baby
I can't imagine how
To live my life without you
I'll do anything for you
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm all turned out
I don't know what to do
I feel so down and out
I wish somebody tell me
Hurry up and tell me
What love is all about
Girl you're drivin' me crazy
Can't you see baby
You can't leave me alone
I'll do anything for you

You knew there's
Nothin' I would not do
I'll try to cross the
Seven seas to be
With you, baby
Just believe that
 
I can make your
Wishes come true
'Cause I'll do
Anything for you

Repeat chorus

So many times
I wonder
There's a limit
Through this all
Girl to me, to me
All that I
Know is that
When it comes to you
There are no
Limits

Wish somebody tell me
Wish somebody tell me
Ooh
Oh girl, girl you're
Drivin' me crazy
Drivin' me crazy
Can't you see baby, ooh
Girl I'll do
Anything for you
Girl I'll do anything baby
Anything for you

Repeat chorus

I love you baby
