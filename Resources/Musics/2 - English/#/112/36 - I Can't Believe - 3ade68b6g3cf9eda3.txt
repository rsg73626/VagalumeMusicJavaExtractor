I CAN'T BELIEVE

CHORUS

I can't believe that love
has gone away from me
I can't believe that love
Has gone away
I can't believe that love
Has gone away from me
I can't believe that love's
gone away
(I can't believe you've gone away)

1ST VERSE

All those days and nights
I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I
Would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad
A broken heart was never meant for me

Lord let it please rain on my face
So that it could wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in
Let me leave
'Cause I don't wanna be
Hurt like this again
I can't believe

(repeat chorus)

Many times I watched you
While you were asleep
With thoughts of living life
With only you
If I had read your mind
And things could have changed
I'll give anything
To be with you again (again)

All I ever wanted was to see your face
And hear your pretty voice
>From day to day
Now that you're gone I have no reason
for feeling that way
I can't believe you've gone away

(repeat chorus)

BRIDGE

When I think back on the times we shared
All the times we shared
Don't you know
Don't you know you were my love
My only love

(repeat chorus)

Baby I love you
You've gone away from me
Thinkin' about you all the time
Tell me why did you leave
