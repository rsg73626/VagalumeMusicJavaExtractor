Baby..(112)...Be right here for you
You already got a man..ooh (112)..be right here for you
But I see the way he treats you and baby I know I can treat you alot better..ooh (112) be right here for you
Whenever you need me, Im right right here for you

Verse 1
Listen, Baby you dont have to cry
So why wont you wipe your tears from your eyes
Girl, I need for you to see
WIth me is where you know you need to be
Whatever it is..girl dont hesitate to call on me
You dont have to worry bout a thing
Coz I'll be right here waiting for you

[Chorus]
And whatever he wont do..I'll do (I'll do it for you baby)
Whatever you need, I'll give to you (I'll give to you baby)
Whenever you cry, I'll cry with you
Baby just call on me and I will be right there waiting for you
(Right there for you)

Verse 2
Whenever you think of me

That you somewhere you aint suppose to be
Just give me one chance
To prove to you, Imma better man
Never break apart..whatever he wont do..
You know I'll do it for you

[Chorus]
Whatever he wont do, I'll do (Baby whatever just tell me)
Whatever you need, I'll give to you (I will give to you)
Whenever you cry, I'll cry with you (I'll do it girl)
Baby just call on me and I will be right there for you (right here for you)

Refrain:
I'll do things for you, that your man wont do
I'll prove my love to you..Girl, I'll die for you
I'll hold you tight..all through the night
To let you know itll be alright
You are my world..please be my girl (say you'd be my girl)
I'll make love to you..I'll take care of you
Girl Im gonna show you that I'm right here for you...Baby

Repeat Chorus 2x till it fades...
