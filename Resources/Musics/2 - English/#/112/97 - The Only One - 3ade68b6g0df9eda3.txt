THE ONLY ONE

Lil' Kim:
Uh Uh
Catch Me In The Spot
No C's In The Drop
About Half An Ounce
Inside The Ziploc
Knockin The New One One Duece
On The Duece Me And My Old Flame
And His Name Is Bruce
But, Blew My Eye
When His Girl Drove By
Told Me Bye Then He Winked His Eye
I'm Too Down For This
To Fly To Curse
Threw His Jacket Out First
Ba-Bam In Reverse

112:
Oh Baby
You Need To Know
I've Been In Love
And I've Never Known Love Like This
I Need To Know
Just How You Feel
Let Me Know If Your Love Is Real


(Chorus) I'm Tired Of Wasting Time On You
So Tell Me Whatcha Wanna Do
Is It Another Man
Holding Your Hand
Why Is This A Mystery
Oh Baby Can't You See
Girl You're The Only One
I'll Ever Want
The Only One
I'll Ever Need

Repeat Chorus

Oh Baby
I Think It's Time
For Us To Grow
We've Been Friends Now For Far Too Long
The Way You Kiss
It Turns Me On
Let Me Know If You Feel This Strong

Repeat Chorus 2 Times

Give Me Your Love
Don't You Know That I Need Your Love
I Need You Here In My Life
Baby Please
I'll Take Your Pain (I'll Take It All On Me)
I Need You Here With Me

Lil' Kim
Let's Pretend Like We Friends
And Do Our Own Thing
We Can Chitty Bang-Bang
But Let The Phone Ring
From The First Night
Knew You Was Untrue
Ex Girl Came Through
She Said She Missed You
Panties In The Bathroom Sink, Hot Pink
What's A Girl Like Me Supposed To Think
I'm A Bad Girl
You Shady, I Get Shady
Tear Up Your Old Lady
In The Benz Mercedes
Go Quinne

Repeat Chorus Til End
