LONELY HEART

Mike and a girl talking to each other:]

[Girl:] Mike..
[Mike:] Yeah, baby
[Girl:] It's over
[Mike:] How can you say that?
[Girl:] I'm sorry. The love is gone.
[Mike:] No, please don't leave me.
[Girl:] Don't feel bad.
[Mike:] How can I not feel bad. I love you.
[Girl:] But, it's better this way.
[Mike:] No. I don't believe this.
[Girl:] No, baby

I never thought that it could be
You would turn and do this to me
I can feel the love that we had between us
Merely fade away
You told me you'd never go away
And for me you'd always be here
Now you tell me that somethings wrong and you must move on

[Chorus:]
Lonely heart is what I'll be
And no one cares for me
Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care
But I need you to show me now

I'm lookin' for a quiet place where love is free
And the dreams we shared last eternally
I feel now that it's the time
So won't you please come over here
The closer and the closer I get to you
Keeps me warm to know that you'll stay around
So please keep your promise to me and don't go

[Chorus]

Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care
But I need you to show me now

[Chorus (fades out)]
