EVERYDAY

this is the real right here
things ain't always what they seem

check it
people look at us and say "man they got it made"
they signed a record deal and now them boys is paid?
but they don't know what comes along with this
with all the fame and fortune is still b...
cause even though we strugglin hard
and gave up everything to make it this far
some people love and other people hate us
but we gon' take the haters make them our motivators
cause they don't know what we been through
and none of them can walk a mile in our shoes
man i got to keep it real
not every record deal ain't a good record deal
i'm a grown man so i didn't cry by
to keep my head up stay strong 
until i got about that contract
and i reminisce on what my lawyer used to say
but i wanted it so bad i guess i have to learn the hard way

[2x]
(everyday) the pressures of this game got us goin' insane
(everyday) if it ain't one damn thing it's another thing

people wanna know what's going on with 112
if they leave or they records gon' sell
they sayin that they give us the hits
knowin' damn well that we write our own sh*t
it's not that i'm mad about it
but i got to clear it up for those wondering about it
i think you need to read the credits
open up the cd dawg and read the credits
cause things ain't always what they seem
so don't believe everything you see on tv
in the videos i was in a bentley
when that bentley didn't belong to me
my earrings had to be at least 5 karats
had to live up to that superstar status
stayed on the road, had to stay doin' shows
even though i'm goin' broke, i couldn't let nobody know

[2x]
(everyday) the pressures of this game got us goin' insane
(everyday) if it ain't one damn thing it's another thing

people look at us and say how does it feel
on a new label with a motown million dollar deal
i'm just glad we stayed together
we put our faith in the lord and he made things better
cause he said it in his word
that one day you'll gonna get what ya'll deserve
now aren't you glad we stayed together
through the good and the bad times we stayed together
through the rich and the broke times, through stormy weather
and heeeey now we look back like don't you remember
when you couldn't afford that boy
heey sun roofed top
chillin' on a see, with a down-south ...
like heeey how you love that
24 inch rims, big body cadillac and
heeey, we do it like that

[2x]
(everyday) the pressures of this game got us goin' insane
(everyday) if it ain't one damn thing it's another thing

from 96 to 2003 - 112 still keepin together
all we need is true fans all around the world
our music gonna last forever
[fade to end...]
