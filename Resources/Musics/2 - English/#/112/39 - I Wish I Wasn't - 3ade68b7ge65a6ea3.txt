I WISH I WASN'T

verse1

i'm home alone again
and you're out hanging with your friends
so you say
somehow i know it's not quite that way
it's getting pretty late and you haven't checked on me all day
when i called you didn't answer
now i feel like you're ignoring me
i wish that you were home 
holding me tight in your arms
and i wish i could go back
to the day before we met 
and skip my regret

chorus

i wish i wasn't in love with you
so you couldn't hurt me
it just ain't fair the way you treat me
no you don't deserve me
wasting my time thinking about you
and you ain't never gon change
i wish i wasn't in love with you
so i wouldn't feel this way

verse2

when you touch me my heart melts
and anything you did wrong i forgive
so you play me and take advantage 
of the love i feel for you
why you wanna hurt me so bad
i believed in you that's why i'm so mad
now i'm drowning in disappointment
and it's hard for me to even look at you
i wish that you were home
holding me tight in your arms
and i wish i could go back
to the day before we met 
and skip my regret

(chorus)

bridge

said you care about me
but from what i see
i ain't feeling that so i disagree
gave you all my love and understanding
and you're treating me like your enemy
so leave me alone
don't want nothing from you
just go back to where you came from
this house is no longer your home
you are not welcome no no no more

(chorus)

verse 3

hear you knocking at the door again
i'm wondering should i let you in
i open up the door and see the flowers for me
so beautiful in your hand
please stop begging me to take you back 
i've always been a sucker for romance
and before you know it i concede
you all over me
oh no here i go again
i wish i wasn't in love with you
so you couldn't hurt me
