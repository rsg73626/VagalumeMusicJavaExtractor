FOR AWHILE

Faith Evans:
Ohh
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Oh Yeah

Living My Life Without You
Something I Don't Wanna Do
So Please Don't Walk Away
And Leave Me All Alone
Baby Stay For Just Awhile

(Chorus) Why Don't You Stay With Me
For Just A While
Cause If You Leave
You'll Take A Piece Of Me
Why Can't You Stay With Me
For Just Awhile
(Boy)(Girl) You Know You Have
The Key To My Heart

Slim:
Ooh Baby
Girl I Don't Want You To Go
You Are, My Heart And Soul
The Reason That I Live
The One, That I Adore
And I Can't Stand The Thought
Of Being, By Myself
But I Can't See Myself
Loving No, Nobody Else

Chorus

(Slim): Girl Why Won't You Just Stay With Me
There Is Nothing I Won't Do For You
(Faith): You Are My Destiny, Oh Yes You Are
(Slim): You Mean The World To Me
(Faith): Whenever
(Slim): Girl I'll Be Right By Your Side
(Faith): I Love You
(Slim): Love You
(Faith): Baby
(Slim): Baby
(Faith): Stay With Me
(Slim): Why Won't You Stay With Me Baby
(Faith): Stay With Me
(Slim): Stay With Me Baby, Lil' While Longer
(Faith): You'll Take A Piece Of My Heart
(Slim): You Will Take A Piece Of Me
And Girl You Know I Love You Too
(Faith): Just Awhile
(Slim): Girl You Know
You Have The Key To My Heart
Stay With Me
Won't You Stay With Me For The Rest Of My Life
(Faith): Cause If You Leave You'll Take A Piece Of Me
(Slim): Your The Only One Never Let Me Go, Baby
Girl You Know You Have The Key To My Heart
Oh Baby
Stay With Me Baby
A Lil' While Longer
Stay With Me Baby
A Lil' While Longer Baby
