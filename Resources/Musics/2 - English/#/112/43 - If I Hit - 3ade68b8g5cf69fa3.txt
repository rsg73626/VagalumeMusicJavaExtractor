IF I HIT

[Intro]
Yo, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay its T.I.P man, king of the south
Rubber band man, boing
With my 4 1-12
Letting all those suckers for lord know man
Keep you girl out the club if you want ‘em
Make no mistake we will take your broads

[Verse 1]
Everytime I, 
See you come through 
You be with your man he be cuffing you 
I be like wow, jeans on you
Chick got a fat ass what she needs too 
Baby don’t care in them streets 
Seeing how bad you wanna give it to me 
I was saying no 
To get in there sweet 
She better know what the rules gon’ be 

[Hook]
When you stick, when we split ain’t no hits
Won’t you come here with me
I’m a chill, n il set u off
What you don’t know how to let it go
You’re thick, body sick, but don't trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
Thers one thing you gotta know

[Chorus]
If I Hit 
Promise 
I ain’t gotta hear nothing from ya 
Yo nigger riding up with that drama 
Saying I done hit his woman 
If I Hit 
Promise 
There ain’t gonna be no drama 
Tellin' ya, ‘cause I think I love ‘em 
’Cause you let me bend that over 
If I Hit

[Verse 2]
Say it, Don't Flinch, Let me shoot this flick
Wasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick
Now you wanna front like you're scared of it
When at the bar you just kept grabbing it 
I already know how to handle you 
Candle do you 
Before I put the hands on you 
Imma beat that thing 
Like your man should do 
But I don’t want a repercussions when we do 

[Hook]
You stick, when we split ain’t no hits
About you coming with me
I’m a chill, n il set u off
What you don’t know how to let it go
You’re thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
thers one thing you gotta know

[Chorus x2]
If I Hit 
Promise 
I ain’t gotta hear nothing from ya 
Yo nigger riding up with that drama 
Saying I done hit his woman 
If I Hit 
Promise 
There ain’t gonna be no drama 
Tellin' ya, ‘cause I think I love ‘em 
’Cause you let me bend that over 
If I Hit

[Rap: T.I.]
The grey goose make you wanna get loose
Got your ass bent over in the new Benz coupe
’Cause the rims same color as the ride and the roof
Or maybe ‘cause your friend wanna ride with me too
Maybe it’s the way a nigga shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee whatever it might be
A neck like whao or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those, cufflinks like these
Baby you ain’t never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
Gotta man well he knewthere’s a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I’m only gonna tell ‘em once, have ‘em finished like a G
You run up with that bull, this cannon, I’m gonna pull
So before you take off you’re panties
What you have to understand

[Chorus]
If I Hit 
Promise 
I ain’t gotta hear nothing from ya 
Yo nigger riding up with that drama 
Saying I done cut his woman 
If I Hit 
Promise 
There ain’t gonna be no drama 
Tell you yet, ‘cause I think I love ‘em 
’Cause you let me bend that over 
If I Hit

[Outro]
Body sick
Gotta come here with me
112
We can hit
Body thick
Gon’ be tripping with me
That's right, then you gotta know

[Chorus]
If I Hit 
Promise 
I ain’t gotta hear nothing from ya 
Yo nigger riding up with that drama 
Saying I done cut his woman 
If I Hit 
Promise 
There ain’t gonna be no drama 
Tell you yet, ‘cause I think I love ‘em 
’Cause you let me bend that over 
If I Hit
