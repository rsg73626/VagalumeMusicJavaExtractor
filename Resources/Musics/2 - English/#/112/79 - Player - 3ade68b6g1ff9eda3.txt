PLAYER

I'm a player
Girl I thought you knew,
when you started messing around with me
knew I wouldn't commit to you
Cuz I'm a PLayer
And I know you can't see it in my eyes
Everybody says that I'm innocent
And it should come as no surprise
that I'm a player
And I really think you need to know

that I can't love you right now baby
Cuz i still need more time to grow

But when I do
Get ready
to settle down
Baby the first one
I'm callin' is you
when I do
Get ready
to settle down
Baby the first one
I'm callin' is you
But until then

I'm a player
And I've traveled all around the world
I've broken many hearts
And It really hurts me to say this to you girl
But I'm a player
and It's kinda sad that It has to be this way
But I don't wanna lock you down until I'm ready
So right now I'm gonna play

But when I do
Get ready
to settle down
Baby the first one
I'm callin' is you
when I do
Get ready
to settle down
Baby the first one
I'm callin' is you
But until then..

But when I do
Get ready
to settle down
Baby the first one
I'm callin' is you
