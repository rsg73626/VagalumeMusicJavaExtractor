PEACHES 'N CREAM

So hot, hot
It's the S the L the I the M
Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna sex, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always thinkin' of you
So sweet, so very wet
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

You know the whole repatwah, u.s. to the u.s.s.r.
Sexin in the Lexus car, match wisdom w/ the best of y’all
The rest of y’all is like vegtaballs and my presence checkin
Reminiscan' to nothing you ever heard
den I realize dat it didn’t make sense
then backtrack show me where the cash at

I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby inside of you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the taste of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream


Kim got ‘em in the zone, beatin' their dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' they tits
Ha ha ha ha ha… wut, I’m lovin' this shyt
Queen Bytch, well didja know that thuggin' like this
Imagine if I was a dude and hit caps from the back
Wit no strings attached, yeah nigga picture dat
Cuz y’all niggaz ain’t shyt

Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got your legs around my neck so I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A' - shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air represent your clique

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
