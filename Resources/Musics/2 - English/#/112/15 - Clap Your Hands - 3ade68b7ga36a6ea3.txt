CLAP YOUR HANDS

(Bad boys)

CHORUS:
Why sit there, lookin' at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feelin' me
And I really want you to get close to me
So would ya dance with me, dance with me
My drop top's in the parkin' lot
And I'm gonna take you back to my spot
But we still got a little more time to rock
So would ya dance with me, dance with me

I can see you over there
Just chillin' with your girlfriends
Can't believe you're by yourself
You should be here with me
Chillin' with me
Drinkin' with me
Freak' with me

Oh, oh, oh

CHORUS

I can see it in you eyes
That you're lookin' at the time
You wanna leave this party
And I know you wanna leave with me
To chill with me
To drink with me
To freak with me

Oh,baby, oh, oh

CHORUS x2

If you're sexy and you know it clap your hands
If you're sexy and you know it clap your hands
If you're sexy and you know it
And you really wanna show it
If you're sexy and you know it clap your hands

Yeah

CHORUS X5
