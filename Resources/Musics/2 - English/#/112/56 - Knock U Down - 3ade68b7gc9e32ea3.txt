KNOCK U DOWN

Intro

The way I wanna knock you

Verse 1

Girl you got just what I need 
bring it here to me
You can stand in front of me
or get on top of me
Cuz Iâ€™m gonna do to you whats
never been done to you
Gonna give my all to you

Chorus

It just ainâ€™t right 
how bad I wanna knock you down
All night
ridin me up and down
Feel so tight
the way you squeeze it girl
Just ainâ€™t right all night sometimes

Verse 2

Lay right there an close your eyes
tell me what you like
Anything you want from me
your gonna get it tonight
Donâ€™t be scared to let it go
baby let it flow
Girl I want you so bad

Chorus 2x
