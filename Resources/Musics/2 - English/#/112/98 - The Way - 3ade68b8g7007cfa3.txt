THE WAY

This is the time where you all should report to the dance floor
112 So So Def
Stop, wait a minute, hold up love
J.D. plus 112 add that up
Now, that equals me seein' you in see-through
Now, whatever the chain go I let the bottle of three do
Jeans by E-vesal check out the Vs too
A roof free coup do you like what you see boo (You like what you see)
2324059 left a cold tip behind
Shawty think she a dime
Me on her mind, sure to be some sexin' goin' on, talkin' reckless on the phone, she be naked waitin' home
Soon as I undress it's on
She be screamin' Jermaine till six in the mornin'

[Verse 1]
Girl I need to see you right away
There's somethin' one my mind about you and I that I gotta say oh baby
Lately we been talkin' on the two way
About what you like about what I like
And I think it's about time we do somethin' about it at home

[Bridge]
It's been so long, since
You had a man in your life
And weather you know it or not
You need someone to touch that spot that you love
And baby I'm willin' to give you what you've been missin'
Don't tell my girl
Don't tell my girl about it
What I need to know is

[Hook]
Do you want me in the way
The way that I want you
The way that I want you
Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you
The way that I freak you
Baby I freak you
Would you let me

[Verse 2]
I used to want you so bad years ago
No the feelin's come back
Baby infact, it's alittle bit stronger than before
Is it wrong if I touch ya
Where your man didn't touch ya
'Cause he had ya baby
Don't say no baby
Just let me have my way with you

[Bridge]
Been so long since you
Had a man in you life
Weather you know it or not
You need someone to touch that spot
that you love
And baby I'm willin' to give you what you've been missin'
Don't tell my girl
Don't tell my girl about it
What I need to know is

[Hook]
Do you want me in the way
The way that I want you
The way that I want you
Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you
The way that I freak you
Baby I freak you
Would you let me
[Repeat]

Get your freak on
[Till fade]
