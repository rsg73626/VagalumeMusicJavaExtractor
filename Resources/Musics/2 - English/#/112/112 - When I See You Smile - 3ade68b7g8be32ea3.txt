WHEN I SEE YOU SMILE

(verse one)
Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world
without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue 
Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach out for me 
Sometimes I wanna give up
Wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
AND ONE LOOK AT YOU BABY 
can make everything all right
can make everything alright

(chorus)
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining
right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me 
Oh yeah 

(verse 2)
Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
ooooohhhh 
And when the rain is falling
I don't feel it
Cause you're here with me
AND ONE LOOK AT YOU BABY
It's all I'll ever need
All I'll ever need 

When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining
right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me 

(bridge)
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you baby
can make everything alright
can make everything alright
It's alright 

(chorus)
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh you know I can do anything (that i can do anything)
When I see you smile (when i see you smile)
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining
right through the rain (baby when i see you smile)
Yeah
When I see you smile
Yeah I can face the world (everyday)
Oh you know I can do anything (everyday)
When I see you smile
Oh yeah
Baby when I see you smile at me 
when i see you smile.. baby when i see you smile..
aaaattt me..
