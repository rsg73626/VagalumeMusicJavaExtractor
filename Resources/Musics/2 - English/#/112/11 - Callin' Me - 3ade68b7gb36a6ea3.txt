CALLIN' ME

feat. Lil' Zane

A little life of a celebrity
A made nigga, way bigga the mother
Can't your love see
Know what I'm sayin'
Can I talk to you for a minute
It's like I'm doin' a lot of interviews
I mean, just people callin' my name everywhere
Hey, Zane
You know what I mean

A little life of a celebrity
A made nigga, way bigga the mother
Can't your love see
I'm gettin' paid like I'm 'posed to
My homies call me on my mobile
Wanna hang, we still close too
I scoot position with the poor cats
I write raps
Make millions like that
I like that
And there never was a rich man
A rubberband for a wristband
Got dough and had to switch plans
Drama still don't stop
The freeway, gettin' chased by some bad b****es
Wantin' autographed pictures
They want my name tatooed on 'em
Lookin' for man to hit that as*
Make a move on 'em
Hey Hennessy with Charnet
Mix it, I put the trees in the garce
Twisted, a true player smokin' purple hay
Two shots in the air for my true thugs out there

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name
Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name

Let me explain what the game like
I did a show in California, had to be in Las Vegas the
same night
Me and 112 on the same flight
It ain't easy bein' worldwide
I see murder go in vain in this Rap game
Gotta stay strapped
So I pack things
All my niggas pack things and plus we love to ball
Don't want no problem with you homey
I mean none at all
And to my rich cats with them big face bills in the
air
My poor cats sell more sex to you there
Love we millionaires
Been all around the world
Turned the squares into true players
Cheap watches turned to Cartiers, locals turn to
gators
 
Point 3s turn to 5 Cs
All these car keys, jump in the Benz hit the Shark Bar
You know they love to see a hot star

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name
Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name

And for my dogs I ain't seen in a while
I still got love for y'all and got a chance to return
your call
I'm in Chicago, I'm gettin' paid
Now bigga figures everywhere that I go
I'm still hearin' 'bout the drama poppin' in the hood
Heard that you niggas doin' good and I like that
Heard it said niggas block glock
You tell me that Big Chris runnin' drop tops, flossin'
I'm gettin' letters from my fans, got to write back
Put a fly picture in the mail, hope they like that
Bringin' the fame don't kill us all
The magazines to the big screen
It ain't easy at the sh*t scene
Throwin' the producers as I pass by
Showin' love to the Southside, all the players outside
And we gon' spend Gs tonight
Hotels, don't need sh*t, free tonight
Come on

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name
Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me

Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name
Callin' me, callin' me, callin' me
Say my name

This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I'll waste no time at all
They won't stop callin' me
