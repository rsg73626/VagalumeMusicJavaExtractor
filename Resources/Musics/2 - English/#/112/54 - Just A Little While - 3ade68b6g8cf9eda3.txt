JUST A LITTLE WHILE

Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
Come Back To You Babe
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
Woo

I Have To Go Away
My Flight's Not Far Away
You're Thinking Of Astray
But It's Just Your Mind
My Heart Is In Your Hand
Waiting For Your Command
That's Enough Assurance To Believe I'm True
So Baby Hold On

(Chorus) Just A Little While
Just A Little While Longer
Just A Little While
I'm Coming Back To You
In A Little While
For A Little While Longer
In A Little While
I'm Coming Back

A Thousand Waste Of Tears
Our Love's Been Strong For Years
Your Cry Is Not In Vain
Cuz I Understand
I'm Trying To Be The Man
You Loved When We Began
Your Cry Is Not Alone
I'm Crying Too
You Gotta Hold On

Chorus

If Only You Knew My Love
You Wouldn't Feel This Way
Baby Don't Be Afraid
Cuz I'm Coming Back
Do You Hear My Plea
Forever Stay With Me
In My Arms You're Gonna Be
In Just
I'm Coming Home

Chorus

There's Gonna Be A Better Day
There's Gonna Be A Brighter Day

Repeat Til End
