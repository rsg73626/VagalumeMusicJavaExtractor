CLOSING THE CLUB

Yeah... 112, three mafia

I'm in the club drunk as hell,
With my dawggs 112.
I gotta 112 girls i'm tryin to sell a dream to
So i need to holla at the club owner,
And hit him whip out 10 stacks to keep it open longer.
112 and three6 mafia, we kickin in the club
Chippin on the eree-herb till it's right down to the nub.
Atl and memphis tenn mixed together nothin but love,
It's a trip when playas meet, get on this level
Nigga whaaaat....

Girl talkin like she gon be famous tonight
She got that ?? tellin her that she can take that.
The beat got her trippin, and the heat got her pumpin
And she screamin at the dj don't stop playin that.
Oh shorty's got a body, came if you want nobody
So tonight you know i'm gonna frame that.
She's drivin in the truck and sayin you can be my nigga
But the night is still young so why don't you fall back. oh!

Cause she really wanna see me tonight.
