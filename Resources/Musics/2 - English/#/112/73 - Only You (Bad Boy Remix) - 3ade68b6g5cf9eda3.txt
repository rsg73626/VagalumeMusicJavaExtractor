Do We Share This Special Thing Called Love
I Know I Do What About You
I Just Can't Get Enough Of Your Time

No One Else, Only You
Why Can't We Just Make It Happen
Baby, I Need You In My Life

Everytime I'm With You

So There You Go Girl With Thousands In Your Palms
Why You Can't Let By Gones Be By Gones (Good Fellas)
