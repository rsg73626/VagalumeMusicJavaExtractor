HOT & WET (FEAT. LUDACRIS)

I wanna show you how I feel
Don't hold back
Heres my love 
Baby you're the one for me
How can we get down tonight
No more game lets spend some time
Baby won't you give it to me
Jus give it to me baby

You don't know what
You do to me 
The way you touch baby
(Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready)
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
(Won't u just give it to me, girl we can do it)

Hot and wet 
Girl u make me wanna sweat
When u touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you

Hot and wet 
Girl u make me wanna sweat
When u touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you

Baby now it's getting late 
Don't stop now 
I can't wait
To show u belong to me
Know how I like it
Take your time
Close your eyes 
Let me show you what real love should be

You don't know what
You do to me 
The way you touch baby
(Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready)
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
(Won't u just give it to me, girl we can do it)

Hot and wet 
Girl u make me wanna sweat

Now baby you don't work if u work it
Tweak it twork it
I feel like your every imperfection is perfect
Luda yea what you heard is true
I'll make u do things you ain't even know you can do
Got them weak in the knees cuz my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls wanna tag along
Cuz them birds are jealous
My words are embellish
Plus they heard I kiss every curve and crevice 
I'm too hot to handle
I rock your mantle
When I play 112 and light 16 candles 
Deep sea fishing in your favorite position
Everytime you moan I pay close attention
Flip 'em like a pancake
Show me something
Or we can break in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb 'til we reach the peak
The technique will make u sweat 
But don't sweat the technique

You don't know what
You do to me 
The way you touch baby
(Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready)
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
(Won't u just give it to me, girl we can do it)

Hot and wet 
Girl u make me wanna sweat
When u touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you

Hot and wet 
Girl u make me wanna sweat
When u touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you
