WHY CAN'T WE GET ALONG

[Verse One:]
Is it me,
Who never compromise,
I only see things through my eyes,
Which means is my way?
Or is it you
Who's always shutting down,
Never wanting to talk about the problems we got?

Pre-Chorus:
Or is it we to blame for all that's going down?
I say that I love you but we can't work it out.
It's making us not wanna stay around.
We need to sit down and ask ourselves..

Chorus: 2x
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

[Verse Two:]
Tell me
Why can't I look at you
And see your point of view
And take the back seat?
Is it true
That I'm so unreasonable
And I don't know how to love
Even though God sent to me to you?

Pre-Chorus

Chorus 2x

[Bridge:]
I just can't sit and watch us go at each other this way.
'Cause you know like I know we're better than this.
Girl, I've tried everything in my heart but it's weighing to be
more than just your man.
'Cause you deserve the best.
Together we're the best.
We just can't throw it away...

Chorus 2x

[Bridge Two:]
'Cause you know I love you, and I know you love me
Can we, can we baby?
Oh, why can't we get along, when we both know that this is
home?

Chorus
