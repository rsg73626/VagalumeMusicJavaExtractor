SMILE

Another night and it seems that he
made you cry yourself to sleep
remenising on how it began
You found pleasure in this man

Chorus:
and you fell like an autumn leaf
for his lies now you won't leave
give me just one chance
cuz I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
you've sat alone and cried
you don't deserve it
cuz I believe that I can make you smile

Tranquility then misery
day to day will it ever cease
here's my shoulder it's ok to cry
cuz I know I'll make it right

Chorus:
cuz you fell like an autumn leaf
for his lies now you won't leave
baby give me one chance
cuz I believe that I can make you smile
I know a tousand times
you've sat alone and cried
you don't deserve it
cuz I believe that I can make you smile(I'll make you smile)

Woah I'll never never make you cry
so pretty baby dry your eyes
I'll never never make you cry
I promise baby your too precious
I'll never never make you cry
(ohhh) so pretty baby dry your eyes baby
I'll never never make you cry

Chorus:
cuz I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
you've sat alone and cried
you don't deserve it
I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
you've sat alone and cried
girl you don't deserve it
cuz I believe that I can make you smile
I'll never never make you cry
(I'll love you always)
so pretty baby dry your eyes
I'll never never make you cry
(I'll love you always)
so pretty baby dry your eyes
forever and ever
oh yea
I believe
