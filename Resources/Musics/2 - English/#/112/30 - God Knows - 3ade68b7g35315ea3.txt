GOD KNOWS

[Verse 1:]
Baby tell me why, why do you question
All this love that I have for you
If you look into my eyes you’ll make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
Put your trust in me, allow me to be there
Baby give me your hand to hold
Cause the feelings that I have are so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows

[Chorus:]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I’m thinking of you
And I’m longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows

[Verse 2:]
Baby tell me what, what is the reason
One good reason you’re so insecure
Cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
Girl I’m down for you and the love I have is pure
I wanna help you understand just how I feel for you
You’re the one that I can’t let go
Because the feeling that I have is so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows

[Chorus (2x):]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I’m thinking of you
And I’m longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows

And all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely
And oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry
And everytime I think of you, only God can read my mind
God knows I tried to help you understand
And Heaven knows I miss you
Only God can see how much
Cause everytime you go away, I long for your touch
And when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart
He sees my heart, only God knows

[Chorus:]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I’m thinking of you
And I’m longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows
