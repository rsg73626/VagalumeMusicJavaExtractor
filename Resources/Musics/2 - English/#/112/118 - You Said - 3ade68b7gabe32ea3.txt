YOU SAID

Verse 1
It was you, it was me
It was love, it was real
We would touch, we would kiss
And we'd love the way it feel
It was time spent together
Leaving all the world behind
And I thought it would last
But only time would tell, so I waited on time
Pre-Hook
How could you be so selfish
Never once did you compromise
And you wonder why I'm trippin'
Shake my head and close me eyes
How could you never listen
When I try to talk to you
And you knew something was missing
When I'm running from the truth
Hook
Baby you said (You would never leave me)
Said you (Always be there for me)
I can't (Understand the reason)
Why you (Why you want to play me)
You said (You would never leave me)
Said you (Always be there for me)
I can't (Understand the reason)
Why you (Why you want to play me)
Verse 2
Remember when, we would chill
You would tell me how you feel
You wanted me, you needed me
The only one to ease your mind
I was caught by surprise
To hear you say you want to leave
But it's cool if you gotta go
Then go ahead and leave, I'm gonna be alright

Bridge
You used to be in love and you used to be so good
You used to drive me so crazy
Now is the time when you were loving me like you should
Back in the day you were my baby
You used to be in love and you used to be so good
You used to drive me so crazy
Now is the time when you were loving me like you should
Back in the day you were my baby
Hook x2
