LOVE YOU LIKE I DID

Tell Me Who's Gonna Look At You
And Love You For The Person You Are
Tell Me Who's Gonna Understand
That Sometimes You Can Take Things Too Far
Tell Me Who's Gonna Be There When
Times Are Good And When They Are Bad
Tell Me Who's Gonna Love You Girl
The Way I Loved You

Tell Me Who's Gonna Be Right There
To Wipe Your Tears Whenever You Cry
Tell Me Who's Gonna Talk It Out
To Make Sure That Everything Is Alright
Tell Me Who's Gonna Call You On The Telephone
When You're All Alone
Tell Me Who's Gonna Love You Girl

(Chorus) Ain't Nobody Gonna Do The Things I Did
Ain't Nobody Gonna Kiss The Way I Kissed
Ain't Nobody Gonna Spend The Way I Spent
Ain't Nobody Gonna Love You Like I Did
Ain't Nobody Gonna Be The Fool For You
Ain't Nobody Gonna Open Doors For You
Ain't Nobody Going Through What I Went Through
Ain't Nobody Gonna Love You
Love you Like I Did

Anytime You Needed A Friend
Girl I Was Right There For You
Anytime You Needed A Lover
You Could Call On Me For That Too
There Is Nothing, Nothing That I Wouldn't Do For You
Tell Me Who's Gonna Love you Girl
The Way I Loved You

Everthing You Always Wanted
Girl You Know I Gave It To You
Never Had To Worry Cause You Knew
I Would Take Care Of You
And You May Find Another Man
But Can't Nobody Love You
The Way That I Loved You

Chorus

How Could You Do It
Baby Baby How Could You
You Did Me Wrong
Treat Me The Way You Did
You Broke My Heart
And How Could You Leave Me
Leave Me By Myself
When You Know I Did
I Did Everything For You
And You'll Never Find Another Man
To Love You The Way That I Did
Girl Nobody, Nobody, Will Love You Just Like Me

Repeat Chorus Til End
