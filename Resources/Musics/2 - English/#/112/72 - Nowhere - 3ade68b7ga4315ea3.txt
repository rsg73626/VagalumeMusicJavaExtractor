NOWHERE

If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I aint never,
Lemme say that again,
I aint never, goin nowhere
Listen to me

Last night I allmost cried when you told me 
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gunna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that i've got for you
Im telling you

When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere

I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
Untill I found you and you made it 
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you dont know the half of it
But baby heres the rest of it

Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and im the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby thats for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this

When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere

When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere
