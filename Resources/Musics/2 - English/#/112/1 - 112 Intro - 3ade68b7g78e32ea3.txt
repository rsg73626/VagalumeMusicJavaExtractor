112 INTRO

Puff:
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about
Sounds real dramatic, like somethin's comin
Got that real intro type vibe to it
Yeah
Enough of this smooth....
Its Bad Boy, baby


We go by the name of Q, Mike, Slim, Daron
And this is Part Three
You know, like the third album
Like the third time we been here
Like Part Three
And oh yeah, they represent the ATL
Come on
 
Slim: 
Just a little 12 is all you need
Just a little 12 is all you need
Just a little 12 is all you need
Aw, baby
Just a little 12 is all you need

Puff:
Let's do it.
