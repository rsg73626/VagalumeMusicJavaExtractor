SAY YES

[Verse 1:]
I wanna show you how I feel
Don't hold back
Heres my love
Baby you're the one for me
How can we get down tonight
No more game lets spend some time
Baby won't you give it to me
Jus give it to me baby

[Chorus:]
You don't know what
You do to me
The way you touch baby
([Slim:] Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready)
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
([Slim:] Won't u just give it to me, girl we can do it)

Hot and wet
Girl u make me wanna sweat
When u touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
Baby now it's getting late
Don't stop now
I can't wait
To show u belong to me
Know how I like it
Take your time
Close your eyes
Let me show you what real love should be

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ludacris:]
Now baby you don't work if u work it
Tweak it twork it
I feel like your every imperfection is perfect
Luda yea what you heard is true
I'll make u do things you ain't even know you can do
Got them weak in the knees cuz my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls wanna tag along
Cuz them birds are jealous
My words are embellish
Plus they heard I kiss every curve and crevice
I'm too hot to handle
I rock your mantle
When I play 112 and light 16 candles
Deep sea fishing in your favorite position
Everytime you moan I pay close attention
Flip ?em like a pancake
Show me something
Or we can bring in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb ?til we reach the peak
The technique will make u sweat
But don't sweat the technique

[Repeat Chorus till end]
