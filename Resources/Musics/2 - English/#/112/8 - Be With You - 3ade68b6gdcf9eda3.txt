BE WITH YOU

I Used To Hang Out Every Night
Used To Go From Club To Club
Looking For True Love
But Now I Found That Love In You
No Longer Have To Sleep Around
Cause I Have You
Baby

(1) Girl I'm Always Thinking About You
And All The Things You Do For Me
Makes Me So Happy
And Girl Whenever You're Near Me
My Love Is Always Here For You
I Really Wanna Be With You

(2) There's So Much Out There For Me
But The Only Thing I Want
Is To Be With You
So Many Places I Can Be
But The Only Thing I Want
Is To Be With You

I've Traveled All Around The World
Seen Alot Of Girls
But None Can Compare To You
No Matter How Far I May Go
I'll Always Know That Home Is You
And That's Where I Want To Be

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

(3) Every Hour Of The Day
My Thoughts Are Always Of You
You Are Always In My Heart
Can't Stand To Be Apart
Whenever We're Not Together
It Seems Like Forever
Day Dreamin About You
I Really Want To Be With You

Repeat 2 Two Times

Repeat 3

Repeat 2 Til End
