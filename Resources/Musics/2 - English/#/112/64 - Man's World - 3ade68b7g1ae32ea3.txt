MAN'S WORLD

Chours 1
Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe
(Repeat 2X)
Verse 1
A man is important
In a scheme of things
He's the King of his castle
And the head of his household
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in
Chours 2
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
Verse 2
A man is imperative
In the world we live
He's a father to his children
And the head of a nation
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a provider
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in
Chours 2
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
(Repeat 2x)
Bridge
Now tell me who's the King of his castle
And tell me who wears the pants around here
Whos a father to his children
A man like me
Now who would be the queen of the castle
Sitting beside you through the thick and the thin
She's the corner stone of this family
She's the mother of the earth
Even though she living in

Chours 2
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman

Chours 1
Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe
