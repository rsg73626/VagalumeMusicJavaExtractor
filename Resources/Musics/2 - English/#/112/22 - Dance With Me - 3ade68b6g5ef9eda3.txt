DANCE WITH ME

[Chorus:]
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
and I really want you to get close to me.
So wont you dance with me...dance with me.
My drop tops in the parking lot
and I wanna take you back to my spot.
But we still have a little more time to rock
So would you dance with me...dance with me!

[Slim:] I can see you over there just chillin' with your girlfriends, can't
believe your by your self you should be here with me, chillin' with me,
drinkin' with me, freakin' with me. Oooohhh whoa, whoa!

[Chorus:]
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
and I really want you to get close to me.
So wont you dance with me...dance with me.
My drop tops in the parking lot
and I wanna take you back to my spot.
but we still got a little more time to rock
So wont you dance with me...dance with me!

[Slim:] I can see it in your eyes that your looking at the time. You wanna
leave this party and I know you wanna leave with me. To chill with me, to
drink with me, to freak with me, oh baby!

[Chorus:]
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
and I really want you to get close to me.
So wont you dance with me...dance with me.
My drop tops in the parking lot
and I wanna take you back to my spot.
but we still have a little more time to rock
So wont you dance with me...dance with me!

[Chorus:]
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
and I really want you to get close to me.
So wont you dance with me...dance with me.
My drop tops in the parking lot
and I wanna take you back to my spot.
but we still got a little more time to rock
So wont you dance with me...dance with me!

[Slim:] Everybody sing along....
[112:] If you sexy and you know it clap your hands
(clap clap-clap...clap, clap clap)
If you sexy and you know it clap your hands

If you sexy and you know it and you really wanna show it,

(clap clap-clap...clap, clap clap)  Yeah!

[Chorus:] (x3-to fade)
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
and I really want you to get close to me.
So wont you dance with me...dance with me.
My drop tops in the parking lot
and I wanna take you back to my spot.
but we still got a little more time to rock
So wont you dance with me...dance with me!
