ALL I WANT IS YOU

2000 112 and we won't stop
'cause we can't stop
No we won't stop 'cause we can't stop
I heard you got plenty of money
Plenty of clothes
An Escalade, a  Porsche and a house on the hills
A platinum watch, a platinum ring, a platinum card
A condo in Beverly Hills and they say that you're a millionaire
But baby I don't really care 'cause I just need for you to see that all I want is you

I heard you got a Gucci vest to match your boots
Versace wear Chanel and Fendi suits
Bubble eyed Benz bubble eyed Lexus coupe
And you make sure your friends are bubble too
They say that you're a millionaire
But baby I don't really care 'cause I just want for you to see that all I want is you baby

(chorus)
All I real-ly want is you
Believe me 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
'cause all I really want is you

I heard you got sexy eyes sexy lips sexy feet you got sex appeal
I love the way you wear your hair the way you dress the way you make me feel
You make me want you more and more
You're everything I'm looking for and I just need for you to see that all I want is you

I love your personality I think that you're all that a woman should be
Like a picture out of a magazine
Or a vision of my wildest dreams
You make me want you more and more
You're everything I'm looking for
And I just need for you to see that all really want is you

Chorus until fade
