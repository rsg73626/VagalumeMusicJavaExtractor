ONLY YOU (CLEAN RADIO MIX)

I need to know
Where we stand
Do we share the special thing called love
I know I do, what about you
I just can't get enough of your time
1 - Where do I go
What do I do
I can't live without your love
Thinking of you
Makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you
2 - Girl I want you
Be with you
No one else
Only you
Why can't we just
Make it happen
Baby I need you in my life
Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart
Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2
Repeat 1
Repeat 2
