POWER OF THE EXCELLENCE

[R.E.U.]
When the R spits that raw it's caution for listeners
To keep they guard up like a talkative prisoner
Uh I don't bargain I enter ya'
Take ya' kicks chain and girl off ya' arm while you kissin' her
Shorty go back home talk to them villager cats
Tell ya' boyfriend that niggaz is wack and I'm the illest at rap
Yeah you know me the menace is back sorry to be an ignorant cat
Triggers is packed secure unlimited caps for war
And what we tuck 'em under huh?
All my niggaz rock fitted and black velour ha! I stay dreamin'
Believe when I get in the game I'm destined to gain freedom
Nah mean? keepin' the block and the streets healthy girl
Ya' husband's gonna cop the Elite LP!
And listen to 16 tracks of that raw
That's givin' him faith that if he gon' step he gettin' cracked in the jaw
I don't give a fuck if he's a villian or gun buster
Aside from you and I in the hilton I'm untouchable

I'll show you how great a great can be
Cuz this is a cat that you just can't see
It's R the untoucha
Yeah nigga it's R the untouchable I'll bum rush ya'
I'll show you how great a great can be
Cuz this is a cat that you just can't see
Cuz I'm a gangster a killer a murderer slash verbalist
Suckers just ain't touchin' the R I'm still a hustler

I'll smack a nigga in his brain for frontin and stain you somethin'
You talkin that shit but ain't gainin' nothin'
I handle ya' flocks on the nightly
Have ya' white tee match ya' Blazers jersey dirty Timbs stomp and you might bleed
Thai weed got me chinky as shit
Both eyes closed I shoot one blink and you miss
Thinkin bout this who the Lord? metaphor sargeant?
Dead a whore if she don't come out her set of drawers marchin'
Naw I'm kiddin the game is wicked
My brain is stickin' up the most gassed dames for digits
I dial 'em on the cell style on 'em and tell 'em what a nigga 'bout
Trips to the nile ride a gazelle
Takin' it foreign with 'em!
Niggaz is wild fuck what he say we chief haze
Jewels in the breifcase guzzlin' brews on the weekdays
New shit irregular music faggots swearin' they've stepped up
I'm a whole stairwell ahead of you stupids

I'll show you how great a great can be
Cuz this is a cat that you just can't see
It's R the untoucha
Yeah nigga it's R the untouchable I'll bum rush ya'
I'll show you how great a great can be
Cuz this is a cat that you just can't see
Cuz I'm a gangster a killer a murderer slash verbalist
Suckers just ain't touchin' the R I'm still a hustler

And all the veterans do shit the way that the R does
Playin' the czar legislate stay in the hard buzz
Ya'll need some raw shit to play up in ya'll club
Fuck you writin' the check I don't cater to false love
I ain't a slave no when I'm walkin' I stay dolo
Cuz niggaz is straight cowards and other's is brave homos
Pesos circulate throughout the fam as well as anger
The stranger that'll shake you out ya' van
Feelin' danger it's R the rawest of spacial creatures
Bottles'll break ya' teeth or remodel ya' facial features
You bumpin my beats? just careful when pluggin' ya' tweeters
And don't get to close unless you tryin' to get sucked through the speakers
Those out of the supernatural can't reach us
Common cats seek us as the army camp teachers
Cult VI - Sin City connect we marvelous
The girls the girls they love us!

I'll show you how great a great can be
Cuz this is a cat that you just can't see
It's R the untoucha
Yeah nigga it's R the untouchable I'll bum rush ya'
I'll show you how great a great can be
Cuz this is a cat that you just can't see
Cuz I'm a gangster a killer a murderer slash verbalist
Suckers just ain't touchin' the R I'm still a hustler
