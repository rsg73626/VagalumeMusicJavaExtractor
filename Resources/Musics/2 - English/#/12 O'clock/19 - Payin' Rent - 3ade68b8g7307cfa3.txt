PAYIN' RENT

[D-Shade]
We bring that hip hop to make your crews flop
And now we striving that much harder to get closer to the top
Up to the apex
Who's next to get swept by dialects
I see that so clearly(?) 'cause you caught up in our vortex
'Til the next time we flip the text and throw down
Rhymes will have to go down on paper, then we're stage bound
Flipping that lingo like a poet had Kedo, or Judo
A Juno, when we chopping with them vocal
Antics and tactics, swinging semantics
Simple schematics that we kicks for the fanatics
Of hip hop, when we drop it's non-stop
We gathering the masses like a farmer picks the crops
I be the empty head filler, microphone guerrilla
And if you see blank ward, then I might have to drillya
Holding your soul, filling it up with the funk
And if the mic was alcohol, then I guess we's getting drunk

CHORUS [D-Shade]
People say they do, but they don't represent
'Cause before you represent, you got to start to pay the rent
People say they do, but they don't represent
Because before you represent, you got to start to pay the rent

[Revolution] (D-Shade)
A shaved head like ??? ???, a step from way back
Check the playback, everything smooth I rhyme through (aight then)
Check the moves, it's to prove we've been here for years
Without tears, like I was Rory, end of story
I read you mind man, just like a CAT scan
Intelligence enhanced, hence expands my mind stance
I'm full faced when I fornicate
I'm never dissing anybody, instead I'm ditching bodies (alright then)
With the vocal cords aided by the larynx
Kind of muffled through the gas mask 'cause your corps stinks
Your vibes have gotten rotten, from sitting in the sun
I am the one who comes raw but well done
Perfected, the funk fest like Beck did
Respected by many as the ones who wrecked it
Collected the rent upon the first because you’re the tenants
In rap, we won the pennant, no rules like bad lieutenant

CHORUS [Revolution] X2

“Life ain’t funny when you got no money”
