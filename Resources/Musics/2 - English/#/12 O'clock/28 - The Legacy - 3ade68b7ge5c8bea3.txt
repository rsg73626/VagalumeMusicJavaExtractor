THE LEGACY

[Hystwise]
Hystwise you know sonnin' niggaz often
double dead one'll shove the gun into your coffin

So sick people saying get well soon

If it's drama I'm a let the thing pop
Skeemo sling rocks like white kids with slingshots

So called starts please seek the principle

Hittin' the snipers VI is priceless my clique's the nicest
