HYSTSCHOOL

[Hystwise]
Instead of a locker got a head with a conscience
Dead or paralyzed a monster is left
Bear in mind instead of teachers it's intellectuallization
A clean logic with exceptional ways
To meddle to with rage and hatred
Like mixin chemicals in beakers that I aim away to blow in someone else's faces
By the way this Clayton and my mind sick
It spreads contagious let's remind them
My private school's patrons of rhymin' fools and viable troops
And liars who don't rely on the truth
There's no such thing as suspension or graduation
Strangled by the line between real and imagination
Hence there's no way to decide if you'd rather make it or die
Try'na break rich hustlin' for my 8 cent
Clayton Hystwise sucker clown we all we got
In my mind where the literature's perverted
As children some wished they lived as a different person
a role model someone to worship so I made mines
Out everything I came by guided by strange life
And anger and a lust for women as well as danger
Fuck a reluctant sinner sonny I'm blatent as hell
Success prone so I'm waitin to fail
Livin' foul in my Hystschool there's no way I'm gettin out
Lookin at a 20 to life its like a prison now

Welcome to Hystschool
Hystschool there's no way I'm gettin' out
Fuck a reluctant sinner sonny I'm blatent
As children break rich hustlin' for my 8 cent
Clayton Hystwise sucker clown we all we got
Welcome to Hystschool
Instead of a locker
A clean logic meddle with rage and hatred
Real and imagination
Livin' foul in my Hystschool
There's no way I'm gettin' out
Lookin' at a 20 to life it's like a prison now
Welcome to Hystschool

Super-ego verse id
Revenge verse Forgive
Good versus Sin
Him versus Him

So thats what this is huh? for cats who never did much
It's somethin' just to sit around dazed and be complacent
And dream some goals yeah I got one I need more
I'm shotgun in peeps ploys and plots for my future
A decoy I'm not the solution
To the problems that I got that's beyond resolution
Niggaz holla what up? Holy shit where'd the doctor come from
He's jottin' on somethin' talkin' 'bout I'm not gonna whaaa???

Well he's not gonna make it
The ward has tried to find the patient
A safe zone and alliance with Clayton
With no avail he's exhibitin'
Emotional distress and dissociative traits
I think his only hope is the state
Mental ward overlookin' his case keepin' him safe
It's sad he made up all the people he hates
Nurse won't you keep him awake and steady talkin'
I'm takin' a break 5 minutes cigarette and coffee you want?
