FRONTLINE

[R.E.U.]
Maaaaaaan what you know about a cat like R?
A dime piece nigga chicks catfight for
My gat strike war begin on the blocks
And got words with any army member or cop
I'll send 'em a shot cuz cult VI cats'll attack
We hit the block til' we can build a castle with crack
No hasslin black I'm mad cuz rappers is wack
Don't mind us culture subtractin' ya' stacks

[Juganot]
We broadcastin' live from the streets where I come
Prepared for beef there's no peace of mind some
Believe the Desert E's relieves the problems
And if that's the case then let's get it poppin'
Juganot killin' 'em breakin' 'em off proper
The next big thing since Pun And Big Poppa
So big when I walk in a room it gets darker
I'm soon to be a household name just like Martha
Stewart and Bill Cosby and Bob Barker
The crew is Culture VI and type bonkers
Juganot tougher than Tonka the monster
Eatin' the tracks alive divide and conquer

[Brolik]
D O S dead on sight whenever we meet
Wanted for murder what'd you do? I done killed another beat
Ash that before you pass that what is you doin'?
Throw some spit on the tip of the spliff prevent the canoeing
Culture VI introducin' I'll take care of the lyrics you handle the producin'
Let's be realistic I ain't feelin' them they too simplistic
I'll subtract you and add somethin' different listen

[SixXx]
Collosal crews are crumblin' mumblin' mouths is runnin' and
No matter how you look at it nothin' amounts to nothin' and
Not a lot of rhymers wanna try to put on a facade of maraudin'
Oh shit the heart of the squadron
Gotta barrage of marksman as large as the Partridge
Rippin' bone flesh and arteries discardin' the carcass
Part of the squad is heartless and parts obnoxious
Throwin' fists to the sky knockin' gods unconcious

[Kas]
When it comes to beer I'm a Beck that guns I'm a Tech that
Beef I'm a check that set that and wet that
Puss I'm a wreck that gamble we can bet that
Raise me met that lose I collect that
Tools I can get that rules don't respect that
Cars I'm a Lex that but only GS that
Chrome BBS that dough we don't stress that
Hoes we don't sweat that foes we address that
Go where ya' rest at Fours where ya' chest at
Holes where ya' vest at roll with the best cats

[Bugz]
Who's that??? Who's that?

[Culture VI]
CULTURE VI!

[Chorus: Hystwise]
Yo, You want war then you got it
C V I be Frontline with guns in our pockets
You want war then it's over for you
We got soldiers with tools that's focused on you
You want war then you got it
C V I be frontline with guns in our pockets
You want war then it's over for you
We got soldiers with tools that's focused on you

[Skeemo]
Check this out right here..
Maaan... I put the guns down we can do it with the fists
I ain't the barber shop I can still get you clipped
Got a gauge behind the stove keep a tool in the room
Niggaz had you up north washin' Fruit of the Looms
Dirty underwear cleaner comin' home try'na act meaner
Ya' nickname in Attica was Tina
Try'na act tough'll only leave ya' eye crooked
Gimme the crack and tell ya' boss I took it
Titanium vest up under the shirt pussy
I see that maxi pad under your skirt
Don't try to hide your dress get hit with 25 or less
Have the surgeons inside your chest

[Poizon Vaporz]
You Know it be P V itchy to bang when I'm venting my steam
Cuz all I shoot is my age and I M-16
If you rappin' and you heard me and you happen to disturb me
Quick to react with the mack and turn your jacket to a jersey
And just to get smacked or clapped you know it's no prob
With recliner gats that kick back and take a load off
So chill out you want war ofcourse it's a certainty
With chainsaws to take your brain off in gang surgery

[Radius]
Ya'll rookie ass niggaz I'm ripping these lames fuck this
With your wack I need to get in the game punches
Pollutin' these faggots put two in these rappers
The emcee Spielberg when I'm shootin' these actors
Bet a knife can make a pool of blood rise from your flesh
Makin' it easier for these bullets to dive in your chest
Killin' niggaz with a dirty weapon
Keep talkin' we can fight and shoot the fair one plus 37
Ya' boy sick I don't wanna breath on ya'
So please leave 'fore the snub nose sneeze on ya'
You can do a bid for a kid for a crime
And you still couldn't serve a fuckin' sentence of mines

[Clowd9yne]
Release enough anger my common sense
In this rap tracks get to a point I touch danger
I'm underground archeoligists can learn from this
Watch this like Fossil watches'll stop clocks in my force it's
Forewarnin' precautions eat beef on ya' block no spoons street forks in
Peep often see me the heats all sick
You'll see coffins beat off ya' C 4 bricks

[Bugzy Bogart]
It's pretty rare you see me form an alliance
I keep my palm on an appliance in case I get warned by the sirens
Bogart got the heart of a lion seen my Moms cryin'
When I got stabbed and she thought I was dyin'
Ever since I've been sort of a tyrant
Gargamel – had ‘em sparkin' els for they lost men and orphans
And I spit too sick for walkmans and all that tough shit you talkin'? Shit
I should send you my hollow tips cuz they rip through organs
Keyboards pianos it's T. Soprano
it's too much heat to handle
It's Culture - 6 thousand degrees for vandals

[Chorus: Hystwise]
You want war then you got it
C V I be frontline with guns in our pockets
You want war then it's over for you
We got soldiers with tools that's focused on you
You want war then you got it
C V I be frontline with guns in our pockets
You want war then it's over for you
We got soldiers with tools that's focused on you
You want war then you got it
C V I be frontline with guns in our pockets
You want war then it's over for you
We got soldiers with tools that's focused on you
