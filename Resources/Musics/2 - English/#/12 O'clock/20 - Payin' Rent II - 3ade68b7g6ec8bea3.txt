PAYIN' RENT II

[D-Shade: talking]
Enter the station, the lyrical devestation
Wack MC annihilation and termination
Hey hey, watch this now
[Rapping]
Standing strong like foundation, making moves in combination
And yo the one who sets ???????? like sedation
It's the dread, knocking suckers out like Sudafed
Crush the oppostion because they got me seeing red
They getting me madder
than Doc. Banner when he's in his altered state
At rapid rates I circulate to make the fakes disinegrate
Retaliate with forces from the subterrainian
In hostile situations I'm aiming at your cranium
So heads up, you might get cut when we erupt
And when they ask, you can tell them hard was how I struck
The demolition team is demolishing, so caution
Is recommended when you up against the awesome
Individual shining like jewels
Better pay your rents and dues
'cause we sharper than Shinobi Ninja tools
Severing nerve endings up inside this hip-hop body
Do like we do for credit cards, destroy the carbon copy

CHORUS: D-Shade
Yo, we about to make this evident
We all up in here so you know we paid our rent
Yo, I'm out to make this evident
I'm all up in this, so you know I paid my rent
(REPEAT)

[Kandu]
Why. You try to find the right lie
But, you're wasting everbody's time while you're posing
I'm cool and slow with plenty of precision
Emmaculate dark vocal box
I live on the perimeter, on the South Shore, Mount Rushmore
I'm mad like Zulu language
But you understand me perfetly, It's Kandu
Supreme fuckin Kahn, I'm all eight(?) raise
My following: each one teach one
My name is on their brain and my name reigns
Ring the alarm, another fucking sound done dead
Romance and finance the legend
You go on the job, run the fucking errands
Playa-haters, snake fakes and devils tonight
You will be no more, yesterday it was the eve of destruction
Who next in line for the crushin'

CHORUS: Kandu
Yo, we about to make shit evident
We all up in here so you know we paid our rent
Yo, we about to make it evident
We all up in this so you know we paid our rent
Yo, we about to make it evident
We all up in here so you know we paid our rent
Yo, Scales Empire, Shades of Culture
You know, we done paid our rent

[Revolution]
Head shaved like Telle, Savalis on your tele
Vision and everything I ting I rhyme proficient
Check this style,
I compile herbs and verbs with no words from competition
Sit back and listen
Cut out your spine man like psyco cat scan
Rap skills and ?? I expend your best friends
I see through you like stencils
I'm sharpening pencils
for all the battles that we waged on instrumentals
With the vocals cords aided by the larnyx
Kind of muffled through the mic because you fucking cuffed it
Your rhymes have gotten rotten
Before you got shot,
the dance hall fans have all taken a switch stance
Perfected in opposite reaction, traction needed to grip
Run through class on your mic clip
Pay your taxes the the governor
And if you didn't pay your dues
The crew's coming through and roughing ya

CHORUS:Revolution
Yo, we about to make this evident
We all up in here so you know we paid our rent
Yo, we about to make this evident
We all up in here so you know we paid our rent
(REPEAT)

"aw yeah" (Scratched up)

"yeah, ha ha" (Scratched up)

[D-Shade: talking]
Yes, this goes out to all the people
out in N.D.G. F.R.I.T.Z. Each and
every hip-hop community. And yeah keep it on the real
