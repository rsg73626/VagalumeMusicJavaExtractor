SALUTE

[Intro: Lounge Lo] 
Ya'll know the work, aiyo 
Go get all the guns out the muthafucking car, man 
Word up, cuz these niggas gon' survive 
Fuck all of ya'll... 

[Chorus: Lounge Lo] 
Where my thugged out cats with bands around they ankles 
Paizon niggas/goombah dogs with diamonds in they bangles 
Pinky rings and benzito, sippin' wino, the booze 
Centi an', ah salute 

[Lounge Lo] 
I'm in the middle of some beef in the streets of Bensonhurst 
And if I see a cop first, dog, I'mma pop first 
I'mma do, son, Amadu, Clinton do 
Some live shit, even the realest niggas they wouldn't do 
Babyface and Tommy and them, Uncle Jinny 
Louie teasing Little Johnny and them, gangsta 
Gangsta shit, fucking with the livest, nigga 
It's O.T.F., muthafucker, street survivor nigga 
Jimmy Two Time, stutter it up, I buckle it up 
Talk with my hand on my mouth, cover it up 
See the light from Marty Z., over a Cola 
He said son was out there, and look over my shoulder 
Chill mama, I was only known for Lounging 
But never drama, tell me some more, tell me some more 
What do you believe, heaven or hell? 
Lounge Beneen, check out the style beneen 
Italiano black boys come to crowd the scene 
Yo Stub, get the joint so we can plan and interrupt 
And tell, Johnny Mack to meet back at the hub 
Turtle, Dove, call Clock at the lab 
Franky Botts is coming over with the digital bag 

[Molly-Q] 
Where my stubbed out cats with gats up on they ankle 
Hoster, see me on the poster, I'm on it 
Chunk of marijuana, silent and the violent 
Starch and the Armor, keep it full armored 
Godfather slang, do hits and stay honored 
Why bother, you don't want the drama, cause trauma 
Center of attraction in your wife's pajama 
New York clean farmer, tent to tent rhymer 
Parked in the Hill, in the cut, in the Harbor 
Give me, cross the map, compact your daily contract 

[Chorus 2X] 

[Shawn Wigs] 
Aiyo, Botts, we like Superfly and Sammartino 
I'mma bottle of the Henny, feel San Pellegrino 
I'm great like Constantino, thug genoli's 
Flavors, packed with the shrimp raviolis 
Smoked and Caponed up, twist the braids back 
Put the TV's on in the heads of the Cadillac 
Escalade, 1.4.0. beats be the escapade 
More escapades, twist leafs of the best grenade 

[Franky Botts] 
My road dogs, slow jack on they ankles 
And all my tephlons, with diamonds in they bangles 
Will and Nino, they wanna know who fits the biz 
Known as Soprano, smuggling cases of Hector Harmano 
Lounge and Nino, it's Othorized, it's your time 
Commando code of silence, all the time 
Cappachino, bon appetit, it's goombah 
We sitting at the table where the Benino's eat 
La Familia, bulked up like Ray Aginero 
The Jesus, our sign is worth dope like Picasso 
Iced out, prio ditto, Franky Botts 
Go live pics on America's Most 
And my whole in-the-loop family off the boat 
Springfield, land field, break bread, Catskill 
The clue-londo, sippin' sapphire Pompei 
Running up in they land, clean they ass out like for days 
Ship out to echo, Francesco perfecto 
Crucify the rhyme like Jesus, lead up on the poor 
We hold the mic so tight, so families put your glasses up high 
And cent anni', ah salute, a hundred years Othorized 

[Chorus]
