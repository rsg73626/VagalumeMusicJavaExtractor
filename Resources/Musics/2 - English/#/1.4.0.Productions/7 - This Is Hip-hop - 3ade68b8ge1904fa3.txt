THIS IS HIP-HOP

[Hook: King Just singing] 
Hey yo, you got mad flow, you gon' get dough 
Light that endo (Come on say it again!) 
Hey yo, you got mad flow (You know you got it!) 
You gon' get dough, light that endo (Come on say it again!) 

[King Just] 
You done lit dynamite on Mr. Excite 
You been rappin' for a long time and don't sound right 
Not quite as the hype that you recite 
Mr. All Day, I do it to ya ass all night 
On sight, I smash anything you write 
With canine teeth for niggas who back-bite 
Walk to the light and bring ya mic 
You won't last one minute in a ten round fight 
The Al Qaeda type that'll snipe ya windpipe 
And seize ya General and strip him of his stripes 
Either you men or mice you gon' still pay the price 
So take my advice and roll the dice 
Real life, still trife 
Walk with a gun, talk with a knife 
Double CD so you could buy me twice, hold tight! 
And you just might take flight 
MC's got left while you think they not right 
Hang-glide like a kite on the turnpike 
with two bad bitches that suck Dick Van Dyke 
Pay per view satellite is a need to feed my appetite 
Pick up ya weight cuz you ain't got the hype 
Battle me? You need an invite, black or white 
And I still drink a 40 with Ike 
I still smoke a Lee joint from Spike, aight? 
I'm the reason why Coca Cola gonna have to fuckin' remix the Sprite 
He's nice! And safe like Chinese rice 
If I'm the shit on the stick, you the baby wipes 
You the Latter Day Saints, I'm the Poltergeists 
I'm the whole damn pie, nigga, you just a slice 
This is a heist, I suggest you remove ya ice 
before you be Up Close and Personal with Christ 
Get on ya Big Wheel bike and take a hike 
cuz around these parts, you not liked 
Parasite, don't have me flex my mic 
I don't rock Air Force 1's, I call air strikes 

[Chorus: King Just] 
This is Hip-Hop, this is who I am 
You think I really give a damn? (Get 'em!) 
Cuz we here to stay, KJ, man, I'm on my way 
(Now everybody say..) This is Hip-Hop, this is who I am 
Do you think I really give a damn? 

[King Just] 
Listen here, pioneer, lemme make things clear 
Any cosmic rappers I'll blow out the atmosphere 
We are Borg and we came to assimilate 
Violate, annihilate, vindicate and get it straight 
And once and for all, I'll give it to y'all 
And shit on ya name like a bathroom stall 
Number 1 draft pick without the b-ball 
And the bigger they come, the harder they fall 
If I was in ya era I'd still be a terror 
The only nigga that could beat me is standin' in the mirror 
You'd hear me clearer without the interferer 
If I was in the woods fightin' a bear, help the bear 
He's what's up! And you? You not 
Ya old school like Rocky Johnson, I'm more like The Rock 
The people's eyebrow, the people's elbow 
If anyone fuck with the Just, hell no! 

[Hook x2 w/ ad-libs] 

[Outro: King Just] 
Told y'all, KJ, everyday, all day 
Around ya way, in ya hallway, puffin' John Jay 
You see me say?
