HARSH REALITY

On my knees again, A conflict paven sidewalk,
Has torn my pants of reason.
'Cause you don't want a part of me,
And I don't want a part of truth.

Got to give reality,
Reality, reality,
A chance I know. Yes, I do.
Got to give reality,
Reality, reality,
A chance I know. Yes, I...

...Want to leave again;
This hatred room built of deceit,
Has bruised my hands for feeling.
'Cause you don't want a part of me,
And I don't want a part of truth.

Got to give reality,
Reality, reality,
A chance I know. Yes, I do.
Got to give reality,
Reality, reality,
A chance I know. Yes, I...

Yes I know, this pain inside my heart,
Won't you let me take away.
Then I saw your face as I walked away.
Never tried so hard; always feel I failed.
I never knew that love could be this hard.
There's nothing wrong with what I'm saying.
Nothing wrong with me...

Yes I know, this pain inside my heart,
Won't you let me take away.
Then I saw your face as I walked away.
Never tried so hard; always feel I failed.
Never knew that love could be this harsh.
There's nothing wrong with what I'm saying.
Nothing wrong with me...

Harsh reality...
Oh yeah,
Harsh reality...

Never tried so hard; I always feel I failed.
I never knew that love could be this hard.
There's nothing wrong with what I'm saying.
Nothing wrong with me...

I want to live.
I want to die.
Tell me there's nothing wrong,
So I'll just go away.
I'm going away.
I'm going away.
I'm going away.

Harsh reality...
Oh yeah,
Harsh reality...
