7 HOURS LESS TOMORROW

Violence rules my world,
When I can't come to terms with what I've done.

Smiled as if you cared,
Remembered feeling so use to this,
That I'd sing myself to sleep at night,
Separated only by the miles that stand between as days go by.

The more I cry as my sins are shown:
They're my way of knowing where to go.
Got to lie sometimes along the way,
Got so high that I wished it all away:
The more I cry as my sins are shown.

My violence surrounds me,
Carves the world out around me,
And settles me,
'Cause I'm never falling in love.

Suicide comes to mind.
Well, I can't pull the plug and end my life.

Smiled as if you cared,
Remembered feeling so use to this,
That I'd sing myself to sleep at night,
Separated only by the miles that stand between as days go by.

The more I cry as my sins are shown:
They're my way of knowing where to go.
Got to lie sometimes along the way,
Got so high that I wished it all away.
The more I cry as my sins are shown:
My violence surrounds me.

My violence surrounds me,
Carves the world out around me,
And settles me,
'Cause I'm never falling...

My violence surrounds me,
Carves the world out around me,
And settles me,
'Cause I'm never falling in love.
'Cause I'm never falling in love.
Never falling in love...
Never falling in love...
