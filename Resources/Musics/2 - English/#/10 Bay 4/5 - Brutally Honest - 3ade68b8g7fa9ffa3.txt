BRUTALLY HONEST

I can't stomach the words you said:
The blame you cast down upon my friend.
If I had the chance to meet you...
If I had the chance to meet you...
Christ.

Nothing feels the same:
Like it use to be.
Blame has now become,
My new best friend.
All the things that I would like to say,
Haven't gone.

You showed no remorse
Toward his family:
Couldn't shut your mouth and let them grieve.
Had to show your kids off like a trophy.
Had to show your kids off like a trophy.

Nothing feels the same:
Like it use to be.
Blame has now become,
My new best friend.
All the things that I would like to say,
Haven't gone to waste.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change,
The courage to change the things I can,
And the wisdom to know,
The difference.

Poor me!
Poor me!
Poor me!
Poor me...

Nothing feels the same:
Like it use to be.
Blame has now become,
My new best friend.
All the things that I would like to say,
Haven't gone to waste.
