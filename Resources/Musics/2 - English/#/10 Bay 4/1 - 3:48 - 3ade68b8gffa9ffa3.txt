3:48

You would limp on a break
If it got you where you meant
It would hurt thirsts of love
But you like the way it tastes
Without air walked a mile
Toward the other man's land
Sell the souls of my shoes
Now they all fall down

If found I'm lost
Watch me closely
When day returns
Trifled like a cure
If I could I would
Hold my breath and close my eyes
I'm invisible to the world around me
When I'm here with you
I'm invincible to the world around me
Breathe you in to draw you near
Touch something familiar
We're both sad and lonely

Imagined lies that were truth
Brought it by a different view
Sailed it high drifted white
Winded by the cumulous cry
Forward sense to shallows deep
Correct to justify the means
Sell the souls of my shoes
Now they all fall down

If found I'm lost
Watch me closely
When day returns
Trifled like a cure
If I could I would
Hold my breath and close my eyes
I'm invisible to the world around
When I'm here with you
I'm invincible to the world around me
Breathe you in to draw you near
Touch something familiar
We're both sad and lonely

If I could I would
Hold my breath and close my eyes
I'm invisible to the world around
When I'm here with you
I'm invincible to the world around me
If I would I could
Hold my breath and close my eyes
I'm invisible to the world around me
Breathe you in to draw you near
Touch something familiar
We're both sad and lonely
