BRAD'S SONG

"Looks like I'm drifting farther away.
Looks like I'm falling farther away.
Looks like I'm running farther away,"
He said...

"Just the other day, I thought that it'd be ok,
But I don't feel the same today.
I'm starting to heal the pain again,
With a bottle that's in my hands.
Looks like I'm falling farther away,"
He's said.

"Wish it's the last time,
But sometimes it's like there's no other way.
When no one's there to walk you through it,
Silence stalks me; there's no improvement.
I'll jump this time, no bruises.
Now I'm falling farther away,"
He's said.

"Pain in my soul, I don't need this no more.
I am waiting for you;
Now, I'm waiting for me.
Pain in my soul, I don't need this no more.
I am waiting for you;
Now I'm waiting for me."

"Pain: in my soul, in my soul.
Pain: in my soul, in my soul."
