REVERSE

I don't want to know,
What you're thinking.
I don't care; I don't even care, even care.
I don't want to know; I don't want to know.
I don't want to see; I don't want to see.
No one wants to fear; no one wants to fear,
Anything, anything...

I'm left wondering,
Was there any pain at all,
In my eyes?
And I see and I see,
Where we're going, where we're going,
But she's the only one for me.

The meaning of this life,
Tells me I'm wrong,
When I'm having trouble letting go,
'Cause everywhere I turn, I think I see,
You, but you're not there.
Nothing makes sense anymore,
'Cause no prayer I pray can bring you back to me.

I don't want to know,
What you're thinking,
'Cause I'm not, as strong as you.
I belong listening to your voice,
As soft as an angel's,
Whispering, into my ears of pain,
'Cause I'm already listening for the words you say.
No, I'm not going away;
You cannot be that far away.
Well I'm left wondering,
Was there any pain at all,
And how I'd get this far away?
And I see, and I see,
Where we're going, where we're going,
But she's the only one for me.
