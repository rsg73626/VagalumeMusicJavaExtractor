FACED

Why's the question I'm left with everyday,
When so many lies, so many lies, so many lies, come out to torture me.
Tried to think what I would say to you,
But somebody lied, somebody lied, somebody lied... somebody lied to me

Why's the question I'm left with everyday.
(We were freedom; we were freedom; we we're freedom.)
Tried to think what I would say to you,
But somebody lied, somebody lied, somebody lied... somebody lied to me

On a beach...
(We were freedom; we were freedom; we were freedom)
God I guess told you, that He had other plans.
Sure we thought we'd live forever;
But now, we know things change

Why's the question I'm left with everyday,
When so many lies, so many lies, so many lies, come out to torture me.
Tried to think what I would say to you,
But somebody lied, somebody lied, somebody lied, somebody lied...

(We were freedom; we were freedom;
We were freedom; we were freedom; we were freedom.)

Why's the question I'm left with everyday,
When so many lies, so many lies, so many lies, come out to torture me.
Tried to think what I would say to you,
But somebody lied, somebody lied, somebody lied,
Somebody lied...

We were freedom...

We were freedom...

We were freedom...
We were freedom, we were freedom...

Why?

Why?

Why'd you leave me alone,
All alone?
Why?
'Cause we were freedom
'Cause we were freedom
On a beach...
I'm sad.
