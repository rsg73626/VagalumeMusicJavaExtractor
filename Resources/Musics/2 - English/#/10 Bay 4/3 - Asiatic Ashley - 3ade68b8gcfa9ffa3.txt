ASIATIC ASHLEY

Asiatic Ashley, why don't you talk to me?
Must it always be this way?
Must it always feel the same?
Must it always feel?

What, is something wrong with me?
What did I do to you,
That makes you feel so strange?
Sown incomplete
Sown incomplete

I feel I've been let down;
I'm tired on my own.
'Cause I am so angry, you saved me.
So angry, I am; I am.
Said I am; said I am...

It seemed to be the best thing at the time; forget,
The reasons why we ever, ever went this far.
And, for this reason, you must understand,
How I feel when I hit your wall.

Fear blinded me, like it blinded you.
Fear blinded me, like it blinded you.

I feel I've been let down;
I'm tired on my own.
'Cause I am so angry, you saved me.
So angry, I am; I am.
Said I am; said I am...
