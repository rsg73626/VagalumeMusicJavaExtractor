READING YOUR FABLES

I've been searching
I've been hiding
Like a pilgrim
New sun rising
I've been drowning in your river
Trying to be a true believer
I've been reading all your fables
Turning over every table
Making peace with cain & abel
Somehow I still feel unstable

But I can' t lie, your truth lives in my heart
And I'm not blind I see one face in the dark

I was digging
I was dreaming
Crucifying every meaning
Tightrope walking on cathedrals
Acrobatics over hell
I was kneeling on my altar
But your termites have good teeth
And when you silenced all my parties
Me and Judas kept on dancing
