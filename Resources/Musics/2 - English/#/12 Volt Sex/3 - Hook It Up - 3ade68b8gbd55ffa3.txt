HOOK IT UP

Every time I give a little bit
Seems you wanna take a lot of it
I'm just wishing I'd get through to you
Now won't you tell me what you wanna do

Cuz I can't go on like this no more
You come walking through my door

Hey, you wanna hook it up
You never say enough
And I can't figure out
Just what your all about
I need to understand
Are you in my future plans
Or just a one night stand
Come on and let me know

Cuz you're giving me more...

Everytime I get inside of you
Seems it changes your whole attitude
All I really want is just to talk
Now which direction are you gonna walk

Cuz I can't go on like this no more
You come walking through my door

Hey, you wanna hook it up
You never say enough
And I can't figure out
Just what your all about
Done everything I can
To be your superman
Yeah I'm your biggest fan
Come on and let me know

Cuz your giving me more
Everytime that I want some
Yeah your giving me more

All I really want is to lay gently down beside you
That's the part I miss the most of all
After she left me
And maybe it's not fair to touch your hair
& think about her
But I know no other way to ease the pain & heartache

Forget about it...

Hey you wanna hook it up
You never say enough
And I can't figure out
Just what you're all about
I need to understand
Am I in your future plans
Or just a one-night stand
Come on and let me know

You wanna hook it up
You never say enough
And I can't figure out
Just what you're all about
Done everything I can
To be your superman
Yeah I'm your biggest fan
Come on and let me know

You wanna hook it up
You never say enough
And I can't figure out
Just what you're all about
Done everything I can
To be your superman
Yeah I'm your biggest fan
Come on and let me know
