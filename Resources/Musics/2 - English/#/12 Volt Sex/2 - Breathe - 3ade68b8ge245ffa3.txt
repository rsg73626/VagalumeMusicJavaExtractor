BREATHE

You would do it with anyone
And not even care less
You would keep it from everyone
Saving every breath

Takin' it all the way (x3)
I couldn't breathe (x4)

I'm in love with a criminal
Taking all of my shit
Giving it to the enemy
With out any of it

Takin' it all the way (x3)
I couldn't breathe (x4)

How could you say, you'd love me forever
Now your fucking around
How could you say, you'd need me forever
Now that the damage is done
How could you say, how could you say

I couldn't breathe (x4)
