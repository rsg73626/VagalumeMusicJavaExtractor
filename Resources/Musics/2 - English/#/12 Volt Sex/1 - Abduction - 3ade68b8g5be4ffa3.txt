ABDUCTION

I've been waiting all my life
For the grave to show some sign
That they are coming back for me
To take me with them

And when they crash into my house
I will lose all of my doubt
When they come into my room
Well I will greet them

Cause I've been waiting all my life
Take me with you
(x2)

I hope the paralyze my legs
Expect resistence but I'll beg
Send the phazers, level six
And take me with them

And dressed in spacey styles galore
I bet they'll take me on a tour
Of the entire universe
Yeah, even venus

Cause I've been waiting all my life
Take me with you
(x2)

Then we're goina die for everyone
And I wish I was right here to the sun
But even though well I have tried
To let go

I've been waiting all my life
For the grave to show some sign
That they are coming back for me
To take me with them

Cause ive been waiting all my life
Take me with you
(x2)
