THE END NEVER COMES (INGLÃŠS)

I am still coming and going by groping.
Because it is the middle of the way.
There are many things I would like to share with you.
Times, musics, words, thoughts, among other things.
I am ready, are you ready? If I don't kill any possibilities myself.
I know I can do anything I want to do.
If you don't want it, the end never comes.
