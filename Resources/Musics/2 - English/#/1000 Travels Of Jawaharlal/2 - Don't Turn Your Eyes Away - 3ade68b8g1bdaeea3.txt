DON'T TURN YOUR EYES AWAY

Things go crazy. I am confused and don't know what is right or wrong.
At least, it is not right for me what you say and do.
Things go worse. I am confused and don't know what is right or wrong.
At least, it is not you that is in pain and in trouble.
Don't tour your eyes away. I can't believe you.
The truth can't be seen, so I can't accept you.
