THERE IS NOTHING

I feel boredom here, and I feel pain in my heart.
But I can't decide what I should do and time passes.
I think I will rot. I understand it. I understand it.
However, I want to do somehow or other.
Clearly, I do somehow or other.
Right, I want to shake off this feeling of being blocked.
I know what I should do. I don't look back and just start running.
Hey a lot of things have started now.
I know what I should do. I don't look back and just start running.
