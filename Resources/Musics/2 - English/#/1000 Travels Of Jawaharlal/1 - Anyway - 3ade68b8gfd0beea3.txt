ANYWAY

I consider many things in my head. I want to do this or that.
But, I kept thinking and thinking, and I did nothing.
I did nothing, nobody blames to me. But I think of myself that I am not that great.
It is easy to make it in some causes... but.
Simply, I do what I can do. Anyway, I do little by little.
Don't get impatient. Anyway, I only do what I can at my own pace.
