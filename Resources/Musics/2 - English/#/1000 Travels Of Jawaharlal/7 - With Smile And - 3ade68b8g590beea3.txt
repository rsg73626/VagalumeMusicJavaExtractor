WITH SMILE AND

You seem always to look for something reassure you.
You buy what everybody buys, you sing what everybody sings.
However, why do you always feel so uneasy? Why do you always have a fake smile?
You seem to always be following something afraid to miss anything.
You say what everybody says, you do what everybody does.
However, why do you always feel so uneasy? Why do you always Have a fake smile?
And you get new pressure. It's just repetition.
You know you do the bent smile, you know you are awkward.
Do you want to be with a true good smile?
I want to be with a true good smile.
