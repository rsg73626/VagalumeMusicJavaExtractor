DADDY

I got a rolodex of Cadillacs 10,000 
Motherfuckin' macks rat a tat tat on the tracks 
Go the gats pop pop and they drop crooked cops 
Hear the shots pulling out all the stops 
While collecting mad props gotta ride it like a Caddy 
While your girl calls me daddy gonna party with Bacardi 
Gettin' loose you know we're naughty 
Pass the forty and the blunt I'm not a stuntman 
Look into my eyes and realize I am the one who can flow 
You know these waves as deep as the ocean 
And my cuts with unified were baptised in commotion 
Got this potion called game jumpin' out of my pores 
And if the mind is a weapon then my rhyme is a sword 
So all aboard the soul train these dice that I roll 
Man are comin' up kid I'm the one they call No-Name 
You can't see me in the shadows 
And when it comes to battle I'm Cadillac backed 9,999 prime time 
When we rhyme five dollar dime on the mind 
Make you stop look and listen and you'll still be missing mine 
I'm rollin' with the crown on my hood 
Good wood with a Louisville Slugger motherfucker 
Fuck around say hey batter batter watch a motherfucker splatter 
When I hear your teeth chatter makes this motherfucker madder 
Nigga got more game than Chutes and Ladders 
Had enough so ruff so tuff get your hands against the wall 
I'll call your motherfuckin' bluff now puff some herb 
You look disturbed left you layin' in the curb 
Nigga lost in my verb victimized by my word 
If you bring this you better mean this 
I drop genius at my convenience and your nigga never saw me 
So I know you'll never see this creepers 
Peeps in my click deep in this shit since the day we were born 
And we'll bounce if you trip not down with a stick 
Automatic got a crown on the horn 
Cadillac haters try to fade us motherfuckers 
Got dropped had to say later to the traitors 
Cause that shit had to stop Cleveland's my spot 
Props and peeps beats bump in Jeeps jump in clubs 
10 K's creatin' a name throwin' game showin' love showin' 
Love baby be my Caddy I'll call you Daddy Cadillac Daddy
Cadillac Catch 22 right through ya 
Booya rest in peace it was nice when I knew ya 
Strictly business don't let it fool ya closed casket 
That shit just blew ya mind away 
Find away bring it all back pack the skills you lack 
Ya need a little focus hocus pocus 
Abracadabra I'll grab you when I choke this microphone 
Al Capone rat a tat tat what's up with that
That hocus pocus choke this microphone 
Mad Max kickin' ass beyond the Thunderdome 
Sip a cool forty trip while I rip and tear 
Leggo my Eggo like Prego 
We're in there like Energizer goin' goin' gone so long 
Down with U.C. so forth and so on 
I want it want it want it does that mean I can't have it 
Pull a rhyme out of my mind like pulling that rabbit out of a hat 
Ain't that kind of strange the vocal line rearranged 
But the beat didn't change 
Order in the court cooperate for a quarter 
And you oughta realize we ride and bring disorder transporters crossing borders 
Life is short and getting shorter 
Sex and lies and camcorders order a whiskey and a water 
Raise a toast to Bone for bringing it home to the Erie shores 
See the world got shown where you're at 
When you are from Cleveland we're breathing and achieving 
We're thuggin' but never thieving 
You were deceiving yourself when you thought we weren't 
Shit I got my click not a clip got a crew not a grip 
10,000 Cadillacs coming stacked and equipped 
This is Cleveland motherfucker this is Cleveland 
This is Cleveland motherfucker this is Cleveland
