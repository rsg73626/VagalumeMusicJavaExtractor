WHAT THE FUTURE BRINGS

What the future brings I'm waiting in the wings 
I sing of kings and queens 
But they don't mean as much as the streets do 
You know what I mean? 
Step up step up and speak your mind 
I got my Caddy crown cause I'm down 
For mine now it's 1999 so you know we gotta party 
Raise your forty if you're naughty 
If you feel me join my army 
Gotta bomb 'em with this track 
It's trauma that we pack 
Mad drama Cadillacs got that karma coming back 
So avenge the souls cause it's revenge that we hold in the highest regard 
We praise the gods of old so let go of my style 
You stole three cards and you fold 
Motherfucker don't you know Cadillacs broke the mold 
Hands up it's a hold up you never should of showed up 
Cadillacs plot and rock the block 
Until it blows up back to the top drop 
Game plan can't you tell we're gettin' tired of the same old thing 
Man check it out we're coming up for a take down 
And ol boy is 'bout to buckle under breakdown 
Stand up if you're down take a look to the future 
This generation gap can't be sewn with a suture 
So step off the toes of those that you stand on 
Looks like you're fallin' off without a damn thing to land on 
History repeats itself society defeats itself 
And egos won't allow us to learn from our conceited self esteem 
Is what it is that we gotta take back if they hit ya 
And they hurt ya hit back make an impact 
We're rollin' with the punches and we're takin' our swings 
And we're waitin' in the wings for what the future brings 
I'm waiting in the wings 
I sing of kings and queens 
But they don't mean as much as the streets do 
You know what I mean? 
Bring that funkcore once more dunk and score 
A deuce how loose is your interpretation of a truce 
No pause for the catch up cause the rhythm never lets up 
Searchin' for the truth yeah the youth have got their heads up 
Eyes wide minds open taken down the narrow like Beretta 
You betta keep your eyes on the sparrow 
Return of the dragon heir to the throne 
And with the microphone we're gonna reunite the home 
Team is the key contradictory to belief 
Believe that team equals victory 
Now lock it in the pocket and let the rhythm roll 
Hit play on the machine and let the home team flow 
Cause we're jumpin' out the box 
Got 'em fat and for the kill waitin' in the cut 
Just to kick 'em in the grill
