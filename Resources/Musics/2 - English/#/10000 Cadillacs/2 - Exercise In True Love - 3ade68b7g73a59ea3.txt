EXERCISE IN TRUE LOVE

My heart broke for the last time last night 
When I saw her disappear into the moonlight chasing midnight 
As I sat paging through the newspaper reading about who's at war with who? 
Who's lying to who? who's beating who? 
I reached for my cup of coffee 
As black as the minds of men and the hearts of women 
And I felt an uncontrollable emptiness. 
I looked up and through the glass window 
Hazy with a blanket of industry 
When suddenly the most beautiful woman appeared 
Like a cherub familiar yet strange. 
I felt as if I knew her as well as my own secrets
Yet I knew nothing. 
I felt an urge to jump out of my seat and hold her 
Then I realized a beauty of this magnitude 
Need not be tarnished by the expectations of another 
Nor could she ever again be what she was to me 
At that very moment an ounce of faith 
For a soul drunk with apathy. 
It's strange how we instinctively 
Attempt to alter what we love 
Often spawning the antithesis of its own incarnate. 
This masochistic ignorance defines our species 
And will ultimately lead to our demise. 
As for my love outside that window 
Untainted she walks alone. 
I hope you know 
I hope you know that I love you for 
Forever and when forever never comes 
You'll be in my arms together-together-forever-forever 
We are one 
We are one
