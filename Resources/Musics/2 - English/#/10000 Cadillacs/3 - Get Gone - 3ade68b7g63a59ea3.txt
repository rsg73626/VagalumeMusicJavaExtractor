GET GONE

All the player haters trying to block my game 
All those fakers making paper off of my name 
All the babies killing babies on the playground 
All the static on the street you got to stay down 
Run up and test me try to arrest me 
Better have wore a vest P-O-L-I-C-E I see me beatin' the case coppin' 
No please I bought the jury hurry up and catch up what's up
You know it never lets up and if it gets you down 
Put on the crown now get your heads up 
I got my wing tips don't need a grip to collect my chips 
Forty sip equipped not to trip as I pimp the apocalypse off the rip 
And on the rise see through the messiahs lies 
Got to silence all the cries the destruction and the demise 
We try to make it better make some cheddar make some cheese 
Coming correct we respect T-H-U-G's 
And these are the warriors and poets with a prophecy 
And I love that Bizzy Bone when he says 
That nobody can stop me who shot me 
Am I bleedin' my heart goes out to Cleveland 
10,000 Cadillacs don't know the meanin' of retreatin' 
While you're scared and all alone 
Cadillac crown is on the throne 
Ask somebody if you don't know you betta phone home get gone. 
You know it's hittin' on the one so son put down that gun 
Doesn't look like you're prepared to battle 
And this Cadillac will not run 
I see you lookin' at me stunned my skin has got me shunned 
Not takin' no shorts or leavin' the court 'till my report is done 
So dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum 
Your girl is lookin' at me like she's gonna give me some 
All stereotypes aside one nation as we ride 9,999 got my back 
And take my side what's your sign 
Feel the vibe join my tribe expand your mind 
Underlined pimp defined down for mine 
As diamonds shine and I'm 24 karat 
Through skills I will inherit Cadillacs are claimin' Cleveland 
And we ain't prepared to share it 
Get gone.
