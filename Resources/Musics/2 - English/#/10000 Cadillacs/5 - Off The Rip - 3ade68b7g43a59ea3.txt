OFF THE RIP

The area code for Cleveland's (216) 
Where Caddy clicks are pimpin' tricks 
So raise your Bics and blaze some shit 
We drop this mix straight off the rip 
We're breaking it down takin' 'em down 
Pound for pound straight from the underground 
I once was lost and now I'm found 
Pop pop and they drop chop chop 
Let it rock and you gotta be down 
To know what's up doc knock knock 
At your door get your guns on the floor 
And I'll tell you once more 
Don't fuck with the funkcore 
We are playa hater slayers 
And we're always playin' fair 
We got this city by the balls 
And we ain't prepared to share 
So get off my jock don't block this cock 
Or ya gonna get pac'ed when the hammer drops 
Cops on the payroll that'll say y'all got popped over rocks 
Recognize this is my scene 
A forty ounce is my cantine 
10,000 on my team and we're all about that green. 
10,000 off the rip motherfucker 
Fuck around straight from the underground 
Shut 'em down 
Shut 'em down 
10,000 Cadillacs 
(216) Cleveland's my crew 
Cadillacs my click
