WE GOT GAME

We've got the game that they want to claim 
Such a shame to see the jealousy and envy they display. 
Panic's automatic and strategy is tragic 
Got game like a no look pass from Magic 
Now we're poundin' down the parkay 
Cadillacs parlay and angels surround me as if my name were Charlie 
10K action opponents in traction 
I march to Armageddon with my Cadillac faction 
My team's a regime and I'm all about that C.R.E.A.M. 
Got money in the backcourt centered like Hakeem crossover 
Motherfucker like you never even seen 
The answers runnin' point Skinny's Runnin' triple beams 
We got ups and we'll be rockin' the mic till the eruption stops 
Each tick of the clock the sweat starts to bead 
We'll give you the freethrow then we'll steal the lead 
White wait stampede behind the back 
Feed got funk in the trunk 'bout to dunk on the team 
Got game motherfucker mad game mad game 
Insane motherfucker insane insane 
Rollin' first class in my Coupe de Ville 
Gonna quench my thirst fast then I'll flex my skills 
Gonna turn this bitch out like I'm runnin' a train 
Even without a limp this pimp still carries a cane 
I got game motherfucker mad game mad game 
Insane motherfucker insane insane 
The name is Saltine AKA Dimebag 
Hittin' like a ballpen rollin' with a zigzag big bag of endo 
Known as the chronic Skinny's got some shit to make you bitches jump 
On it so we flaunt a little heaven cause we're rollin' with Devon 
Let her blow on the dice you know they're comin' up sevens 
We've got the game that they want to claim 
Such a shame to see the jealousy and envy they display.
Bring the boom boom boom and a thump thump thump 
When I jump to the forefront you're gonna get stomped 
And I peep and I creep and I get with takin' no shorts 
Not going out in a shit fit so I step from the waste of time 
I'm on to your game yeah you won't waste mine 
I got it to go so I'm rollin' wit the 40 malt 
Jumpin' the ride lay some rubber on the asphalt 
Skinny says to me I think you're movin' too fast Jay 
Hunt for the blunt so we could front on the ashtray 
Bring that 2 4 6 8 we will annihilate 
You're trippin' on my game 
I could see your eyes dilate 
We've got the game they want to claim 
Such a shame to see the jealously and envy they display. 
I call this microphone the throne I own 
I been callin' it home since the rock was a stone 
So what ya gonna do to me rhyme is nothing new to me 
Been rockin' this motherfucker way before puberty 
Quite a long time by now you know my rhyme is like a guillotine 
Decapitating those who take what's rightfully mine 
I'm insane the name of the game 
Factual thoughts obtain that outta slaughter 
Your brain now I'm gonna attack in fact I'm on a jack 
Tip grip the mic in the ring and let the rhyme rip 
And tear beware no bandwagons in the dragon's lair 
I came here seeking new frontier 
Got game motherfucker mad game mad game 
Insane motherfucker insane insane
