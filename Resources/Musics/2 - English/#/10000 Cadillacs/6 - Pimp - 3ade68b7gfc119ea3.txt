PIMP

We got static in the front and there's panic in the back 
If you challenge me again then my pen will attack 
Cadillacs multiply 10,000 when we ride correct 
You when you're wrong get gone mow say goodbye 
You see I'm still on top this is my spot to rock 
And this shit won't stop 
Don't bother checking the clock 
Give me a few ticks and I'll drop the tock 
While Skinny's got my back like Capt. Kirk got Mr. Spock's 
Block to block rockin' shame shame if you're jockin' 
And I'll drop a playa hater if I catch him cockblockin' 
This game can't be contained I'll maintain my reign 
While you strain to hang still my style remains 
I got leather interior white wall exterior 
A Cadillac as big as an aircraft carrier breaking down barriers 
Shaking your dariers Cadillac killers tell me what could be
Scarier Skinny's on the mix and these Trix aren't for kids 
So phatten up the kicks and pull back the mids 
Lets wax attack trax I'm back to mack 
That I got game and about fame yeah I've been known to attract 
That Cadillacs pimp a playa tha mack the mayor 
Funky rhyme sayer make you want to say yeah 
So dis this or dismiss this have a very merry Christmas 
Nigga I don't give a shit you see that's never been my business 
I'm a pimp a playa the mack the mayor funky rhyme sayer
Make you want to say yeah he's a pimp a player 
Don't give a shit see he don't care he's a pimp a player 
So all you tricks should beware he's a pimp rollin' with my road dogs 
We broke and rewrote laws once 
You hear my flow then you'll know where you stole yours 
Read it in the papers take it to the bank 
I'm a Cadillac so you better be a tank 
I sank your battleship so whatcha gonna do 
You can't hide because you've got no place to run to 
Who knew I knew you're thru 
What's new over the cuckoo's nest once blessed 
One flew back in fact I never left the attack 
Just paused with the cause kicked back and cold macked 
Like a like a true player funky funk rhyme sayer 
Bandwagon is the dragon and I'm the dragon slayer
