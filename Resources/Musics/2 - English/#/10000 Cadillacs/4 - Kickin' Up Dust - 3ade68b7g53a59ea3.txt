KICKIN' UP DUST

Skinny's got the tracks I got the raps my name is wax 
Makin' money by the stacks like 10,000 Cadillacs 
Snappin' necks and cashin' checks 
I wrecks a mic like a Mexican trippin' on tequila 
Better notify your next of kin cold loco like a Cocoa Puff 
Cuckoo for that funky stuff rollin' with some 
Roger cause you know that shit 
So ruff so tuff I'll huff and puff a blunt 
And sink a drink right out that bottle 
10,000 Cadillacs on the motherfuckin' throttle not a goddamn roll model 
You best recognize I'll take a Billy D. any day over St. Ides 
In my pocket there's a Trojan throw on a slow jam 
Some Earth, Wind, and Fire and I'll hit and run 
Until you find the one that makes you realize that your player days are done 
You put the Cadillac in park and let the motherfucker idle 
It's like Skinny said wax is unbridled 
I'm a horse without a saddle like a snake 
I'll shake and rattle always prepared for battle 
I'm a motherfuckin' Cadillac 
Cops are corrupt and kids are kickin' up dust 
And it's about to erupt the world is ready to bust
