TELEKINESIS - FALLING (IN DREAMS)

If you were to tell me
If I'd have had to guess
I never would have told you
If it is not a gift

I will not forget it
As long as Ii live
I will not forget something
That I cannot forgive, no no

Seems to be the wisdom
Conventional regret
Solitary protest
There's nothing to ingest

I will not forget it
As long as I live
I will not forget something
That I cannot forgive

'Cause I've gone far enough
It's your time
'Cause I've gone far enough
It's your time
'Cause I've gone far enough
It's your time
'Cause I've gone far enough
It's your time
