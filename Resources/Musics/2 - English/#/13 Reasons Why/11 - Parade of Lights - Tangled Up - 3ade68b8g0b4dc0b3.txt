PARADE OF LIGHTS - TANGLED UP

I just think about you
Got me wondering why we never tried to give in
I can't live without you
I'm starting to find
This is a fight I can never win

I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing wall and wasting time

So go on without me
Into your life, right out of mine and give in
It feels like a bad dream
I'm starting to find
This is a fight I can never win

I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Staring wall and wasting time
Away
I need love
I get myself I tangled up
Away
I need us
I get myself I tangled up

On and on it goes
On my own alone
Let me run
On and on it goes
On my own alone
Let me run

I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Staring wall and wasting time
Away
I need love
I get myself I tangled up
Away
I need us
I get myself I tangled up
Away
I need love
I get myself I tangled up
Away
I need us
I get myself I tangled up
