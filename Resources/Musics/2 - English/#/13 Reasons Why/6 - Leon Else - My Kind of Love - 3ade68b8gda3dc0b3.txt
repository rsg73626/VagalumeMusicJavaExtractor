LEON ELSE - MY KIND OF LOVE

She thinks I've got a heart of stone
Because I left her all alone, lonely tonight
She thinks I'm gonna break her heart
I tell that I'm not, but maybe she's right

And I know I can't hold you like he does
I don't have those emotions in me
And it's true I can't love you like he does

But it's my kind of love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
My kind of love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
My kind of love

She thinks I'm just an animal
She thinks I've told these thing we had thing to define
She tells me that I will lie alone
I tell her I won't but maybe she's right

And I know I can't hold you like he does
I don't have those emotions in me
And it's true I can't love you like he does

But it's my kind of love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
My kind of love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love

My kind of love, my kind of love, my kind of love
It's taken over as the darker lows
My kind of love, my kind of love, my kind of love
It's taken over as the darker lows

And I know I can't hold you like he does
I don't have those emotions in me
And it's true I can't love you like he does

But it's my kind of love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
My kind of love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love
I'll show you love, show you love, show you love

My kind of love, my kind of love, my kind of love
It's taken over as the darker lows
My kind of love, my kind of love, my kind of love
It's taken over as the darker lows
My kind of love
It's taken over as the darker lows
My kind of love, my kind of love, my kind of love
It's taken over as the darker lows
My kind of love, my kind of love, my kind of love
Love
