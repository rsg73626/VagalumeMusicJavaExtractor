COLOURING - TIME

Time it takes to break my heart
If only I could figure out
Time it takes to make your mark
On the man that's running out
I wish I could've turn the clocks around
But the weight of the world is pulling me down
And everything was easy, only didn't know how
You don't know what you got
Until you fall into the ground

Time, time, time
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Every second counts
Holding the wheel so tight
Are we breaking down?
I never thought
I would want us to turn back around
Are we out of time, time?
Just give me more time
Just give me more time

Time it takes to break my heart
Just tell me how we could make it out
And look this way we've come so far
But then your eyes come with the doubt
And I wish I could've seen the stars align
Oh it was never gonna happen any other time
And everything was easy
Oh when I didn't know you
You don't know what you got
Until it's gone into the blue

Time, time, time
(just give me more time
Just give me more time)
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Every second counts
Holding the wheel so tight
Are we breaking down?
I never thought
I would want us to turn back around
Are we out of time, time?
Just give me more time, just give me more time
Just give me more time, just give me more time

I wish I could've turn the clocks around
I wish I could've turn the clocks around
I wish I could've turn the clocks around
But all the weight of the world
Was pulling me down

Oh, I can't sleep at night
Every second counts
Holding the wheel so tight
Are we breaking down?
I never thought
I would want us to turn back round
Are we out of time, time?
Just give me more time
Just give me time, just give me time
Just give me more time
Just give me more time
