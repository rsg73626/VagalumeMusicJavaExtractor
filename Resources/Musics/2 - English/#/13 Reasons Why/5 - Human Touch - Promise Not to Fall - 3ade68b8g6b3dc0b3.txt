HUMAN TOUCH - PROMISE NOT TO FALL

You've got your back against the wall
I can see by the way that you hold your head
And everything is your fault
When everything starts to heat, heat's on you

'cause you promise not to fall
Before it grew you said you were
Promise me to call it off
Now I'm feeling things so be sure
Promise me it all be good
But it is being good to you
Cause you promise not to fall
Didn't you, didn't you
Promise not to fall

So we finally struck the line
I can see in the darkness there in your eyes
Pretending that it's all fine
But there's another heart eating me
And it's mine

'cause you promise not to fall
Before it grew you said you were
Promise me to call it off
Now I'm feeling things so be sure
Promise me it all be good
But it is being good to you
Cause you promise not to fall
Didn't you, didn't you
You promise not to fall

Didn't you, didn't you
Promise not to fall
Didn't you, didn't you
