YUNGBLUD - FALLING SKIES (FEAT. CHARLOTTE LAWRENCE)

Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

I don't wanna die
But I don't wanna cry lightning
I don't wanna poke a needle in me to feel things
I don't wanna be a [?] liability
But I don't wanna fight
I have never seen the person you are perceiving
But I don't wanna be alone when I start breathing
We are in the middle, an apocalyptic disaster
So, tell me, what does it matter?
Tell me, what does it matter?
You're gonna roll the world up and smoke it all
With you people sitting in a pack of [?]
Yeah, no-one knows we're comatose
right now you are my only hope
Fuck the hype, the life, the world we know
It's only you and me, all the doors are closed
So, hold me close, don't let me go
Let's smoke a cigarette before the world explodes

Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Dying by your side, what heavenly way to die
Guess that guy's line was right
that he never thought he'd see real life
We are in the middle of a fucked up, crazy design
So stand by my side
Yeah, stand by my side
You're gonna roll the world up and smoke till late
Like the planet is a gram and a Mary Jane
To commemorate, just space you wait
while they're hitting the red button like a video game
[?] never true, but we know it
That they're about to go blow it
Yeah, there's no way to control it
So, we might as well be holding each other

Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go (Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go (Don't let me go)
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go (Don't let me go)

Don't let me go-go-go-go-go-go
Don't let me go-go-go-go (go-go-go-go-go)
Don't let me go-go-go-go-go-go (go-go-go-go-go)
Don't let me go-go-go-go (go-go-go-go-go)

Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go
Don't let me go (Don't let me go)
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go-go-go-go-go-go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go-go-go-go-go-go
Even though the sky is falling down
Don't let me go-go-go-go-go-go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go-go-go-go-go-go
Don't let me go
