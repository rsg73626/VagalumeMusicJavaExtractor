ORCHESTRAL MANOEUVRES IN THE DARK - SOUVENIR

Souvenir

It's my direction
It's my proposal
It's so hard
It's leading me astray

My obsession
It's my creation
You'll understand
It's not important now

In conversation
In combination
I tell the truth
My feelings still remain

All I need is
Co-ordination
I can't imagine
My destination
My intention
Ask my opinion
But no excuse
My feelings still remain
