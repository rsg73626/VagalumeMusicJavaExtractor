THE TRAIN

Burry your fears, nothing is real
Listen to the voice, comes from beyond
Fear is the enemy, remember you are
Nothing to learn, there is nothing to learn

Don't want to live, but don't want to die
Don't think but know, no punish from God
No more religions, we are the one
Here is no hell, there is no God
