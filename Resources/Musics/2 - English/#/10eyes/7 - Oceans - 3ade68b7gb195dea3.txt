OCEANS

We are suns nation
And we do creation
Of perfect temptation
By sound is the mission

Thrugh the darkness of future past
A chant between two worlds

We are suns nation
And we do creation
Open dimensions
Releasing damnation

The touch of the infernal creatures never heals

We are suns nation
And we do creation
Of perfect temptation
By sound is the mission

Thousands of lifeless sounds
Create trance chant of evil

Fire walk with us!! Fire walk with us!!

Through the darkness of future past
The touch of the infernal creatures
Through the darkness of future past
The touch of the infernal creatures...

Where you came from
I came from where you see the dark...
Valley of the dawn
