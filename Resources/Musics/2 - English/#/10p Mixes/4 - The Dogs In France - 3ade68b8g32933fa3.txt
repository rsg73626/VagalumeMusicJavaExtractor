THE DOGS IN FRANCE

The dogs in France say "waf waf!"
They ask me for my autograph
They took me for a little stroll-
We talked about love and rock 'n' roll

And when these dogs are good, these dogs are very very good.
And when these dogs are bad, these dogs are awful.
And though they may be small, they're still handy in a fight
But even so, their bark's worse than their bite.

I met a boy called Jean-Pierre
He put some flowers in my hair
He asked if he could hold my hand
I said "I'm not that kind of girl", but he didn't seem to understand

And when these dogs are good, these dogs are very very good
And when these dogs are bad, these dogs are awful.
And though they may be small, they're still handy in a fight
But even so, their bark's worse than their bite.

The dogs in France say "waf waf!"
They ask me for my autograph
They took me for a little stroll-
We talked about love and rock 'n' roll

We went on down to Marseilles
At every disco on the way
I told them they should take their time,
But they didn't heed my warning, just ordered another double vodka, soda and lime.
