NICE DAY FOR A COAT

It's an awfully windy day,
And it looks like it might rain.
Got to go and catch a train.
Nice day for a coat.

The sky's so overcast,
Feels like October at last
Mum's put the heating on
Nice day for a coat

We could be walking in the snow
When winter comes (if it does snow)
But now the leaves are turning brown-
They're about to fall off their trees.

It's an awfully windy day,
And it looks like it might rain.
Got to go and catch a train.
Nice day for a coat.
