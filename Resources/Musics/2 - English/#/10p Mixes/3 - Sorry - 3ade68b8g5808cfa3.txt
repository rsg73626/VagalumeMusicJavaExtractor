SORRY

I ask you if i'm pretty twenty times a day
I pout and scream and cry until i get my way
I've always been a spoilt little girl at heart
But one of these days i'm going to push you too far

If you left me, what would i do?
I can't be happy unless i'm hurting you

And i'm sorry for being unkind
Please forgive me for the hundredth time
And you know the only reason i'm moany
And crave attention just like a pony
And give you grief and make you feel lonely
Is i love you

I like to talk things over until i talk them to death
And when you're nice i accuse you and give you hell
I like to push your buttons to see how you react
And treat all situations with the minimum of tact

If you left me, what would i do?
I can't be happy unless i'm hurting you

And i'm sorry for being unkind
Please forgive me for the hundredth time
And you know the only reason i'm moany
And crave attention just like a pony
And give you grief and make you feel lonely
Is i love you

I'm sorry for being unkind
Please forgive me for the hundredth time
And you know i never mean to annoy you
You stupid lovely gorgeous boy-you
But god sometimes it's fun to annoy you
Cos i love you
