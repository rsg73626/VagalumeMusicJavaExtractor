(BABY) I STOPPED LOVING YOU (LONG AGO)

You were never that kind to me, I realise now
We stayed together far too long (I don't know how)
Oh well, it's over now
You didn't break my heart
My favourite thing about you was our time apart

All those nights you spent away, leaving me on my own
Yeah, I got pretty lonely, but I wasn't alone
I found ways to cope when I felt down
I had so much fun without you around

You say that it's not fair
But I don't care
Baby I stopped loving you long ago

There's no point saying sorry, I don't want to know
And don't you try to call me, cos I won't be home
Darling give it up, please just move on
I feel so much better now you've gone

You say that it's not fair
But I don't care
Baby I stopped loving you long ago

I don't know why it came as a surprise
I don't know why you didn't see it
It was in front of your eyes
