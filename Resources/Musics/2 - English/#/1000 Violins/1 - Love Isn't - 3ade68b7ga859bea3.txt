LOVE ISN'T

Please don't tell me that i'm wrong
After everybody hears this song
I've seen the error of my ways
So lets change them for the rest of these days

Love isn't what you've done right
This isn't what love should be
Love isn't staying together all night
The love of the world can't set you free

(bidge)when did love become a kissing show?
Love is harder then we make it
As we replace love with the mistletoe
Everybody's tryin' 2 fake it

(chorus) love isn't a game wrapped in kisses
Love isn't always hits and misses
What have we done?
What's this creature love's become?
And why can't we stop?!

So let me tell you what true love is
Cuz it sure ain't all this kissing biz
True love is set upon faith, hope, and trust
All for one or all to bust

(bridge) when did love become a kissing show?
Love is harder then we make it
As we replace love with the mistletoe,
Everybody's tryin' to fake it

Love isn't a game wrapped in kisses,
Love isn't always hits and misses
What have we done?
What is this creature love's become?
Why can't we stop?!
Why can't we stop?!
