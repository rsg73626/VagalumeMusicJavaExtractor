LEFT BOY

I've been gone too long
Working on these songs, yeah
Work is a bitch and me and her don't get along, cause
I'm stuck, I try to keep my head up
Cause I know if I don't get up
Nothing around here is going to be better
Well I guess that's life
Sometimes it feels like shitting, right
I'm at home up all night
All alone most of the time

[Chorus]
Why do I do this shit 10 Am in the morning
I ain't seen no one in a month
and I got deadlines on deadlines
Back and forth through the room
I thought again, this tune ''I miss you
Why didn't you come back''

Cause I need to get things done
I wanna be that kid that they put on
Yea, they be like: What's that song?
Yeah that's my favorite one

Who's that kid, looks like shit
Like he got no sleep in a month and a little bit
Alright, let the KK out, listen, what you're trying to say
This ain't a good look right outta a book
But when I get a beat then I come up with a right hook
Needa get a tight hook that works all night long
And some nights that give me that summertime bronze

Next in line, I'm far from the exit sign
And I know that it's going (to) be great
If I pull my way, I can't wait
It's like the sun is coming back up
How about today
Gimme some good weed in the motherfucking hot tub
I'm way and I don't know when I'll come back
Because I just put it down real real nice for y'all
So I'ma let you think about that
