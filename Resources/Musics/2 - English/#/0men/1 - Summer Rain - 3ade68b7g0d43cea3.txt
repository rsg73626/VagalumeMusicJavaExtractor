SUMMER RAIN

World Without a Breeze
Heartbeat of the Heat Above the Harbour
Lazy Day Lies Dazed Upon the Shelf
Atomic Lizards Lick At the Blaze of a Light That Is Forever
No Move in the Solid Skies
No Gleaming Metal Out of the Breathtaking Blue


My Golden Circus Girls All Sailed Away
The Lion Tamers Are no Longer Due to Play
Whoever Breaks the Seven Seals
And Lets the Angry Angels Free
I Do Not Know
Just Waiting Here
For Summer Rain
For Summer Rain
Or Anything Else


Prophet Hold Your Head Up
Into a Cluster of Bees and Listen
"love of My Life
Here Is All Our Honey
Yes, We Can Change the World, Together"
And If We're Still Invited to Walk in This Party
I'd Go For a Saucerful of Secrets Or More
But the Last Thing I Heard of Was That God Had Left the Lines
For a Brand New Universe
He Was Supposed to Say


My Golden Circus Girls All Sailed Away
The Lion Tamers Are no Longer Due to Play
Whoever Breaks the Seven Seals and Lets the Angry Angels Free
I Do Not Know
Just Waiting Over There
For Summer Rain
For Summer Rain


What a Glorious Feeling
I am Happy Again
Just Cool Rain
