THE BEAUTY OF BLOOD

Tears shatter as they fall
1000 crystals to split the light
The beauty of the rainbow
To mask the blood that stains the ground

Vision blurs and the ground shakes
Children cry in their mother's arms
A flower can't drink from parched land
They ddrink the blood that stains the ground

The beauty of blood is in us all
The beauty of blood eats away at my soul
I've watched you die a thousand times
A thousand more and it still would be beautiful

You're beautiful to me
