AT THE END

Emember back in 93'
It was him and him and you and me
We all hung out in the hallway
Remember our good old school yard days
We didnt care about time or money
We just had fun and played hookey
We all got closer together
We treated eachother like brothers

But as the time went by, ive come to realise
Our friendships not the same
Theres really no one to blame

Here we are, staring at
At the end of something good
Here we are, staring at
At the end of brother hood
Here we are, staring at
The end of something good
Here we are, staring at
The end of brother hood

We always had eachothers back
No matter what differences we may of had
We all went out separate pathes
Just thinking about it makes me sad
Why dont we go on our friends
It isnt that bad, its at the end
What about all those times
Brother hood is a crime.

But as the time went by, ive come to realise
Our friendships not the same
Theres really no one to blame

Here we are, staring at
At the end of something good
Here we are, staring at
At the end of brother hood
Here we are, staring at
The end of something good
Here we are, staring at
The end of brother hood

And all this time,
Ive been thankful for having friends like you
It will never get to my mind,
As you, this is what it comes to
But i just have to face the facts
That nothing in this world is really meant to last
Here we are, its where were at.
Here we are again.

Here we are, staring at
At the end of something good
Here we are, staring at
At the end of brother hood
Here we are, staring at
The end of something good
Here we are, staring at
The end of brother hood
