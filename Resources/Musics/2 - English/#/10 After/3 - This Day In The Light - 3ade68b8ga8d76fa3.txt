THIS DAY IN THE LIGHT

words cannot express
the moments spent with you
deep within my heart i'll cherish this day
walking hand in hand with you
i feel like im floating away

and as the days go by
my feeling progress and
i can't help myself 'cause
i just can't stop thinking about you

remember this day in the light
of you and i she said
i'll always have my door open for you

remember this day in the light
of you and i she said
i'll always have a
place in my heart for you

if things don't go our way
will we still be friends?
im hoping and praying
this wont be the end

and as the days go by
my feeling progress and
i can't help myself 'cause
i just can't stop thinking about you

remember this day in the light
of you and i she said
i'll always have my door open for you

remember this day in the light
of you and i she said
i'll always have a
place in my heart for you

for you, just for you.
