BATHING IN HATE

I used to care until you showed me how weak I was
I used to care until my eyes filled with hate
I used to think I had the one thing that never died
I found the truth to late

Bathing in hate
Til it wash over me
Bathing in hate
Til it covers me

I used to be so much more than this
I used to be the one with open arms
I used to know who I could trust
Dreams to dust

Bathing in hate
Til it wash over me
Bathing in hate
Til it covers me
