STATE OF MIND

Look into my eyes and you will see
The way your thoughts should be
Listen to the tone of my voice
And understand you have no choice
This is the way it will be
All your days with me
I don't understand what you hope to gain
You always know it ends in pain

Your eyes open wide
With your back against the wall
Keep your lips shut tight
Like a good little doll

Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time

I've said the same thing since the very start
That we will never be apart
I've held your hand and I have held it tight
Even when it trembled in fright
No one knows the truth like I do
That everything is caused by you
You bring it on yourself so dry those tears
No one hears

Your eyes open wide
With your back against the wall
Keep your lips shut tight
Like a good little doll

Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time

It's you and me until the end
You and me until the end
You and me until the end
It's you and me until the end

Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time
