THE LESSON

I heard every word you've said
Even if my eyes were closed
I felt every statement you made
Even when you chose not to speak

Look at what I have become
This pathetic shell youâ€™ve constructed
I am your living legacy
Broken, battered, bruised, by your love

I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end

I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end

Why can't you look me in the eyes
Does it frighten you to see yourself
I can see how that would cause you pain
I've felt it everyday myself

All at once it seems so clear
I don't have to be trapped here
I can pick up my pieces and walk away
From this shattered life you've led for me

I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end

I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end

You're nothing without me
I'm nothing with you
I am who you are
I'm better than that
You have no place to go
Anywhere but here
Who else would hold your hand
Then let me go

Take my pride
Take my faith
Take my trust
Take my dignity

I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end

I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end
