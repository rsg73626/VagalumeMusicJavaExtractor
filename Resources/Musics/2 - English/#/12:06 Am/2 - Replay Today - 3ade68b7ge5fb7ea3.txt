REPLAY TODAY

The face I wear today
Will soon fade away
And the dreams I have made
Will die where they lay

Call it cowardice for not seeing it â€˜til the end
Show you these open wounds I've got to start to mend

Trust is not my friend
As faith walks out again
Unwilling to bend
The strength I need ascend

Let my weakness carry me I cannot fight alone
Show me every single fault and turn my heart to stone

Replay today
I never wanted to be blind
Replay today
I didn't want to be this kind
