STRENGTH

Don't see what you do
And I haven't for so long
Where is this wealth of inner resolve
This foundation you think I stand upon

Where is this strength
You say lives inside of me
So I can lift my eyes once more
And be who I should be
Where's my strength

Jackhammer pounds the mind
You're nothing without me
Hearing these words echo through my head
This twisted, distorted image stands instead

Where is this strength
You say lives inside of me
So I can lift my eyes once more
And be who I should be
Where's my strength

I can't see
What you see in me
So how can I believe
That what you see
Is me
