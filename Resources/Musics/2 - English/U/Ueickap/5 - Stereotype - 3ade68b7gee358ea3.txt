STEREOTYPE

This is my ego 
Breaking your boring, fucking convention 
This is my superstar 
Waiting for something, something special 
This is my actress 
Beautiful blonde girl 
Blue eyes and a short life 
This is my window 
Timeless flowers 
And sweet smelling too 

This is my jealousy 
Scratching your skin with uncountable fingers 
This is my innocence 
I have nothing to blame myself for 

This is my life, can?t you see 
Unless those people make you blind 
This is my hate, can?t you feel 
You should stay with your eyes open wide 

This is my great hall 
Full of seats, but no guests 
This is my big big world 
But I?m not a big girl, or something like that 

This is my jealousy 
Scratching your skin with uncountable fingers 
This is my TV show 
Brothers, sisters, parents and tears 
This is my dear best friend 
He calls me he asks me but I don?t need him 
This is my innocence 
I have nothing to blame myself for 

All this time i?ve seen you here 
You dreamed my dreams 
And I dream our life 
And I saw this in you 
My stereotype, my stereotype? 

This is my jealousy 
Scratching your skin with uncountable fingers 
This is my TV show 
Brothers, sisters, parents and tears 
This is my dear best friend 
He calls me he asks me but I don?t need him 
This is my innocence 
I have nothing to blame myself for
