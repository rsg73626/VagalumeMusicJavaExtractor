SOMETIMES

All is cold between my fingers
Just remains of my dead past
I sense memories that linger
But i know they won’t last

I’ve been crushed by my anger
Upside down for a while
Now I’m trying to survive
When everything around dies

I’ve seen you there
Always in mind
I’d like to stay
Always so fine

Sometimes I wish for my world
To fall down shattered from the sky
Sometimes I wait for my soul
To vanish in the night

All my undecided faith
All my delicate balance
Have been troubled by your stupid sentence
Your fucking sentence

I’ve seen you there
Always in mind
I’d like to stay
Always so fine

Sometimes I wish for my world
To fall down shattered from the sky
Sometimes I wait for my soul
To vanish in the night
Sometimes I pray for some God
To come and shine light on my soul
Sometimes I have to stay here
But I just want to go…

Last time I looked into your world
The same time I listened to your words
My mind got lost under the stars
So high…

Sometimes I wish for my world
To fall down shattered from the sky
Sometimes I wait for my soul
To vanish in the night
Sometimes I pray for some God
To come and shine light on my soul
Sometimes I have to stay here
But I just want to go…
