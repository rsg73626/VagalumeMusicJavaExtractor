NOISELESSNESS

Can you hear the different sound of your words
It seems like a preach, they want my respect
Carry your double face out of the room
Your time has just finished, mine’s ready to start

You know I’ve been waiting
You know what’s the truth
It smells like a beautiful thought in my head
You know I’ve been waiting
You know where’s your place
Now keep your position
And just let me live my life

Watching the truth coming mixed with your lies
Remember my honesty will take it out
I see the difference between our skins
‘Cause with your sham glow you have seen the darkness in me

You know I’ve been waiting

You know what’s the truth
It smells like a beautiful thought in my head
You know I’ve been waiting

Take by your noiselessness
Leave me to fill in the blanks
Take me by your noiselessness
Save your breath I’m knowing you

I can’t stop listening to your voice
I feel you crying
I won’t stop looking for your soul

Take by your noiselessness (take my hand now)
Leave me to fill in the blanks
Take me by your noiselessness
Save your breath I’m knowing you

(Know I’ll save you)
Trouble in my heart
I see you, I see the dark
I want to give you your last breath…
