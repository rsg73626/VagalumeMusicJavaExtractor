WHY

Come over, it's all over 
You found the right design 
Conflictually heartbroken 
So sweetly hypocrite 

Days are lost in pain 
And I wonder how to tell you that I'm sorry 
There was a fragile link 
That you wanted to tear apart 
Inside your head? 

You crossed the line into the fire 
You compromised your precious game 
Hear the voices, hear this crying 
They're screaming your name 
With burning tears filling your eyes 
And freezing silence in your mind 
You chose to leave with no goodbyes 
I wasn?t standing on? 

your side?  Come over 
before?  It?s all over 
I'll try?  So sweetly hypocrite 

Days still lost in pain 
And I wonder how could you tell us that you were sorry 
You broke the fragile link 
Now I know you're still outside 
Here in my hands 

You crossed the line into the fire 
You compromised your precious game 
Hear the voices, hear this crying 
They're screaming your name 
With burning tears filling your eyes 
And freezing silence in your mind 
You chose to leave with no goodbyes 
I can?t even ask you? 

Where's your light? 
Where's your home? 

You crossed the line into the fire 
You compromised your precious game 
Hear the voices, hear this crying 
They're screaming your name 
With burning tears filling your eyes 
And freezing silence in your mind 
You chose to leave with no goodbyes 
I can?t even ask you 
Why?
