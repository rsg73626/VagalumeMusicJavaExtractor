TURN IT UP (SLIP AWAY)

You have to face this now 
Will you choose to let it out and show me what you
are

You always turn things down 
And always try to explain your truth with a single
line 

This time I know the things you?re going to miss me
for 
This time I'll leave you there 

You have two faces now 
Will you choose a better one to show me what you are 
I'm always trying so hard 
And as always, i have to find another way to stay
fine


This time I know the things you?re going to miss me
for 
This time I'll leave you there 

Turn it up, and I'll hear your voice 
Turn it up, and I'll be your choice 
Turn it up, and I'll hear your voice 
You?ll say the word and I'll slip away? 

If I can tell (the) truth from (the) lies 
The answer's in your eyes 
I can't wrap myself 
In your nothingness? I'll slip away, slip away, slip 

away? 

I'll slip away!! 

This time I know the things you?re going to miss me
for 
This time I?ll leave you there 

Turn it up, and I'll hear your voice 
Turn it up, and I'll be your choice 
Turn it up, and I'll hear your voice 
You'll say the word and I'll slip away.. 
Turn it up, and I'll hear your voice 
Turn it up, and I'll be your choice 
Turn it up, and I'll hear your voice 
You'll say the word and I'll slip away! 
And I'll slip away!...
