MY CONDITION

My condition

I don’t think you’ll be satisfied
I don’t feel the connection start
And I’m sure my solution’s right
I’ll force you, this is my condition

Think? Well I don’t think anymore
My time has come…

A whole new life is waiting in the world outside
Turned my heart to stone well I’ll force you to return all that you’ve taken.

I won’t need you, your empty smile
I won’t shine for you my naked star
I won’t feed you those delicious lies
And I’m not sorry for this condition

Think? Well I don’t think anymore
My time has come…

A whole new life is waiting in the world outside
Turned my heart to stone, well I’m willing to be sacrificed
Stopping my slow falling down, as I bleed I make no sound
I am here, I stand my ground, while you’re turning inside out

It takes time – to find – our side – so I’ll take time.
It’s my condition!

A whole new life is waiting in the world outside
Looking for my soul, well I’m willing to be sacrificed
Stopping my slow falling down, as I bleed I make no sound
I am here, I stand my ground, while you’re turning inside out

Looking for my soul, well I am willing to be sacrificed
I am here, I stand my ground, while you’re turning inside out


I’ll take time.
