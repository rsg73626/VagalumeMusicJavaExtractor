T.O.Y.

T.O.Y.

Listen to me
Slow down for a moment and set your mind free
It’s time to wake up from the slow sleep you’re in
And open your eyes to the truth deep within
Did you ever realize that
We’re living in a world of lies
Those walls are trapping us inside

False messiahs speak their truth
Selling cheap dreams they tell you what to believe to
With their voices, silky and smooth
Producing hysteria now they own you

Stop praying me
I’m not one of those gods that need your belief
It’s time to give up, it’s the end can’t you see?
They smashed you, they thrashed you
They silenced your screams
Revenge is the answer
You’re looking for to free your mind
No broken promises you’ll find

False messiahs speak their truth
Selling cheap dreams they tell you what to believe to
With their voices, silky and smooth
Producing hysteria now they own you
Always trying to keep you down
Enjoying your pain they gain and you lose
Be yourself before it’s too late
You’ve got to believe only in what you choose

Just a freak show
Running too slow
I’m exhausted
All time wasted…
(wake up!)

Just a freak show
Running too slow
I’m exhausted
It’s time to wake up, to stand up, to blow up ‘cause

I’m tired of this world of lies
My mind’s still trapping me inside

False messiahs speak their truth
Selling cheap dreams they tell you what to believe to
With their voices, silky and smooth
Producing hysteria now they own you
Always trying to keep you down
Enjoying your pain they gain and you lose
Be yourself before it’s too late
You’ve got to believe only in what you choose

False messiahs – they own you
Believe only in what you choose

Just a freak show
Running too slow
I’m exhausted
Nothing’s wasted!
