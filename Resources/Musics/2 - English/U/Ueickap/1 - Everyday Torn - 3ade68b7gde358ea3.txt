EVERYDAY TORN

Kill my pain, choose the way 
Waiting for it, I just feel safe 
Calling you, you call my name 
I understand what you say but I don?t think the same 
I touch your shoulder, I see you pale 
Playing that game you make my plans 
There is goodness in the air 
Take it on, fly 
You will be pure 

Somewhere there were some ugly faces 
I choose to take this one 

Lick your fingers, move your head now 
Like on a stupid dancefloor 
Keep on smiling, I?ll stop crying 
I am everyday torn 

Always you in front of me 
Take my hand and speak about your home 
Days don?t come back in your life 
I?ll try to reap the best things that you?ve left behind 

Somewhere there were some ugly faces 
I choose to take this one 

Lick your fingers, move your head now 
Like on a stupid dancefloor 
Keep on smiling, I?ll stop crying 
I am everyday torn 

Grab it up, see you just, later 
Move it up, keep it up, neighbour 
Grab it up, see you just, later 
Grab it up, see you just, later! 

Lick your fingers, move your head now 
Like on a stupid dancefloor 
Keep on smiling, I?ll stop crying 
I am everyday torn
