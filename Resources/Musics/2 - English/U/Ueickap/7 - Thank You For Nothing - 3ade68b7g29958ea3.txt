THANK YOU FOR NOTHING

It’s too late to say goodbye
To find a face behind
Dressing up my life
I’m in a prison
There’s nothing left to do
Nothing left to tell you about me
And my sad story

All of my life I’ve been waiting for someone to love
All of my lies have been taken as natural

I think when I was a child
My father always told me “Don’t cry”
When I was a little child
Playing with my life
Knowing that my friends where different from me
And my sad truth

All of my life I’ve been waiting for someone to love

All of my lies have been taken as natural
All of my life I’ve been waiting for someone to love
All of my cries have been wasted for something wrong

Watching through my window
I see the life outside
Standing as the wind blows
I think about me

‘Cause all of my life I’ve been waiting for someone to love
All of my lies have been taken as natural
All of my life I’ve been waiting for someone to love
All of my cries have been wasted for something wrong
