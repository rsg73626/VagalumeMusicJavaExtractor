DEBUTANTE

DEBUTANTE
She was a pillar of society, destined to live a life of ignominy
on a plane going nowhere in a soap opera world, what we gonna do with this
girl?


She keeps me waiting, debutante
She keeps me waitng, heart's been bought

Scoring glue on the eastside with her rolex watch, she's got the manners of a
queen the morals of a dog
with a face like that she could stop a clock, she drags me down I just can't
stop

It hurts some times, it hurts sometimes
when you give all you can and it's not enough and you can't get no love cause
her love's been bought
