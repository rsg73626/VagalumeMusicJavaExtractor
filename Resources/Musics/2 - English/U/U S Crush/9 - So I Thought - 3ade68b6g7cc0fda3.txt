SO I THOUGHT

SO I THOUGHT
So I thought we could be lovers and friends and still we'd get along
So I thought that we could find a cloud that we could ride upon
So I thought we could, So I thought we could, so I thought we should
Chances were we would, what went wrong with us, now things aren't so good
Cause I heard girls like you were only found on TV and magazines
Where this leads us now, guess that remains yet to be seen


So I thought we'd end up together our paths forever crossed
A destiny and a tragedy, without you I'll be lost
How'd it come to this, the shadow has been cast, thought it'd always last
So I thought we could, I really felt it should, now things aren't so good
Cause I heard girls like you were only found on TV and magazines
Living without you changes what living means to me

So I thought we could be lovers nd friends and still we'd get along
so I thought that we could make something better I'd tell you in a song

Remember how it was, remember what it meant, thought it'd always last
So I thought we could, so I thought we could, so I thought we should
