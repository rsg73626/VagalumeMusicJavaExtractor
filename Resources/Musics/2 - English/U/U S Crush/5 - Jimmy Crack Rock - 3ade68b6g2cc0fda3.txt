JIMMY CRACK ROCK

JIMMIE CRACK ROCK
Jimmie Crack Rock, baby I don't care
Jimmie Crack Rock, baby I don't care
Jimmie Crack Rock, baby I don't care
Jimmie Crack Rock, baby I don't care

Hey man, are you looking for redemption
Hey man, I've got it right here
Hey man, do you need some salvation
Come on over here

They said to escape there's nothing easier
unless you find the truth
We can't take care of the ones already here
What's a little boy supposed to do

I don't care

Hey man, do you bow down to the dollar
The guy with the most toys win
Hey man, think your kids a bit neglected
Come on over here
