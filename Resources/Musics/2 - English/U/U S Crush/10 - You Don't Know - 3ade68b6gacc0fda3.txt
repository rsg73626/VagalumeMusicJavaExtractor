YOU DON'T KNOW

YOU DON'T KNOW
So many questions, we need some answers
restless and aimless on our way
Where are we going, what are we knowing
It holds us together separately
You don't know what you're looking for
coming right now knocking at your door

Proudly unstable, willing and able
A narrow gate you offer me
Thoughtless incision, selfish precision
It tears us apart now can''t you see

You don't know what you're looking for
coming right now knocking at your door
Temptation, salvation, stand up and show your colors now
You don't know what you're looking for

There is a secret place, that time can not erase
where everyone's accountable for their mistakes
there is no shame in grace, maybe more give less take
this isn't over yet, time to go face to face
I want to find the truth, I need to know the way
I gotta listen hard to all the things you say
The light is shining through, now I know what to do
separate but still together we can make it new

You don't know what you're looking for
Coming right now knocking at your door
Surrender, pretender, bow down now on your knees and pray
You don't know what you're looking for
