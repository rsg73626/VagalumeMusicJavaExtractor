PROBLEM

PROBLEM
I don't wanna talk about it, if I talk then I'll get mad you don't want to
see that
I don't wanna think about it, cause that makes me want to drink, that's what
got me here I think
Come on, come on, when you feel like nothing nothing that you feel feels good
Come on, come on, just another day in Mister Rogers neighborhood
Pass the Prozac please, I'm so bummed that I can't see
so I called up Dr. Drew and I asked him what to do
he said I needed help oh my God
I think I got a problem, I don't wanna get out of bed
I think I got a problem problem problem
Yaa I'm messed up in the head but I should be cool tomorrow

I think I got a problem, yaa I need a little help
I think I got a problem problem problem
I can't fix this by myself
But I should be cool tomorrow, I should be cool tomorrow
It can't get any worse today
