LOSER

LOSER
I can't deal with your reality
You can't deal with what's become of me
We don't get along I wonder why

I didn't fit your mold I didn't make the grade
Just couldn't cut it
Some days it seemed like I should just give up
You kill me softly
Cause, they don't get it, they don't get it
They're so preoccupied they don't know who I am
Can't they see it, can't they see it, they're just so ignorant they can't pretend

I can't deal with your reality
You can't deal with what's become of me
We don't get along I wonder why
So long, so long

Who's the loser now
I'm still kicking
Tried to drag me down
Now who's winning?

Take the time to spread the blame
The mirror should be the place you aim
Take the truth responsibly
That you and me we don't agree
