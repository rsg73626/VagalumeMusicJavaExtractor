BLEED

BLEED
I'm just a sidebar
I'm just an after thought
They all just wrote me off

So you and me we gotta live in a world of make believe
It's hard to hold on to nothing but we can't give in
Cause everything that is real and that matters ain't for free

So we scrape and bleed, we break
We stand together yeah we gotta do it
We bleed, we break, they said we wouldn't make it, all the others for sake

Look down upon me
On what it could've been
They think we'll never win

Wasted time, some say wasted life, part of sacrifice

Yeah we bleed, we break, we stand together yea we gotta do it
We bleed, we break, they said we wouldn't make it all the others forsake
We break, against all odds we lay it on the line
Yea we bleed, we break, we stand together yea we gotta do it now
