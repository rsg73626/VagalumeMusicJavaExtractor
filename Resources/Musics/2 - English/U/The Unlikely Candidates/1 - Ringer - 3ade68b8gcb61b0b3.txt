RINGER

She's a ringer
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring around her finger
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring

There's a lady
Got a lot of ambition
Shady's
My intuition
Says she's a doctor 'cause she's got the pills
She's just a ringer who lives in the hills
So crazy
Don't know if I can trust her
Lately
She'stalking like a hustler
She could be the american dream
I'd do anything for her to marry me

She's worth her weight in gold
But one thing I know

She's a ringer
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring around her finger
Gotta know
Gotta know
Gotta know

She's a lady
Gonna be richer than her daddy
Thirsty
She's sipping on a forty
Her love is free but it won't come cheap
She'll rob all the boys
If their shits too weak
She told me
Her love is like the dollar
Greedy
But I'll never really have her
She won't be my american dream
Won't wear my ring
She said it won't fit me

She's worth her weight in gold
But one thing I know

She's a ringer
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring around her finger
Gotta know
Gotta know
Gotta know

She looks so hungry to me
With her golden teeth
Will I ever be enough
Move or she might knock you out
Only 5 foot 3
The world won't be enough

She's a ringer
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring around her finger
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring

She's a ringer
Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring around her finger
Gotta know
Gotta know
Gotta know

Put a ring
Put a ring
Put a ring around her finger
