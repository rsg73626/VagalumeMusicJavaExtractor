VIOLENCE

Maybe I should leave her
Maybe I don't need her
Maybe I was wrong

Maybe she was right
Maybe I believe her

What do I have to say? (To find a mistake)
What do I have to do?
She don't know either
She says I'm gonna show you how to act
Momma don't talk like that
she gonna hit me with a baseball bat, yeah
And all her lovers say

She breaks the silence
Here comes the sirens
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence
Echoes divide and she shows no kindness
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence
Running from the violence

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Running from the violence
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Running from the violence

Says I'm show you how to act
Momma don't talk like that
She gonna hit me with a baseball bat
And all her lovers say

What do I have to do?
What do I have to say?

She breaks the silence
Here comes the sirens
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence
Echoes divide and she shows no kindness
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence

(Oh, oh, oh)
Running from the violence
(Oh, oh, oh)
Running from the violence

She says that I'm the one
(one to find something)
She's pulling out a gun
Says now we're having fun
Give me all your love, I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough

Says I'm gonna show you how to act
Momma don't talk like that
She gonna hit me with a baseball bat
And all her lovers say

She breaks the silence
Here comes the sirens
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence
Echoes divide and she shows no kindness
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence

She breaks the silence
Here comes the sirens
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence
(I'm show you how to act)
Echoes divide and she shows no kindness
Bang, bang, bang
I'm just running from the violence
