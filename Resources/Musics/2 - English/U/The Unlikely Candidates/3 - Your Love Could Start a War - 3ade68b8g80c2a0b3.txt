YOUR LOVE COULD START A WAR

You know I gotta love you
Our name is written in the streets
You are a force of nature
The fires running through your feet

Ohh your love, your love could start a war
Your love, is what I am fighting for
I would would die for this revelation
Ohh your love, your love could start a
Your love could start a war

The dawn will break before you
Under your thumb I'm on my knees
You play a game of pressure
You're getting stronger while I sleep

You'll burn up the sky you're a constellation
Swear I could die in this revelation
Ohh your love, your love could start a war
Your love, is what I am fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Ohh your love, your love could start a
Your love could start a war

You'll burn or cry standing out to fear
Just take my life, I know the end is here
You'll run and dancin, but I just want to fly
I hear you singing, tomorrow never dies

I would die for this revelation
Ohh your love, your love could start a war
Your love could start a war
It's what I am fighting for
