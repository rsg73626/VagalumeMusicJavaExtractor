STAGESTRUCK

The curtain calls
As I fall
(Glazed your eyes)
Subject change in the box
It hides the grief as the knife drops
As the knife drops

From your heaven - the worlds our stage
Romance lived by repetition
Freedom - in our prison of passion

Stage-struck-struck-stage

Character/actor/character
Confuse the real me
(Two souls rest within this breast)
The swords of passion - the words pierce your heart
As the victim of fashion - the reputation's to live my part
Unleash the character

From your heaven - the worlds our stage
Romance lived by repetition
Freedom - in our prison of passion
Stage-struck-struck-stage

Stage born stage bred
Soul torn stage dead
