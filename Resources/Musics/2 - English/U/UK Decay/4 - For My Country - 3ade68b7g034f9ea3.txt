FOR MY COUNTRY

A night for celebration
A night to unwind 
A night when Dr Jekyll 
Pushes Mr Hyde from behind 

Release me, I will unwind tonightÉ 

The hopes delay the message 
Distorted in my mind 
Emotions begin to rise 
This system starts to unwind 

Release me, I will unwind tonightÉ 

WeÕre burning through the dark
The facts donÕt seem the same 
A game for the insane 
The cat begins to bark 

Release me, I will unwind tonightÉ

Falling into the night 
A twisted vision stands clear 
Clear in my sight 
WeÕre revelling in this devilÕs delight 
It seems so right 
As the AdamÕs bite 
TonightÉ

I will unwind
