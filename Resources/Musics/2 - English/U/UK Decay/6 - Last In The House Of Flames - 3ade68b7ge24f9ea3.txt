LAST IN THE HOUSE OF FLAMES

Hubble-bubble
Toil and troubled
House burns
Bodies Bubble

Will you run? Do you hide?
Or burn inside
When your last in the house of flames

Inferno hell .............. Out of luck
Lesson learnt ...........Self destruct
Unpleasant smell...... Spare no grief
Flesh burns ............. .To catch a thief

Will you run? Do you hide?
Or burn inside
When your last in the house of flames
Burnnnnn

Can you run?........Homeward
Can you hide?......Heavenbound
Climb.....................When your house
Outside................ Burns down

So smart to act the clown
When your house burns down
Last in the house of flames
Lost in the house of flames
Well you can laugh - but you won't
When you're last!
