BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS

Seeing through the light
Elixir of life
Lay down your heart
To be found to believe - conceiving
A belief in heaven
And as your god begins to rise

Chased the illusion
Profusing the elusive (god)
A pagan love
Lost in a circle
Chased the illusion
In an effort to relieve
The need to believe
(God) In your eyes
And as your god begins to rise

The idea
So burn in your fire
Your sacrifice
In a god feared pyre
And as your god begins to rise

Flattery with sticks and stones
Never alone with god in your home
God of stone
And as your god begins to rise

The dark years you believed - your earthly gods
Before your eyes
Their existence cannot deceive
And as your god begins to rise

And the battle begins...
The crack in the sky - another god cries
Beating upon his scorched earth

Around the circle
Dancing in the circle of fire

Sacrifice to fire (god)
Fed by the howling (god)
Incinerated ashes to earth (god)

To ashes - to dust
Lost in the anger

...Stands a man - a book in his hand
Sacrilegious seeking sanctity (and as your gods begin to rise)
Sacrilegious seeking sanctity (the christian disguise)
Sacrilegious seeking sanctity (the christian disguise)
Sacrilegious seeking (the christian disguise)
Money
