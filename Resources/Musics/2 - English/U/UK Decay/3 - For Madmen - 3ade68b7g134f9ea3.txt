FOR MADMEN

Seeing through bitter eyes
Pride is prime of youth 
His blackness - is his vanity
To side - the side of truth
He knows - he'll always lose
He's lost before
A boy with a grievance

A man with a grudge to bear
Society seen to destroy all he's been
Vietnam taught to kill
Dormant behind the will
He still retains the will
And he will

The scarcity of pain
In contentment rich boy realize
No pleasure - is pleasure
Till he's fed by its name
Nothing to lose
Still less to gain

Nameless, Faceless
Walking corpse
I met murder on the way
He wore a mask like today

Around every corner
A conscience cries
Struggling for breath in a vacuum
Faced with the cold gaping wound

For madmen only 
Know where contentment lies
For madmen only

A coolness knows no conscience
Put away with finality
In the high impassioned pit of murder
Conscience free - slit accuracy

For madmen only
Never search for happiness
For madmen only
Only pleasure

Everybody is that crime
Walking the thin straight line
The tightrope of tragedy

For madmen only 
Know where contentment lies
For madmen only

The great american dream
... The decline of civilization
...... Echoed in the victim's scream


......... I met murder on the way
............ He wore a mask like today
