TESTAMENT

Walking through the garden
Through the garden of temptation
Tempestuous in youth 
Seek the testament of truth

An angst that bears no sobs or self-pitied cries
He cherishes his one daily job with pride
The job to stay alive

Quest for reasons in empty hearts
Death the adventure when life's the bore
But in the face of defeat a lion roars

Statutes stand like statues
Laws stagnant in value
For the rulers of the ruled
The fools and the fooled

But should your carcass rot in a gutter
While your ideals go to heaven
When rebellion's the cause
Like a spartacus it's yours today
And tomorrow this testament will fall
Dying to be written
A new testament to be born

The lion roars, the lion roars
The lion roars as never before
in testament
