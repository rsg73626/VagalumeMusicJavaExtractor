UNEXPECTED GUEST

And as the clock strikes three 
But no afternoon tea
This is morning
All wealth yawning

And you dreamÉ (repeat)

Oblivious to my scheme
WhoÕll set the test
For your Unexpected Guest 

And as your Unexpected Guest 
Your hospitality 
Was the best 

Oh Englishman 
Your castle threatened
Your privacy wrecked 
Your wealth lessened 

And still he dreamsÉ

A midnight surprise 
Only for you eyes 
Your Unexpected Guest

Oh but I could have touched your shoulder
If I were bolderÉ 
The stranger in the bedroom 
The air would turn colder.
