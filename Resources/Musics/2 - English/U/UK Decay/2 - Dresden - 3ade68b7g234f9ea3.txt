DRESDEN

Dresden baby 
Where's the lesson to learn 
No source or reference 
All your evidence burnt 
Ashes the cinders they fall 
But no midnight deadlines
For your ball 
Because you're waiting
Oh, still waiting 

No witness left
The walls now deaf 
No witness left
To testify
Testify 
Who'll testify? 
Against your war crimes 

And they're waiting 
Oh, still waiting
Feeling for the cause 
Hands raised please
The lemmings fall
To take the call 
To sleep with ease

Stranger in danger
Calls aid to his side
He calls for a good Samaritan 
A protection of pride

The war, the spoils 
From cold turns to boil 
And we're waiting
Oh still waiting.

The epitaph 
The charred terrain 
The board wiped clean 
To try and start,
They'll start again 
Playing your war games

And we're waiting
Oh still waiting
They're feeling 
For the cause 
Hands raised please
The lemmings fall
To take the call
So sleep with ease
1980 Germany
1980 Germany 
Time moves on 
Predictions proved 
Wrong √ê again 
1980 Germany
And I'm still waiting.
