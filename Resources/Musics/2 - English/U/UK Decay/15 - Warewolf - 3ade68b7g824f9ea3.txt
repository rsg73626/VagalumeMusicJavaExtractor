WAREWOLF

When the light of the day is dead
The spark of night ignites
Beast Dormant inside
Comes alive

When imagination rules the head
Evoking instincts undead
The animal will rise to cry wolf

Victorious it breaks from the cage
Free from the man in his rage
Alive it cries wolf

Instincts
Instinct thinks from the heart
The savage tears apart

The beast
It bears some truth
But behind the man hides crying wolf
And it howls and he howls

Unto the feast he bares his teeth
Man into beast
Torn from the leash - savage man
Man is the beast aware
And it howls and he howls
Werewolf
