JERUSALEM OVER

Over the hill, over the hills
Vision
There are green fields far away
Over the white cliffs of dover
For jesus' aping caesars
Over the whit cliffs of dover

Satanic mills over the hills
Horizons new
See caesars aping jesus
With a bible or a gun
How the west was won
How the east began

Missionary for christ
Oh yeah...and england (in excelsis)
And jerusalem Jerusalem Jerusalem

Rising From the Dead
Killed once, killed twice
Double the crime, but you'll still pay the same price
For equality's stale when you can't fail
Newspapers read the same old story 
Hero to be hailed

Murder only accelerates death
Away you're led
But their consciences will be burning
When you're rising from the dead
You'll see them burn when you're rising
From the dead - dead

And I remember the jury screaming
Kill kill kill
I remember the screams running through my head
I remember the screams as the sentence was read
Kill kill kill

You're never too young or too old
When you're life is sold you'll swing from
The Gallows Pole
And who can argue once you've been nailed
If you hang too long it's the same old song
Justice always failed

And I remember the jury screaming
Kill kill kill
I remember the screams running through my head
I'll see them burn when I'm rising from the dead
Kill kill kill
Testament
Walking through the garden
Through the garden of temptation
Tempestuous in youth 
Seek the testament of truth

An angst that bears no sobs or self-pitied cries
He cherishes his one daily job with pride
The job to stay alive

Quest for reasons in empty hearts
Death the adventure when life's the bore
But in the face of defeat a lion roars

Statutes stand like statues
Laws stagnant in value
For the rulers of the ruled
The fools and the fooled

But should your carcass rot in a gutter
While your ideals go to heaven
When rebellion's the cause
Like a spartacus it's yours today
And tomorrow this testament will fall
Dying to be written
A new testament to be born

The lion roars, the lion roars
The lion roars as never before
in testament
