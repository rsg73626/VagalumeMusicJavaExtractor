UK DECAY

Battered britain just take a look
Your future hangs on a butcher's hook
Your union jack no longer rules the skies
It lies in shit, surrounded only by flies

You're watching it waste away
In the UK decay
Who wants to stay today
And see the UK decay

Inflation rise, your dole que grows
Unions dictate your fate no one knows
The countries stalled to melt a pay freeze
See the government it can only grovel on its knees

And watch it waste away
In the UK decay
Who wants to stay today
See the UK Decay
