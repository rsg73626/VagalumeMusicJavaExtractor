RISING FROM THE DEAD

Killed once, killed twice
Double the crime, but you'll still pay the same price
For equality's stale when you can't fail
Newspapers read the same old story 
Hero to be hailed

Murder only accelerates death
Away you're led
But their consciences will be burning
When you're rising from the dead
You'll see them burn when you're rising
From the dead - dead

And I remember the jury screaming
Kill kill kill
I remember the screams running through my head
I remember the screams as the sentence was read
Kill kill kill

You're never too young or too old
When you're life is sold you'll swing from
The Gallows Pole
And who can argue once you've been nailed
If you hang too long it's the same old song
Justice always failed

And I remember the jury screaming
Kill kill kill
I remember the screams running through my head
I'll see them burn when I'm rising from the dead
Kill kill kill
