ORANGE BOY

last night I went out for a movie
when I got home you were there
you were sitting on my front porch waiting to get in 

I don't know you 
you don't know me 
but I opened up the door 
you walked in you walked up the stairs 
as if so many times before 

don't even know your name 
now you're here I ask you where you came from 
you brush right by as you head straight for my room 
I asked you where you came from
but you didn't say a word 
no, you brush right by me 
as you head straight for my room 

I don't know you 
you don't know me 
but I opened up the door 
you walked in you walked up the stairs 
as if so many times before 
don't even know your name
