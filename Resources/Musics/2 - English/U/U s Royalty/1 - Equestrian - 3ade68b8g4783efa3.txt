EQUESTRIAN

I slept in hills of wheat and pine
Too many years have passed me by

I come down from the mountain

They offered me their finest wine
We danced and drank to pass the time

I come down from the mountain

And as the light crept up in the hills
I headed off for home
Memories of times spent away
Vanish into the sun
You were found
Living in the wild son
In the wild living with the wild ones
You were found living in the wild sun

I come down from the mountain
