KEEP IT COOL (BO FLEX REMIX)

Only you can know the way I'm feeling (x3) 

Only you can know 

Only you can know the way I'm feeling, 
Been a couple months but it seems so fleeting. 
Try to remember the way we were 
Couple of kids just trying to learn. 

Now I get to see you almost every day 
Try and try to tell you, oh, but it gets away from me,
all those words 
always slipping through my hands. 

Just take your time, cuz, 
Now I get to see you more and more each day. 
Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to. 

Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to. 
You keep on coming to 
Keep on coming to 

Everytime you come around things get so absurd. 
I try and try and tell you oh but you never learn. 
And its oh so easy, never thought it could be this way 
ohhhhh 

Just take your time, cuz, 
Now I get to see you more and more each day. 
Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know. 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to. 
Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to 

Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know(x3) 
Just keep it cool baby (x2) 
Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 

know (x9) 
kn-kn-kn-kn-know! 

Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to 

Just take your time, cuz, 
Now I get to see you more and more each day 
Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to 
Just keep it cool baby I don't want to know 
As long as I'm the one that you keep on coming to 
You keep on coming to 
Keep on coming to (x3)
