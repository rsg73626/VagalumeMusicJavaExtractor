FOOL TO LOVE (LIKE I DO)

Try to say good night as friends,
Wake up lovers in the Morning
Guess I shoulda stayed in bed,
But you know how I hate, to Be alone, its true
Ask you to please hear me out,
You say wait until Tomorrow
You can find me at Le Barricou,
I'll be drowning in my, Sorrows

What can I say
What can I say
Was I a fool to love you
What can I say
What can I say
Was I a fool to love you....like I do
Ooh Like I do, like I do, like I do

Is this what the scholars call, unrequited love
I'll take the sum of all the words I've said
Cash em in, for your heart, for you
Haven't slept a wink in days
Been flyin coast to coast
The jetlag my heart has felt
From loving you the most

What can I say
What can I say
Was I a fool to love you
What can I say
What can I say
I'm just a fool to love you....like I do
Ooh Like I do, like I do, like I do
