When your money's all gone
And your cold and all alone
The morning has come and you know
Now you can't go home
Won't you lead me to the depths of the ocean floor
And I said won't you lead me to the depths of the ocean floor
Where I, where I,
Where I hope to find rest some rest for my troubled soul
Where I hope to find rest some rest for my troubled soul
I said won't you lead me to the depths of the ocean floor
And I said won't you lead me to the depths of the ocean floor

We'll follow the trains out to the horizon
Take my hand lest we fall apart
We'll follow the trains out to the horizon
Take my hand lest we fall apart

With the sun on my face and the moon at my back
Inhabit each others dreams just for a while
With the sun on my face and the moon at my back
Inhabit each others dreams just for a while

Just lie in the grass with you and your sister
Remember a time when we could touch the stars
Just lie in the grass with you and your sister
Remember when we could touch the stars

Now won't you lead me to the depths of the ocean floor
