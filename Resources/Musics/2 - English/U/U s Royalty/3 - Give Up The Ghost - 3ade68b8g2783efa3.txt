GIVE UP THE GHOST

Winter wind chills me to the bone
I got a woman who can't seem to stay home
Taxman's knockin' at my door
And it's high high high time I hit the shore

Morning dew meets me on my way
Gotta find the little lady a place to stay
And this feeling oh this feelin in my veins
Oh its high high high time I hit the shore

Take me to the river
Plunge me to the murky depths
Seal my fate
With a kiss from your cold dead lips

Come home to these people hangin' round
Lord knows, don't wanna have to let em down
See my baby, she's gone and left me for good
And it's high high high time I reached the shore

Take me to the river
Plunge me to the murky depths
Seal my fate
With a kiss from your cold dead lips
Give up the ghost that you're feelin' most of the time
You must know you're always always on my mind
And I'm reelin', feelin' old
The healin', is takin' hold
Give up the ghost that you're feelin' most of the time

She had a way with words
Cut like diamonds but smoother than pearls
And I don't really know where she's been
And I don't no I don't really care where she's been

They're gonna say I'm getting too old
Out in the pasture just lookin for gold
And this feelin' oh this feelin' in my veins
Don't really know don't really care where it came

And it's high high high time I reached
The shore
