OLD FLAMES

If you go now, we could be better
No questions asked, at all
Beware when you're, trackin my, whereabouts
Who can who can who can who can
Remember why we came
No one no one no one no one
Will ever feel the same

Carry me through the fire, carry me through the fire
Too late too late too late
To ever feel the same

Welcome to, what is our new life
Old flames will pass
Killin' time till we, find what we're, lookin for
Who can who can who can who can
Remember why we came
No one No one No one No one
Will ever feel the same

Carry me through the fire
Carry me through the fire
Carry me through the fire
Who can who can who can
Remember why we came
No one No one No one
Will ever feel the same
