VACATION VACATION

I don't need from you another vacation
The last one we spent was all in vain
Got people asking me about our relations
If it's alright with you, I'd rather stay

Picture yourself among the scarlet canyons
Stars beam down like burning rays
The condition of my heart is far from stable
Time passes away like a dark refrain

We're just cool kids livin like the good times never end
We just day dream, waste away in a stoned out summer's end
We're just cool kids livin like the good times never end
We just day drink, waste away in a stoned out summer's end

They say we're cool kids, livin like the good times never end
We just day dream, waste away in a stoned out summer's end
So lazy, hazy on the things I might of said
We just move on, and move out until we find a friend
