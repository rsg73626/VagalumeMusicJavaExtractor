RAINCOATS

And lately when you're in my room
You take to singing my favorite tune
No, not the one by elvis costello
Oh, no wait yes, that's the one honey,
The one by leonard cohen

Oh, and now when I see you and your famous blue raincoat
I can't help but think of all the days that we won't be near, be near each other
I feel like everybody knows their place and where their going to go
If only I could find a way to piece tougher my thoughts for a day

And,
Come on, come on, come over

Come on over baby, I got your number
And I got a few things that I'd like to say to you
Don't forget about the way things were
I know it may be easy, but listen

Oh, and now when I see you and your famous blue raincoat
Can't help but think of all the days that we won't be near, be near each other
I feel like everybody knows
Their place and where their going to go
If only I could find a way to piece tougher my thoughts for a day

I feel like everybody knows
Their place and where their going to go
If only I could find a way to piece tougher my thoughts for a day
