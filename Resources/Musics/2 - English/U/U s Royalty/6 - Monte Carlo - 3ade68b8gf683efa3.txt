MONTE CARLO

Baby, don't keep runnin about
Goin' away for a while now why don't you call
And you tell me stories of your trips overseas
Fur laden beasts and diamond rings
Baby, don't keep runnin about

And when you see the light
Illuminate your eyes
Monte carlo you keep in your dreams
Along with horses, princes, and kings

And I know I can leave in the night
Just a moment in time, a moment in time
Don't be scared of what you find
In the night

And when you see the light
Illuminate your eyes
Monte carlo you keep in your dreams
Along with horses, princes, and kings

But I don't wanna leave in the night
Just a moment in time
Don't be scared of what you find
In the night

Come now, follow
Your heart, young american soul
I hear you crying out in the night
I hear your heartbeat, on these dead end streets
I hear you screaming out to the light
