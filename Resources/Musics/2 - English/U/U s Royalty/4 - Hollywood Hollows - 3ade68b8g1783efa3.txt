HOLLYWOOD HOLLOWS

Hot nights couldn't get that much longer
Bare boned in the heat of the summer
Red light flashes out of a window
Like alley cats we soak it up, we mix and we mingle

Stolen cars on the strip down at sunset
Livin days like these hours are tragic
Ask the kids on the street what's been shakin
How long till I waste away in hollywood hollows

Hey babe let's go to la
Head west don't delay
It's the witching hour
Your a west coast sensation
Standard deviation
Got your gold rush migration to pay

In the night oh her spirit she greets me
Visions, signs only serve to haunt me
White dove, on the wings she flies me
How long will I waste away in hollywood hollows

She won't let me be
La won't let me be
Set my soul free
She won't let me be

Hey babe let's go to la
Head west don't delay
It's the witching hour
Your a west coast sensation
Media fixation
Got your gold rush migration to pay
