Tell me about your love affairs,
Tell me about your moral resignations

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Tell me about your love affairs,
I want to know all the lurid details

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I want to die today,
And make love with you, in my grave,
I want to die today,
And make love with you, in my grave,
Aaaaaaaaalll aaallll alll day

Oh-oh-oh,
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah die

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

Is this love of ours alive?
Is it killing me alive?

Is this love of ours a lie?
Is it chemically derived, to ascertain?

I requested her refrain

Ah-ah-ah-ah

Is this love of our alive?

La-La-La-La-La-Live
La-La-La-La-La-Live
La-La-La-La-La-Live

Oooooo-ooooooh
