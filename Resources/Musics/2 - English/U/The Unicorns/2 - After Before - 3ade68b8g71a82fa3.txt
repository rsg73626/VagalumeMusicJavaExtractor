AFTER BEFORE

In this world of mysteries
With so many secrets yet to release
I held on to the seeds I knew
when I was younger than the day, when I grew
Witness this lonliness and how the empty
space caresses my emtpy face as I call the name.

I will be dreaming and I will remain the same.
Nothing here can open up the door.
And I will be wondering why this was meant to be.
What will come After Before??

Life a flash from a clear-blu sky.
The thought just struck me and it hurts so bad.
Now I wonder if it's worth to sigh.
Because I feel I'm going slightly mad.

Summer, autumn, winter, spring.
Is there something they will bring?
Anything new under the sun.
In my dreams I never stop to run.

I will be dreaming....
