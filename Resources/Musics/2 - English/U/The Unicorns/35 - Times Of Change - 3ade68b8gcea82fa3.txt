TIMES OF CHANGE

Father, are you leaving us this way?
Oh, I hope that you will come back one day.
Mother, tell him to stay, 'cause I don't want him to go away.

Just like a knife taking someone's life, pull the trigger to your gun.
Just like a knife taking someone's life, then the deed is done.

Times of change my friend, you know we got a land to defend.
And your father will return.
Until then the candle of hope will burn, it will burn.

Sister, can you believe the things that our father achieves.
Brother, can you understand, father is sent to save the land.

Just like a knife...

Times of change...
