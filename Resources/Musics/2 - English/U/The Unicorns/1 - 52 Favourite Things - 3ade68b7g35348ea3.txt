52 FAVOURITE THINGS

Headed to bed on sunday
Well that's ok
My birthday's a week away
Gonna (1) have a cake, (2) swim at the beach
(3) wake up early, & (4) go to bed late

(25) golden loyal dog by the (36) ground well
(38 ) fresh cut grass (42) ocean in the seashell
(44) burying robins in the backyard
(49) use potassium iodide to make slugs shrink and die
(51) blaming my sister, until i'm free, it's my 52 favourite thing,
Next to (52) being me.
