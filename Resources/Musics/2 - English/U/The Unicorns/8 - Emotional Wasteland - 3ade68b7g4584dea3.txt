EMOTIONAL WASTELAND

I wander the lonely sidewalks 
on the streets of wounded heart. 
Reality is gently pushed away. 
The echoes of your final words 
will never end in here. I wish 
that I could make them disappear. 

The parasite of broken dreams 
has found me and I'll die. 
I know who's got the cure, 
but I know she meant goodbye. 

Oh My, my emotional wasteland. 
All the warriors of my heart 
declared a war to fight the emptiness. 
Oh my. my emotional wasteland. 
all the citizens of my soul, let it 
flow and fill my heart again. Again. 

My battleship sets sails and goes where 
no man's ever been. There is no 
return this time I got to win. 
I travel places near and far where 
angels fear to tread. The way I live 
and how I feel like I'm already dead. 

I recall the happy years we had under 
the sun. But in the darkness where 
I am, all the happiness is gone. 

Oh My, My emotional wasteland...
