GHOST MOUNTAIN

when we climbed to the peak we planted a flag
but the moment we had, i felt bad
and then night came, so we got into our sleeping bags
and then someone told a story about something dead and gory 
there was heat
from the fire
but i still froze when i saw the ghost
        x2 
i told the gang we weren't welcome
the ghost made that clear
so we stepped back, but it was drawing near
and it lunged for our throats
so we packed our things, made tracks,
undid our footprints, even furled our flag, and.. 
we were gone! but what was on the top of the mountain,
the mountain top?
        x2 
sweet nothing! I made it up
so we would make it down with no claim on Ghost Mountain
