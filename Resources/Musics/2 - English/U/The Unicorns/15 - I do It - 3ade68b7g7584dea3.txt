I DO IT

Uh
I do it
I do it to you

(let's do it)

All you christians
All you krishnas
We do weddings & bar mitzvahs!
We'll float with your parade
(so long as we're getting paid)

No principles just vice principles!

We wouldn't lie
"you've got it made"
We'll tell you what you want as long as we get paid


Satisfy the bride
Fellate the groom
To inflate your party balloons /
We're gonna need a little bit more room
Sure i'm qualified
I'll do anything you say
As long as i'm getting paid

No principles, just vice principles

We wouldn't lie
You've got it made
We'll tell you what you want as long as we get paid

We'll proselytize around your thighs
This concert is sponsered by those french fries!!
