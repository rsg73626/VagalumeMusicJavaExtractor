TUFF GHOST

tuff ghost, tuff crowd, tuff love
sit down X3
        X2 
say something now
        X2 
the tuff ghost disappears for 3 days
the tuff ghost is set in his ways
i don't want to hurt you
GHOST
well you can't, 'cuz i'm already dead
the tuff ghost is invincible
no guts came out when he bled
GHOST
well i lift weights, but i don't sweat.
i go for a swim, but i don't get wet
i don't care about anyone else
i'm a strong dead man, looking out for himself
i think you're suffering, that's why you're so mean
you're already dead
i can't see right through you X8
