I DON'T WANNA DIE

i spotted the glow over the mountain, tonight
my turn to turn in just when the weather's getting nice
i predict: i die in a plane crash
i see it now, i die in a car on tour
and there's no one to stop this
nobody to loosen death's firm grip on me 
doo doo doo doo i die
it's true
doo doo doo doo i die
and so do you 
my prophecy is almost complete
my finger's on the pulse
(but where's the beat?)
we don't wanna die in the ocean
(drifting out to sea)
we don't want to die in our sleep
(ing bags)
DEATH buckle up boys, we're going for a little ride 
Death! I just want one more breath!
Can you grant me one more please?
