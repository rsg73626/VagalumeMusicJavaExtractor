INOCULATE THE INNOCUOUS

small doses, daily
absorbed and collected in the glands of fatty tissues over time 
somewhere in the asshole of my eye
there's a muscle which relaxes when you cry
somewhere in the eye of my brain
there's a muscle which makes me go... 
storage cells for hidden substance
but new flavours and aromas go on 
reflect on your absence
genuflect in my presence
remove your absess, they say it's cancer 
(flavourful, beautiful) 
bananas help me unwind
watermelon makes it awesome
