ELYSIAN FIELDS

There's a feeling
when I'm riding my horse
something special you can't say at all
there's a dream that I've got, that I've got
there's a dream that I've got, that I've got

there are fields where I'll go, where I'll go
there are fields where I'll go, where I'll go

Now your tears have gone down far away from that land
dreaming somehow of the time that we spent
hear, my ride is echoing aloud through that land
now I'm free and alive in that land

Sinking into the oblivion with me, myself and I
completely free and with my heavy metal still on me

there are fields where I'll go, where I'll go
there are fields where I'll go, where I'll go

Now your tears have gone down far away from that land
dreaming somehow of the time that we spent
hear, my ride is echoing aloud through that land
now I'm free and alive in that land

Tears have gone down far away from that land
dreaming some how of the time that we spent
hear, my ride is echoing aloud through that land
â€˜cause my dream is true now, in that landâ€¦
â€¦..this is my dream and now I'll go, now I'll goâ€¦..
