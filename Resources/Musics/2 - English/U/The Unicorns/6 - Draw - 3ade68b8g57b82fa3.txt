DRAW

Once again he's got the feeling.
But his dreams are always drained by the ceiling.
He keep on seeing this reflection and all he wants to do is
to follow its direction.

Nowadays he watches the sunrise.
Because it reminds him of her clear eyes.
If only he could feel her might.
It would help him through the night.
It would helphim find delight.

His mind is always set on her turning his mind into a blur.
The natural beauty he claims that she is cna never rebuild his departed
bliss.

When will he see her draw pictures of all they never saw?
When will he see her eyes closer them a dream away?

Everytime he sees the nightfall.
He believes that he can hear the wind call.
Winter came and time grew older.
And all he wanted to do was to hold her.
Never to run away again.

His mind is always set one her...

When will he see her draw pictures of...

When will he see her draw pictures of...
