PEACH MOON

sun-smudged peach moon
softer than an ice cream cone in june
and why is it that
lightning strikes so perfectly at night ?

what you do is what you choose
but consider consequences when you lose

all my life
i've been waiting for
a sign to say move on
and tonight
all the salt that's in the air just feels right

sun-smudged peach moon
softer than and ice cream cone in june
and why is it that
thunder purrs so strikingly at night ?
