SEA GHOST

I dove into that freezing sea,
With a parasite attached to me,
I'd hoped the salt below,
Would give us what was right above

But league after league,
It yet remained,
For the fleshy vessel I,
Kept it sustained

Buh-up-up-up-ba-ba-ba


So we froze, a while
Surrounded by one big tear,
Which really reminded me,
Of a former home

But we wern't welcome,
The sea made that clear,
By filling us with saline,
And sending us blue, blue, blue, back into...
...the atmosphere

You choked as you surfaced,
Tangled, in seaweed,
But what remained,
Of the driving intent,
But let me to tract,
Such watery depths

Many things have betrayed me,
Between there and here,
And my memory is so, so, so, fucking unclear

Who was I with, what time was it?
And where-ere-ere-ere
Who was I with?
What time was it?
And where-ere-ere-ere
Did you go?
