WILLIAM, CLAP YOUR HANDS

clap your hands if you want some
clap your hands if you can't wait

take your things i stole
they worked sufficiently but not great
i'd stay for scoldings but i am late

look if they're not there, then they've been sold
(is that not OK?)
William, it's your own fault

oh, let it rest on the sabbath day
learn to stand and sway (clap your hands it'll be ok)
dancez vous the night today
it's all gone anyway
