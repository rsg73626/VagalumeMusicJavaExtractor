THE CZARINA OF VERMILLION

Calling for the warlock that will lead us through the sparks.
Heading for the landscape where the otter never barks.
Creatures from the lost world they were playing hide and seek.
Look at all the crickets who's reflecting in the creek.

Then I saw the sky beneath all the trees,
bedazzled with mica, mesmerized by red,
who's baffling with my head?

The Czarina of vermillion.
She lives with the platypus who is a friend of Ghazh
The Czarina of vermillion.
Just by a sleight of hand, she holds the veil so grand I sigh.

Friendly is the beauty, she is talking like a dream.
Holding back the secrets, Ghahz is lying by the beam.

I talk so nice, about weather and rice but she is ignoring the fact.
Then I got mad, the ferrets are sad.
Czarina she opened the riddle.

Then I saw thing it shone colour bright.
Red as the dawn. Cut as the lawn.
The star is out of sight.

The Czarina of vermillion...

I have seen the entity
The crimson and the clown
Waiting for my turn to see the mica burn.
And tears have filled my yellow ice,
the mistery's been found, no more
mystery only history for all.
