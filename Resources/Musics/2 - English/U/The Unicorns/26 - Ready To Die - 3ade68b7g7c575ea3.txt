READY TO DIE

i woke up thirsty on an island in the sea
i woke up hungry with hungry cougars surrounding me 
i hit the soft spot on the soft spot on my head
it made me tired so i sung from my bed 
i'm ready to die X4
a sword, a switchblade, any way you cut it
i'm not afraid, i know i'm going to get it 
oh maker! (of such fine products
as palm trees, and the dead sea)
don't pardon me, there's nothing rude
things conclude, things conclude! 
as i slurred that chorus, the ghosts got biggie
small sounds like a drill
the death sweat suits me
a death threat provides a thrill 
i've seen the world, kissed all the pretty girls
i've said my goodbyes and now i'm ready to die.
