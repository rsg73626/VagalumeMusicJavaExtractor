THE SORROW SONG

My dreams are falling apart
And the wosrt is there is nothing I can do.
YOu have decided to leave and it hurts
because I'm still in love with you.
You can never imagine the pain that I feel.
Tears will never stop falling from my eyes.
There is no tomorrow. No future for me. It
feels like I want to die.

Just to make things up to me. Tell God I am
coming home. Jost to prove it wasn't only me
Tell God I'm coming home, tell God I'm coming home.

I still remember the days.
How you held me in your arms when I cried.
Why can't you feel the same??
Why has everything faded and died??
You can never imagine the pain that I feel.
Tears will never stop falling from my eyes.
There is no tomorrow. No future for me. It feels
like I want to die.

Why is there a world? Why am I alive?
Why is life so rough? Why do I try?
Take me a place where pain is denied
and tell me once again why have I tried.
Just to make things up to me, tell God I'm coming home.
Just to prove it wasn't only me, tell God I'm coming
home.
Nother here is what it used to be, so tell God I'm
coming home, tell God I'm coming home.

If a millionaire spends all his money. He still got a life
to live.
But if you're walking out on me honey.
I don't think I've got anything more to give.
It feels like you've flushed me down the drain. And I'll
suffer for years and years.
You offered me so much pain. How deep is the sea of
tears??
