I WAS BORN (A UNICORN)

[DIAMONDS:]
I was born a Unicorn
I missed the ark but I could've sworn 
You'd wait for me

[GINGER:]
I was born a Unicorn
I could've sworn you believed in me.
Then how come all the other Unicorns are dead?

Were never gonna stop
I think I wanna stop
We want one us
I dont care i'll do push-ups
I write the songs
I WRITE the songs
You said I'm doing it wrong
YOU ARE doing it wrong

[DIAMONDS:]
Put your crystals under my pillow
[GINGER:]
Send your epistle to my bedfellows

It also says!

When dreaming beasts are dying down, on out
They're there, for we agree they're there, They're there
for we agree they're there, alive and born.

[DIAMONDS:]
If I stop believing in you
[GINGER:]
If you stop believing in me
[DIAMONDS:]
If I stop believing in you
[GINGER:]
If you stop believing in me

We're the Unicorns.
We're more than horses.
We're the Unicorns
And we're people too!
