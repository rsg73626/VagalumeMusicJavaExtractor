LIQUEFY

I was crying in my dream one night, why I wish I knew.
You can be a pretty sight but I always feel black and blue.

I was dying in my dream one night.
I'm afraid that it will come true.
You were putting out my light but I guess I'm pulling through.

You.
I remember these words you said.
You.
I remember when you wore red.

The neverending cry.
Soon to liquefy into the sea of tears.
Don't you confirm my fears.
The neverending cry.
Soon to liquefy into sea of tears.
Don't you confirm my fears.

You were sighing in my ears those days.
I still remember lines.
I've been trying to rebuild a phrase, your words, were they the sign?

Cry, I'm dreaming away.
Why? A winter day in May.
You, I remember the words you said.

I've been looking for a place to go.
Where I can cleanse my fluid.
Looking for the place you showed.
Where I am stripped completely nude.

You...

The neverending cry...
