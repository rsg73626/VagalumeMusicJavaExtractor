MESSENGER

Deep in the dead of the night,
silhouettoes on my window, why?
I guess I will never know.
The themes will always come and go.

And I'm never gonna be the same.
Never gonna be the same again.
I know, you show the mage coming from a distant age.

Messenger of fear and pain, messenger of love.
Messenger of fear and pain, messenger of time.
Messenger of fear and pain, messenger of love.
Messenger of fear and pain, messenger.

I stand on a wave in time,
always searching for the clouded space.
I guess it will never show,
The theme will always be the glow.

And I'm never gonna be the same again,
Never gonna be the same again.
I show, you throw the page stolen from the human race.

Messenger of fear and pain...

Face the face of heaven (Face the face)
Caught within a spell.
Dreaming dreams if heaven (Dreaming dreams)
Dreaming dreams of hell.

Messenger of fear and pain...
