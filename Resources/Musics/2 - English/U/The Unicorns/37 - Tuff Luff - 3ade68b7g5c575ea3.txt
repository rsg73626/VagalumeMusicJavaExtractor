TUFF LUFF

firstly,
we lived in a crater where our eyes glowed
we secrete leaders of secrecy:
"hello" 
what do you picture makes a frame
what you do everyday is the same
turn off the lights and shake your hips
let's make like a couplet, like 2 pairs of lips 
pop goes the ceiling of routine
pop goes the feeling of sitting 
so blow your head on the turn of the fan
don't put another down payment on the oil of iran x2 
can't you see i've got honourable mention
can't you see you've got no pension plan? 
it's time to decide, we make it or we die x2 
hey nuclear war & a hotbed of trouble
make with the penance, repent on the double
we're going down in smoke and flames
we're going down and there's no one to blame 
so keep it cold in a cool dry place
in a tucked away space
save it with the face 
clean the egg, don't make me beg 
save us x30
