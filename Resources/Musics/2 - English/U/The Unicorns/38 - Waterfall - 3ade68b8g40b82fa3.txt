WATERFALL

Thinking of the days I've spent with you.
Recalling the things that we used to do.
YOu being around made me happy and full of life.

Something went wrong but I don't know why.
Our feelings were gone even though we tried,
to keep them alive we were drifting miles apart.

Waterfall, what was frozen then is now falling again
Waterfall, what was frozen then is now falling again
I'll live without you...

I follow my heart as it goes downstream,
maybe the outflow contains my dream?
Repressing the feelings that I might have for you.

Now I can fall asleep without you in my mind.

I've got more lifeblood than before.

Waterfall...
Waterfall...
I'll live without you...

Dream on
Dream on
and let the water fall into your soul...

Dream on
Dream on
and let the water fall...

Waterfall...
Waterfall...
Waterfall...
I'll live without you...
