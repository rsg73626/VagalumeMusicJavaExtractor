EVACUATIN SOMETHIN WARM

Something warm would be something nice
To keep me from moaning in the morning
And mourning through the night

Take your things from my house
Evacuate my life
It's over
Rescind

Everything's okay in its own little way
Everything's okay 

Clap your hands/clap your hands
Clap your hands if you want some

Clap your hands/clap your hands
Clap your hands if you can't wait
