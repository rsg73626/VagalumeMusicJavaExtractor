MAKE MY WAY (STUDIO VERSION)

Out of my day
I was walking it right
I was fill of my pound
I was fill of my pain

Now be 'cause out me
'cause I'm on my way
Something distance me
Disusing my day

I'm gonna stride
I'm gonna prove you wrong
This is my side
My life

I'm gonna make my way to this one
I'll find my way
I'm gonna stride
I've got nothing to lose
I'll make my way

Now that is pounding
Im falling on me
Pressure like this
Almost get into me
Now Im breaking the vanicy
You're holding me in
Got to start leaving
I got to begin

I'm gonna stride
I'm gonna prove you
Now that this is my side
My life

I'm gonna make my way to this one
I'll find my way
I'm gonna stride
I've got nothing to lose
I'll make my way
I'm gonna make my way to this one
I'll find my way
I'm gonna stride
I've got nothing to lose
I'll make my way

I'm gonna prove you're wrong
This is my side
My life
I'm gonna prove you're wrong
This is my side
My life
This is my life
