MAKE MY WAY

I was thinking of you
How you feel on you side?
Tell me 'cause i'll be
'cause i'm on my way
Looks like your charming
It tourns on my pain

I'm gonna stride
I'm gonna prove you
Oh, that this is my side
My life

I'm gonna make my way to this one
I'll find my way
I'm gonna stride
I've got nothing to lose
I'll make my way

Now that is falling
I'm falling on me
Pressure like this
Help me to get into me
Now i'm breaking the vanicy
You're holding me in
Got to start leaving
I got to begin

I'm gonna stride
I'm gonna prove you
Now that this is my side
My life

I'm gonna make my way to this one
I'll find my way
I'm gonna stride
I've got nothing to lose
I'll make my way

I'm gonna prove you're wrong
This is my side
My night
I'm gonna prove you're wrong
This is my side
My life
