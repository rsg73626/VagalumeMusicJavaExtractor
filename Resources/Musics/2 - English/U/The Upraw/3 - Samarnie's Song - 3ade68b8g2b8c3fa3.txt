SAMARNIE'S SONG

You left and you took my heart with you
Had believe that was nothing humiliant too
I gave myself I gave you every, everyting

This was happened again, again, again
Push me away again, again, again

(To me)
Floated when you give a smile
(I'd let you)
Thought on the inside
(and now)
I'd left you
(You left me)
Gonna ride all night
And you'd get on the other side
Now you gonna
Lied cant figure
And caught every, evey lie to me
My life has no mean
Passing me by
I let you do so

Push me away again, again, again
Push the way again, again, again

(To me)
Floated when you give a smile
(I'd let you)
Thought on the inside
(and right now)
I'd left you
(You left me)
Gonna ride all night
And you'd get on the other side
Now you gonna
You left and you took my heart with you
Had believe that was nothing humiliant too
I gave myself I gave you every, everyting

Push me away again, again, again
Push the way again, again, again

Floated when you give a smile
Thought on the inside
(and right now)
I'd left you
Gonna ride all night
And you'd get on the other side
Floated when you give a smile
Thought on the inside
(and right now)
I'd left you
Gonna ride all night
And you'd get on the other side

Floated when you give a smile
Thought on the inside
I'd left you
Gonna ride all night
And you'd get on the other side
