GHETTO GUTTER

[Chorus: U-God (w Autumn Rue)]
I tear the roof right off this mother (I give them ghetto gutter)
That venom, I put it (on you, I'll give them ghetto gutter)
[U-God]
In the big black Cadillac, no handles attached
Drunk off the super skunk, pass me a batch
My single's on the radio, turn it up blast
I'm comin' through, stomp it up, put it on smash
My Energizer bunny boo, how long can you last
She spazzed on my dashboard, I almost crashed
What more can you ask for? The honey or the cash?
But it's money over bitches when I hit her with the shaft
[Chorus 2X]
[U-God]
Rhinestone cowboys, ratchets on the waist
Cops roll by, blow the haze in they face
Heads in the staircase, fiendin' for the base
Almost made a sell but someone yelled out "Jake!"
Then I bailed out like I had on skates
Almost fell out, but I made it home same
Splash on some fragrance, grind on the Ave
Kid, I'm ghetto fabulous, when the news cameras flash
[Chorus 2X]
[U-God]
I got a project chicken, her head game is great
She part time stripper, she handles my weight
Liberian connection, stretch through out of state
With pure opium shipments, fresh from out the crates
She drive a brand new Lex', tan with no plates
Motor bay, predates, sell it for high rate
Let's go one time, baby, two to the brain
Legendary street weapon, back in the game
[Chorus 2X]
