TURBO CHARGE

Rocket on...to the break of dawn...elevation yo...

(Verse)
Elevation smell the vibration mystique beneath the beat cave in
Super freak meaty bone tones discreet goncha leave is a sweet sensation 
(egg is I) forsaken take over in 
the making live wire retire all great men 
mic-pope rope-a-dope (ma-des-en) intention 
Broke through your fences now this is the redemption
Nerve wrechin unstoppable high colossal 
tonsil obstacle-able hard to true bobbin
Shopping through no question 
honey I'm sexual intellectual (vamp) rhyming professional
Swing all the ladies in I directional potential bright clever and soft
Whatever more encore the shit you adore   hard  

[Chorus]
Cause its hard turbo charge and I'm doing shit my way 
Bon Voyage Shoalin dodge nigga I'm going shit my way 
Turbo charge nigga its hard cause I'm doing shit my way 
Yes its hard praise to god nigga I'm doing shit my way 

How it sounds now hold it down right down to the ground...

(Verse)
Pleasure the light mic the treasure strangers in the night 
Can't fight the spinning (lining) of pearl from left to right
Have guns (yo will) travel milky way dripping in the brisk 
At your own risk silver shadow 
That might lurk in the image in the Pharaoh when the road gets narrow 
An hour off after hour devour with the power the background amp 
Wine (your mission) to the party mix champ
Wu stamp genie out the lamp cramp sex position 
Exposition body count technician bets deep rising ask killa-shit 
Wax __-ize this courage of the fearless wu enterprise sent to risen 
Grand prize landslide pipe in holy lighting told me I'm frighten 
Goldie the only __ speaking that excitement

[Chorus]

(Verse)
I feel the earth moving under my feet
I feel the crowd come tumbling down how it sound all around now 
We going to party now hold it down 
we going to party-hardy right down to the ground
