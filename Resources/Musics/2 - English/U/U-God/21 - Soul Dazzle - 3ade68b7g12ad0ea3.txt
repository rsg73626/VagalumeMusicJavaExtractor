SOUL DAZZLE

(U-God) 

On the mat  head to toe
intacked on the track
big hat's on the go
let them hoe's no we on the stro
we on the track
the shit we started we comin back
in the market of rap
walkin man heart talkin
superbowl race suna-so-king
roll the red carpet
out the cockpit
sharks are gettin darmit
come out the closet  "ROCKS!"
my pocket's don't understand lin 
place's i haven't been
this is it HollyWood handprint 
written isn't it
bottum is get that lid
get that money not the honey rent
need to feed is more legale
ya too foxy ass
get that cash 
"spounce" can flower eagle

(U-God)

(Chorus)


Soul Soul need a taste
my right
head in the right place
do what to do like
you suppose to be
now give up your change
before the game's on me
now bouce can you dig it?
on the real side
stay in the showcase
be satisfied 
now meet me at the big house
that i tair down
let everybody know
that everybody know
that i made you squise
da hit your sound
 now bounce get up and do  nigga's what you can
everybody do what ladie's what you can
"right" 28 fizik 
gang don't mean nothing me
 you can't run high
 the games on me 
"right" can you dig it?

(U-God)

it's just the vocab
 get the gab 
like the river they call me 
"rhymen" money on the wood
go good right before Just 60 notum
trick ass bitch nigga dimen'ts
put her arm in perfect timen
sweet signs a sin
steady climbin
alway's preferance food on the table
on the move
hash flourish
ever since thang prove
my stable every move is faital
my step gonna survive
no jock 
talkin GMC
see the C bring it back to me
if it's alright with you it's alright with me
we could do like men how you wanted it to be
that shiny shake that blind makes chamber's like pineapple grape
no time to escape
pimps slap your face
on the hole is soul in the hole
roll now blow

(U-God)

(Chorus)

Soul Soul need a taste
my right
head in the "right" place
do what to do 
like you suppose to be
now give up your change
before the game's on me
now bounce can you dig it?
on the real side 
stay in the showcase be satisfied
now meet me at the big house
that i tair down
let everybody know
that everybody know
that i made you squise
da hit your sound
now bounce get up and do  nigga's what you can
everybody do what ladie's what you can
"right" 28 fizik
gang don't mean nothing me
 you can't run high
 the games on me
