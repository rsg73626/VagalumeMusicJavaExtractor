RISE UP

Let the light shine on my face
As we rise up to a brand new day
I can see clearly there is hope, there is hope

It's been a mystery to me
Where I am and where I'll be
The day you opened up my eyes, I'm alive

Ooh, rise up and rise up again
Ah, oh let the journey begin
Ooh, rise up and rise up again
Ah, it's time to let the love in

I've been calling you in life
To fill this empty space inside
You are the way, the truth, the life
Bringing me to my father

You're everything I need
To fill me up and make me see
The day you opened up my eyes... to shine

Ooh, rise up and rise up again
Ah, oh let the journey begin
Ooh, rise up and rise up again
Ah, it's time to let the love in

One, one
We can be one together, forever
One, one
We can be one together, forever

Ooh, rise up and rise up again
Ah, oh let the journey begin
Ooh, rise up and rise up again
Ah, it's time to let the love in
Oh let the journey begin
Oh let the journey begin
