BROTHER TO BROTHER

There's a cause that's right for you
You're made for it to see it through
Do you have the strength to journey on
To walk the walk, and see it done
And it's up to us to bring it on
Gone are the days we sit around
The time is now

From a man who has learned through many years
To the one who will face uncertain fears
We stand, brother to brother
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We raise the flag across the land
We will make a change, a change
Brother to brother

It's a dream that we can make
Can you feel it now, its gonna take
An attitude from me and you
To love the ones who don't love you
Now's the day to break the chains
Gone are the wounds that never heal
We can make this real

From a man who has learned through many years
To the one who will face uncertain fears
We stand, brother to brother
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We raise the flag across the land
We will make a change, a change
Brother to brother

What can we do to bring all of the truth
And let out the banner unfurled
What can we do to live all this truth
And carry the light to the world

From a man who has learned through many years
To the one who will face uncertain fears
We stand, brother to brother
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We raise the flag across the land
We will make a change
From a man who has learned through many years
To the one who will face uncertain fears
We will make a change, a change
Brother to brother
