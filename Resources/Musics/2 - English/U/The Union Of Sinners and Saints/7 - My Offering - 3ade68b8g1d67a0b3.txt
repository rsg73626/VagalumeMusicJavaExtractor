MY OFFERING

We stand here all alone
We see this world we know
Another face just in the crowd
Our dreams fall to the ground

Been searching near and far
Still looking for that shining star
Your disapointments never end
Where do we begin, begin

So take me, use me, mold me, and make me
Into the one I should be
And teach me, show me, lovingly change me
Into the one I can be
This is my offering

So hold your light for all to see
This gift is there for you and me
So come one, oh come ye all
At his feet we fall
Hear his call

So take me, use me, mold me, and make me
Into the one I should be
And teach me, show me, lovingly change me
Into the one I can be
So take me, use me, mold me and make me
Into the one I should be, this is my offering

So come now and see, the king of all kings
The lord of our hearts has come before us

So take me, use me, mold me, and make me
Into the one I should be
Yeah teach me, show me, lovingly change me
Into the one I can be, yeah
And teach me, show me, lovingly change me
Into the one I can be, this is my offering
My offering, my offering
