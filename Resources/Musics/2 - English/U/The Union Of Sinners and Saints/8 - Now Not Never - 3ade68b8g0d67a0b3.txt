NOW NOT NEVER

You're not on your own, we're here together
Chasing down a dream, it's now not never
Following our hearts through storms together
Almost made it there it's now not never

This journey covers many miles and roads
And where it leads no one knows
It's got you drifting through
The motions in fields of grey
It keeps you running back to yesterday, yesterday

You're not on your own, we're here together
Chasing down a dream it's now not never
Following our hearts through storms together
Almost made it there it's now not never

I took this train at such an early age
A one way ticket outta here
These wheels are stirring up the dust of the past
Feels there's no escaping yesterday, yesterday

You're not on your own, we're here together
Chasing down a dream it's now not never
Following our hearts through storms together
Almost made it there it's now not never

When life puts you down on your back
You say you give up, don't know where you're at
But when you've got someone praying for you
Ya never know what that prayer will do

You're not on your own, we're here together
Chasing down a dream it's now not never
Following our hearts through storms together
Almost made it there it's now not never
