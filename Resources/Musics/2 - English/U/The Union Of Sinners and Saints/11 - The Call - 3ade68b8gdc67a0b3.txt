THE CALL

Remember who you were
Before things started changing
We color outside the lines
Give a little more than all we are taking
It's a message of our times

'cause time, like a shifting wind
But the message never changes
How do we face this call

It's a call for every heart that's broken
It's a journey we all make
It's a call for every song unwritten
It's a step that we must take

We are older, but are we really wiser?
Is that not how it s supposed to be?
As we look down the ages
And while we turn the pages
The call is there, it's clear to see
How its meant to be

It's a call for every heart that's broken
It's a journey we all make
It's a call for every song unwritten
It's a step that we must take

It's a call for every heart that's broken
It's a journey we all make
It's a call for every song unwritten
It's a step that we must take

Every time I seize the day
Is one more time to see your face
Every time I seize the day
Is one more time to see your face
It's the call, it's the call
