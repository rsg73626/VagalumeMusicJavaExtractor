With a will and a way
Hard to stay in humility
What we want and we need
Oh it's hard to see, hard to see

Oh it's bittersweet
The things we need to make us all complete
Oh it's bittersweet
The key we need, surrender to be free

Oh, yeah it's bittersweet
The things we need, the truth that makes us whole
Oh, it's bittersweet
The key we need
The love that brings us home

I'm lost in the maze
Turn the page
And as we go deeper the fear keeps us hear
We draw near, gotta let it go, let it go

Oh it's bittersweet
The things we need to make us all complete
Oh it's bittersweet
The key we need, surrender to be free

Oh, yeah it's bittersweet
The things we need, the truth that makes us whole
Oh it's bittersweet
The key we need
The love that brings us home

So open up your mind
And don't believe the lie
So open up your mind, open up your soul
And don't believe the lies

Time to come back home
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet
The things we need - it's bittersweet
Surrender, the truth that makes us whole
The love that brings us home, brings us home
