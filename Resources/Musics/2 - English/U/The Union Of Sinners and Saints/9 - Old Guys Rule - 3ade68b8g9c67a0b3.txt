OLD GUYS RULE

Put the needle down and feel the groove
The sound is something and it makes you move
You had a message that was coming through
Check it out

It was all about the human race
And being part of what was taking place
Making choices that we had to face
Then is now

Old guys rule, we ain't fools, old guys rule

You say its different but its all the same
End up playing all these stupid games
Now you only got yourself to blame
Who's the fool?

Don't let people try to put you down
'cause everything will always come around
We saw it then like we see it now
It's so cruel

Old guys rule we ain't fools, old guys rule

Wisdom is nothing to laugh about
Too often we throw it away
The value of all this experience
Is something we all should embrace

Don't let anybody put you down
'cause everything will always come around
We saw it then like we see it now
Then is now, then is now

Old guys rule, we ain't fools
Old guys rule
Old guys rule, old guys rule
We're all the fools
