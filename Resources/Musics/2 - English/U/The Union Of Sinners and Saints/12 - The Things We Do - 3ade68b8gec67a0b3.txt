THE THINGS WE DO

You came along
And you broke my heart to pieces
You came along
And you broke my heart to pieces
Ooh, yeah

It's not the words that you say
But in the things that, things that you do
It's in the way that we live
We all gotta give it to, give it to
The things we do, the things we do

You came along
And you broke my heart to pieces
You came along
And you broke my heart to pieces
Ooh, yeah

It's not the words that you say
But in the things that, things that you do
It's in the way that we live
We all gotta give it to, give it to
It's not what you say
There you go kicking down the door
What you waiting for? waiting for?

It's not the words that you say
But in the things that, things that you do
It's in the way that we live
We all gotta give it to, give it to
The things we do, the things we do
