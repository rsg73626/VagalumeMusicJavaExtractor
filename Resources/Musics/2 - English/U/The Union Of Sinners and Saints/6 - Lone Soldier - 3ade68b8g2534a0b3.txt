LONE SOLDIER

Hello Father, good to be back home
Hello Father, cuz I've been on my own
And it's been hard
Walking this by myself
This lonely road seems so cold

Tell me Father is there something you can say
Tell me Father, there's gotta be a better way
Cuz dreams are clouds that seem to slip on through
Can't find the key to this mystery

Don't turn away - Don't toss the hope of a lone soldier
Cuz it ain't over til you find what is there for you
Don't think you're done cuz voices say that it's over
Just be bolder, we've all got a gift to use

Teach me Father, there's so much I can learn
Teach me Father, walk me through every turn
I'm oh so ready, please take me through this land
This land of hope is where I stand

Don't turn away - Don't toss the hope of a lone soldier
Cuz it ain't over til you find what is there for you
Don't look around just keep the way straight as an arrow
The path is narrow but it's wide enough for you

Gotta let it go and trust how big it is
The road is long and winds and it seems it never ends
Gotta let it go and trust how you will lead
He gives us what we need

Don't turn away, don't toss the hope of a lone soldier
Cuz it ain't over til you find what is there for you
Don't think you're done cuz voices say that it's over
Just be bolder we've all got a gift to use

Don't turn away don't toss the hope of a lone soldier
Cuz it ain't over til you find what He has for you
Don't look around just keep the way straight as an arrow
The path is narrow but it's wide enough for you

But it's wide enough for you
