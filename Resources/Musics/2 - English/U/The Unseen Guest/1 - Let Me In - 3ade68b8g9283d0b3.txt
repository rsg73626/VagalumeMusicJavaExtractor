LET ME IN

The days run together
They crowd at your front gate
But you can't let them in
So you tell them to wait

And one by one
They file up the driveway
And your bell is still ringing
As down goes the day

So you take off your shoes
And you turn up the volume
And they all go to sleep
While you're safe in your room

And in your bed at night
A stranger sleeps beside
And she opens your wardrobe
And she fumbles inside

Let me in, let me in
Or ill blow your house down
Let me in, let me in
Cause there's snow on the ground
I won't wait here forever
And then you will see
You should never say never
'Cause I sow what you reap

They huddle on your doorstep
As the clouds start to break
And they scratch at your windows
And they bang on your gate

And they walk on your doormat
With wet muddy shoes
And now and then the lights go out
'Cause they've stolen the fuse

And sometimes in the night
You answer the phone
And they breathe down the line
Just to see if you're home

They sing in your garden
Like dogs when the fight
And the noise that they make
Drills holes in the night

Let me in, let me in
Or ill blow your house down
Let me in, let me in
Cause there's snow on the ground
I won't wait here forever
And then you will see
You should never say never
'Cause I sow what you reap
