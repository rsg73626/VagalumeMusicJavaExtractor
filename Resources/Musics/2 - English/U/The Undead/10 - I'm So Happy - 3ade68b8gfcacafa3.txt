I'M SO HAPPY

She's got me feeling up
When the world's been bringing me down
And there's nothing on my mind except leaving town

From the first time that I saw her
I knew I was gonna love her
And there was no doubt about it
Yeah, there was no doubt about it
And there is no doubt about it anymore

I knew that look on her face
Said she wanted to go back to my place
And there was no doubt about it
Yeah, there was no doubt about it
And there is no doubt about it anymore

I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm in love again
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm in love again
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm in love again

From the first time that I saw her
I knew I was gonna get her
And there was no doubt about it
And there was no doubt about it
And there is no doubt about it anymore

I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm in love again
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm in love again
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I'm in love again

I knew that look on her face
Said she wanted to go back to my place
And there was no doubt about it
Yeah, there was no doubt about it
And there is no doubt about it anymore
Anymore
Anymore
