I WANT YOU

You came into my life
Through the corner of my eye
I hoped that you would save me from the one that made me cry
 
I'm much too shy, so I keep my distance
Other guys come on to you
But your smile breaks down my resistance 
And when I tell you
You know I'll be true
 
Don't you know that 
I WANT YOU to be my girl
I won't be happy til you say you love me
More than anything in the world
I WANT YOU to be my girl
 
Before today I was so lonely I wanted to die
But when your smile touched my eyes
You know, girl, you know I nearly cried
 
Don't you know that 
I WANT YOU to be my girl
I won't be happy til you say you love me
More than anything in the world
I WANT YOU to be my girl
 
BE MY GIRL

BE MY GIRL

BE MY GIRL
