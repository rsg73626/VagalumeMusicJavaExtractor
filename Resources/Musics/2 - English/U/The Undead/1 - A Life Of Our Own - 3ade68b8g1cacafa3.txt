A LIFE OF OUR OWN

We were raised by a computer, we never had no mom or dad
And the rest of our life story is surely just as sad
Abandoned by the ones we loved in a world we couldn't understand
We never had no reasons, so we never made no plans

And now we're speeding down life's highway in white vinyl and chrome
But someday we're gonna live a life of our own

We always got in trouble with the teachers in our schools
We never respected nothing, never followed any rules
Outcasts at an early age, the first kids on the moon
I guess we found out a little too late, we grew up a little too soon

And now I guess we can't buy a split level home
But someday we're gonna live a life of our own

A life of our own
Now we're speeding down life's highways in white vinyl and chrome
But we're never gonna live a life of our own

We always got in trouble with the teachers in our schools
We never respected nothing, never followed any rules
Outcasts at an early age, the first kids on the moon
I guess we found out a little too late, we grew up a little too soon

And now I guess we can't buy a split level home
But someday we're gonna live a life of our own

A life of our own
Now we're speeding down life's highways in white vinyl and chrome
But we're never gonna live a life of our own
A life of our own
A life of our own
A life of our own
A life of our own
