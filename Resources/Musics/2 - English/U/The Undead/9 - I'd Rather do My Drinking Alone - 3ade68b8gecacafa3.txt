I'D RATHER DO MY DRINKING ALONE

It's quarter past eight 
And if you think that's not late
It's early in the morning, you see
And though the bar should be closed
Bartender knows that since my baby left me
I got no other place to be goin'
I'd rather do my drinking alone

Now, all my old pals 
Are spendin' time out with their gals
But I got no one sitting on my knee
But since my baby went away
This is where I want to stay
And the only thing I want to see
Is that girl saying she'll be going home
And I'd rather do my drinking alone

Me and my sweet girl, we made such a team
Everyone said we had it all
But since she's been missing
I got no lips to be kissin'
And half a team ain't no team at all

Now it's quarter past ten
And I'm back here in the morning again
Hoping that she'd come back to me
But with each sip of beer
I cry another silent tear
Remembering the way things used to be
And I'll be here after everyone is gone
And I'd rather do my drinking
I'd rather do my thinking
I'd rather do my drinking alone
