STRANGE CREATURES

Strange creatures under my bed
Strange creatures hiding in the dark
Red, glowing eyes staring at me
Strange creatures that I can't see

I wake up screaming in the middle of the night
I had a dream; a terrible fright
What's behind the door, I saw it move
They're waiting to kill me

Red, glowing eyes staring at me
Strange creatures that I can't see

Strange creatures under my bed
Strange creatures hiding in the dark
Red, glowing eyes staring at me
Strange creatures that I can't see

Strange creatures under my bed
Strange creatures hiding in the dark
Strange creatures under my bed
Whoa
