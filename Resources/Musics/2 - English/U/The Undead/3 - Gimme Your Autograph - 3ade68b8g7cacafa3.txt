GIMME YOUR AUTOGRAPH

Gimme your autograph
This one's gonna be your last
Gimme your autograph

You were my favorite star
It blew my mind the way you played your guitar
I followed you through every trend
But tonight that's gonna end

Gimme your autograph
This one's gonna be your last
Gimme your autograph

(Oh) I played your records through high school
(Oh) I always wanted to be like you
(Oh) They say that I'm to blame
They say that I'm insane
My only claim to fame was you

(Oh) I played your records through high school
(Oh) I always wanted to be like you
(Oh) They say that I'm to blame
They say that I'm insane
My only claim to fame
My only claim to fame
My only claim to fame was you
