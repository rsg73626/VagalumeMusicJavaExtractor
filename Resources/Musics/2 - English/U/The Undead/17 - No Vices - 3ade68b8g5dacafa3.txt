NO VICES

No vices
How boring it would be if we had
No vices
What a drag to be straight all day and night
No drinks, no drugs, no sex, nothing

No vices
How boring it would be if we had
No vices
I'm down on my knees
Give me a drink, a pill, a smoke
Anything, I'm bored to death

No vices
How boring it would be if we had
No vices
I'm down on my knees
Give me a drink, a pill, a smoke
Anything, I'm bored to death
