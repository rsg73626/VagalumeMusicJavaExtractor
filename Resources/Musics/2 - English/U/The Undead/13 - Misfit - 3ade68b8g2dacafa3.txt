MISFIT

Walkin' down the street
The people that I meet
You always fucking glare
But you just be aware
I ain't no fuckin' fool
I graduated from high school
And I held a nine-to-five job
But I couldn't live working for some filthy rich slob

Fucking people that I see
Always fucking staring at me
I wonder what it is you see
Some freak from a menagerie

Nothing ever came to me
But all the pain I got for free
You wouldn't give me a hand
But you sure gave me all of your demands
All the other girls and boys
Came around showing off their shiny new toys

Fucking people that I see
Always fucking staring at me
I wonder what it is you see
Some freak from a menagerie

Fucking people that I see
Always fucking staring at me
I wonder what it is you see
Some freak from a menagerie

Nothing ever came to me
But all the pain I got for free
You wouldn't give me a hand
But you sure gave me all of your demands
All the other girls and boys
Came around showing off their shiny new toys

Fucking people that I see
Always fucking staring at me
I wonder what it is you see
Some freak from a menagerie

Fucking people that I see
Always fucking laughing at me
Well, laugh all you want, well, that's just fine
'Cause the last laugh is gonna be mine
