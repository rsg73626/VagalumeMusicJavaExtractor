I DON'T WANNA FEEL THE PAIN ANYMORE

I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore

I sit at home and wonder why
I let a bitch like you make me cry
'Cause I've got better things to do
Than waste my time thinking about you

I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore

You took advantage of the trust we had
And when I caught you, girl, you got mad
But I won't get down on my knees
Just to please you, girl

I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore

I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore

You took advantage of the trust we had
And when I caught you, girl, you got mad
But I won't get down on my knees
Just to please you, girl

I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
