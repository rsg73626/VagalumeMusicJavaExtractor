SHADOWS

Lost in fantasies within my mind
I was running; I was blind
None dare warn me of the curse that would befall
Laughing at the threat I did not heed at all

Sold my soul to this addiction
Causing me to lose my mind
Now you'll see my resurrection

Through dark passageways, beyond locked doors
Though I had been through hell, there would be more
Robbed of all emotion, no, I didn't care
Frightened by the shadows of what hid there

I saw those shadows creeping 
Up on me to rob my will
But now that shadow's beaten
And I've come back stronger still

Drowning in a sea of darkness
Damned by all I knew
Seduced by promises
That never could come true
Starved and penniless
Left in the street to die
Never knowing what it meant
And never asking why

I saw those shadows creeping 
Up on me to rob my will
But now that shadow's beaten
And I've come back stronger still
