ROCK'N'ROLL WHORE

Let me tell you a story
About how this all came to be
How I came to be the thorn on the Rock'nRoll family tree

Every line you fed me
Well, the story just don't fit
'Cause you're just looking for a sucker
And it don't amount to shit

You're all looking for the same individuality
You all want to be different
Like you, and just like me

I sold a million records, and I'm still fucking poor
But you keep on thinking that I'm just another Rock'nRoll Whore

I played a lot of gigs
And I always got laid
I sold a shitload of records
But I never got paid
After twenty-something years, wonderin' what's it all for

When the man in the suit comes in
And tells me that I'm great
Then he tries to change me
After taking the bait
After twenty-something years of people slamming the door
It all comes down to being a Rock'nRoll Whore

So now I'm playing to a packed house
But I still can't get a deal
And all the A&R wannabes are sleeping at the wheel
We really wanted to see you play
We're really sorry we missed it
I know you're really not sorry at all
And I know that I'm being blacklisted

And when I think about all the limits I have tested
If I walked the street naked I still couldn't get arrested
To be on some compilation, is all I wrote this song for
So I guess that makes me just another Rock'nRoll Whore

And if the money and the women are all I'm in it for
I guess that means I'm just another Rock'nRoll Whore
Yeah... I guess that means I'm just another Rock'nRoll Whore
