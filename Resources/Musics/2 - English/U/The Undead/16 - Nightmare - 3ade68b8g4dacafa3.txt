NIGHTMARE

I saw it in their faces
I read it in the magazines
People lost and shattered
Stranded in the dark

It only happens to the ones
Who got little to begin with
I can't understand it, I never will
Annihilation without a cause

Houses turned to rubble
Streets struck down without a care
Schools and cathedrals
Erased with frightening ease

It only happens to the ones
Who got little to begin with
I can't understand it, I never will
Annihilation without a cause

The speed of this disaster
Allows nobody to escape
Victims without weapons
Are always easy prey

It only happens to the ones
Who got little to begin with
I can't understand it, I never will
Annihilation without a cause

So tell me is this justice
Do some get fat without a care
Save your god and fuck your laws
We're running out of graves

It only happens to the ones
Who got little to begin with
I can't understand it, I never will
Annihilation without a cause
