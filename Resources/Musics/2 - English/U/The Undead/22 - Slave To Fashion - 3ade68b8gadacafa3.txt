SLAVE TO FASHION

All the magazines tell me what I want
But I'm too helpless to decide just what I like
All the billboards, blinded by the flashing lights
And I am mortified by egotistic obsession

I'm a slave to fashion
I'm a slave to fashion, whoa oh whoa oh

Living an illusion of reality
Trying hard to be someone who is not me
Social bulimia, isn't that the key
Swallowing the greed they feed and puking out my bucks to be

I'm a slave to fashion
I'm a slave to fashion, whoa oh whoa oh
I'm a slave to fashion
I'm a slave to fashion, whoa oh whoa oh

All the clothing, all the stores
All the junkies, all the whores
I don't wanna be the same
Put a bullet in my brain

All the magazines tell me what I want
But I'm too helpless to decide just what I like
All the billboards, blinded by the flashing lights
And I am mortified by egotistic obsession

I'm a slave to fashion
I'm a slave to fashion, whoa oh whoa oh
I'm a slave to fashion
I'm a slave to fashion, whoa oh whoa oh
