WE COULD BE FRIENDS

We could be friends if we'd only know 
a little bit about each other 
we could be friends and then we would know 
more and more about each other 
we could have good times going 
we could do so many things together 

Hey, look at me, I'm just one of a hundred people 
that you've met today, but all of them just looked away 
why would no one simply say: 
We could be friends if we'd only know 
a little bit about each other 
we could be friends and then we would know 
more and more about each other 
we could have good times going 
we could do so many tings together 

I'm sure that I have seen you before 
'cause you got a thousand faces 
my unknown friend I see you any time 
and at a thousand places 
don't you think we should get together 
that way we could do much better
