GERMANS

Germans -- go out ridin' with their ladies
Germans -- in their elegant Mercedes
Germans -- have a country that is scenic
Germans -- drive from Hamburg down to Munich

Germans -- like Fritz and Franz and Edeltraut
Germans -- they eat a lot of sauerkraut
Germans -- they like pretzels with teir wurst
Germans -- they drik beer until they burst

The say 'Guten Tag' and they say 'Auf wiedersehen'
they race down the Autobahn through acid rain
they take lots of Deutsch Marks right out of their pockets
to buy russian vodka and american rockets

Germans -- gave you Goethe, Mann and Schiller
Germans -- and Franz Kafka was a thriller
Germans -- brought you Mozart, Bach and Schumann
Germans -- they're a little superhuman

Germans -- have respect for law and order
Germans -- live on both sides of the border
Germans -- in Berlin they have a wall
Germans -- for playing tennis it't too tall

The blond german Fr√§ulains are pretty, but vain
you say 'Guten Tag' and they say 'Auf wiedersehen'
they're very hard workers, from monday to friday
make love an the weekends, and yodel like Heidi

Jawohl -- living in Germany is very nice
we're masters of war, we've tried it twice
and now we're on standby for World War III
prost and auf wiedersehen, Germany!
