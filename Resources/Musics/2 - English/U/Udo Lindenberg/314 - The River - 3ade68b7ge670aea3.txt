THE RIVER

I found my home by the river 
this is a real home to me 
the river is my friend and teacher 
makes me understand and see 

I use to sit on the banks of the river 
and watch the waters drifting by 
with a quiet song the river flows along 
I can hear it laugh and cry 

Now that I've learned the art of listening 
I hear the river talk to me 
a thousand voices in the whispering water 
now that I've learned the art of watching 
a thousand pictures I can see 

So many faces in the quiet moving river 
faces of people and some of them I've known 
I hear the voice of a fried and of my long lost wife 
I hear the moans of dying 
and the laughter of life 

I hear the call of longing - the cry of pain 
tender words of a loving woman - and the curse of a man 
I see my good old father - I meet my warm caring mother 
and all the pictures and all the voices flow into each other 

Isn't life like the water 
spring, brook and waterfall 
proud and mighty currents 
kissed by the warm shining sun 

but there are also other days 
when icy cold streams and frantic rapids 
push through dark narrow channels 

I see the setting sun reflected in the dancing waves 
so sure of coming back again 
I see the water rising up to the clouds 
and returning with the rain 

But whatever happens - the river flows on 
and nothing can stop its course 
until the distant goal is reached 
all the pictures, sounds and voices 
the whole wild world is in the current 
the river of life is bound to reach the deep deep ocean 
the ocean of Nirvana
