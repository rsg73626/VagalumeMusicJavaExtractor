LOVER MAN

I don't know why but I'm feelin' so sad
I long to try something I've never had
never had no kissin', oh what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh where can you be

The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
got a moon above me, but no one to love me
Lover man, where can you be

I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
can be like a heayenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer that you'll make love to me
strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears
then whisper sweet little things in my ears
huggin' and a-kissin', oh what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh where can you be
