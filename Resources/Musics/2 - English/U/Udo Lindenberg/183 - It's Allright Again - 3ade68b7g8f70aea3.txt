IT'S ALLRIGHT AGAIN

Legs are moving I look at them 
is it me, is it another man 
many answers I can find 
is it me, is it another mind 
I'm sittin' here and I feel so free 
the only thing that bothers me 
is a yellow spotted venus-man 
but else it is allright again 

Watch the people passing by 
see them running, they almost fly 
I keep smiling, I stay cool 
when they call me 'useless fool' 
I'm sittin' here and I feel so free 
the only thing that bothers me 
is a crazy grinnin' pelican 
but else it is allright again
