HORIZON

Though the foggy weather
with our hats pulled down above our eyes
we would lurk together
like detectives or a pair of spies
two like you and me
we could not be beat
just like lightening and thunder
always on another odyssey

And we were friends forever
when we crossed our hearts - a deal was made
we didn't know the weather was turning bad,
'til we felt the rain
then it hit me hard
caught me off my guard
- I was fallin' fast
but a love like ours, has gotta last

Refrain:

I know beyond the far horizon
there's a brand new day
we could be on the far horizon
we'll find the way
'cause our bond has ran so deep
is a bond we have to keep
forever together, wherever we are
