ILLUSIONS

Love is a game
you better play according to the rules
and yet we always scheme to much
and dream to much, we fools

Want to buy some Illusions ?
slightly used second hand ?
they were lovely illusions
reaching high, built on sand

They had a touch of paradise
a spell you can't explain
for in this crazy paradise
you are in love with pain

Want to buy some Illusions ?
slightly used second hand ?
they were lovely illusions
reaching high, built on sand

Too bad they all fell apar
as dreams often do
they were lovely illusions
but they just wouldn't come true
