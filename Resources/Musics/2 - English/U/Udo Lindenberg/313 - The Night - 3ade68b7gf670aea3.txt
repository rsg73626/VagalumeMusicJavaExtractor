THE NIGHT

Now it's time for all good men
to climb in their pajamas -
night has come to put an end
to all the daily dramas.
But we put on our party clothes
and go into the traverns;
now it's time for all good bats
to fly out of their caverns!

There's more to do than just to sleep at night
the night has charme and mystery
a ship can't stay at anchor all the time
it's got to sail out on the bounding sea.
So here's to you, and here's to life and love
and drinks and friendships that are strong;
there's more to do than just to sleep at night -
though life is short, the night is long!

When the day is born again
in dark and dirty weather
see the birds and all the cats
congregate together.
Whispering, they forge their
conversations into bombs;
up the revolution!
Down in the catacombs!

There's more to do than just to sleep at night
the night has charme and mystery
a ship can't stay at anchor all the time
it's got to sail out on the bounding sea.
So here's to you, and here's to life and love
and drinks and friendships that are strong;
there's more to do than just to sleep at night -
though life is short, the night is long!
