I'D LIKE TO BE A CHILD AGAIN

Sometimes I wish I'd have a time-machine 
I would press the button and I'd be a child again 
in my little northern hometown 
where the good old seawind blew 
where we played our games in the yellow sand 
where we always had a lot of important things to do 
where we thought this kind of life would never end 

There was so much going on 
and the world was full of sensations 
and ev'ry single day had a hundred fantastic situations 
riding on a sunbeam, running through the rain 
I'd like to be a child again 

I close my eyes - I see pictures of memory 
I was playin' in a garden 
where the flowers were even taller than me 
where I met that little boy - my first love 
he said he would be a superstar 
we were so sure that we would marry 
but then he changed his mind 
and he felt in love with racing-cars 

There was so much going on 
and the world was full of sensations 
and ev'ry single day had a hundred fantastic situations 
riding on a sunbeam, running through the rain 
I'd like to be a child again
