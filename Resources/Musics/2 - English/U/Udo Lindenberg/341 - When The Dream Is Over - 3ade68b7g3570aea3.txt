WHEN THE DREAM IS OVER

It's like wakin' up in the morning 
when you feel you've had a good dream 
but you can't quite remember what is was 
it`s like wakin' up in the morning 
when the dream's just left a shadow 
and you feel like a lost man 
who left his intended train too early 
and at the wrong station 

When the dream is over 
you can try as hard as you can 
you can only keep some sweet thoughts 
but you can never ever get back to that dream again
