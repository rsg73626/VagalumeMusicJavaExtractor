CHATTANOOGA CHOO CHOO

Pardon me, boy, Is this the Chattanooga choo choo? 
Track twenty-nine 
Boy, you can give me a shine 
I can afford 
To board a Chattanooga choo choo 
I've got my fare 
And just a trifle to spare 

You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four 
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore 
Dinner in the diner 
Nothing could be finer 
Than to have your ham an' eggs in Carolina 

When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar 
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far 
Shovel all the coal in 
Gotta keep a-rollin' 
Woo, woo, Chattanooga there you are 

There's gonna be 
A certain party at the station 
Satin and lace 
I used to call funny face 
She's gonna cry 
Until I tell her that I'll never roam 
So Chattanooga choo choo 
Won't you choo-choo me home 
Chattanooga choo choo 
Won't you choo-choo me home
