I DON'T KNOW WHO I SHOULD BELONG TO

I don't know who I should belong to
I think that it's wrong to have just one romance;
if I told you I loved you only
someone would be lonely, and not have a chance.

Should something so fine be just one person's treasure?
The sun and the stars are for everyone's pleasure.
I don't know who I should belong to
I want to belong to nobody - but me.

No - one has a claim on the moon above me
you'll just have to share, 'cause there's only one of me -
I want to belong to nobody - but me.
