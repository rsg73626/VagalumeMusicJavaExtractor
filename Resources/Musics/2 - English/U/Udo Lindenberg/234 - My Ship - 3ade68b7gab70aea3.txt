MY SHIP

My ship has sails that are made of silk, 
the decks are trimmed with gold, 
and of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold. 

My ship's a glow with a million pearls 
and rubies fill each bin, 
the sun sits high in a sapphire sky 
when my ship comes in. 

I can wait the years 
til it appears 
one fine day, one spring, 
but the pearls an such 
they won't mean much, 
If there's missing just one thing. 

Do not care if that day arrives 
that dream need never be, 
If the ship I sing 
doesn't also bring 
my own true love to me. 

If the ship I sing 
doesn't also bring 
my own true love to me.
