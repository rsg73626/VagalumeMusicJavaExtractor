PARADISE NOW

The time is now for takin' a look at the rising earth 
above the moons horizon - rising earth 
we are all one - one world or no world 

Look around and see what's wrong 
we have to start to make it better 
we can't just let the things go on 
look, people have to come together 
come together, come together 
look, people have to come together 

World is a rainbow - colorful living forever 
you can do what you want 
and we do it all together 
we wait no longer - mankind's a big family 
we're gettin' ready for makin' a chain 
around the world hand in hand 
paradise now 
we're gettin' ready my friend 
for makin' a chain around the world hand in hand 
paradise now 
the world is a rainbow - colorful living forever 
paradise now 
you can do what you want and we do it all together 
paradise now
