WHAT COLOR HAS THE SOUL

USA - South Africa 
there's no need to go so far 
look around just where you are 
see the people standing there, going back 
they've got the past in their heads 
they ignore the tragedy all around 
'cause the see only what they see 

They see the color of your skin, my friend 
and that's enough for them to lift up their hand 
they still don't know that only fairness leads to peace 
what can we do to set them free from prejudice 

What is the color of your soul 
what is the color of your heart 
what harmony fits your mentality 
the man who's assessin' you with your complexion in his view 
and not your characteris ... let me see a color too 
is like the dirty past, so cruel, so dark is he 
whatever can he be? 

What color has the soul 
what color has the conscience 
what color has humanity 
see no colors just see the worth of a man's personality 

Mozambique - Rhodesia 
I can count a hundred lands 
first look around, see where you are 
see some forward-looking people, straight ahead 
they've got good will in their hearts 
they recognize the urgency of the change 
see, what humanity requires from you and me 

They say the world is a rainbow, my friend 
let's make a chain around the world hand in hand 
they realize that life is full of possibilities 
to change the things and make the world a place of love and peace 

What color has the soul 
what color has the conscience 
what color has humanity 
see no colors - see the worth of a man's personality
