FATHER YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED HITLER

My father lived in Germany before the war in 1933
He was a violinist in Berlin's most popular cabaret
"You watched the tide turn dirty brown
weren't you afraid you were gonna drown
in your orchestrapit
while sailorgirls sang through the night
those silly lovesongs in the limelight
how could you stand it?"

Bert Brecht already left the land
from cabarets so many had been banned
the first had been killed by the crowd
you couldn't hear the music was too loud
you should have sold your violin
or traded it in for a gun
rather than fiddling the refrain
doing cocaine and charming ev'ryone

You should have killed Hitler
you know you would have been right
why didn't you fight?
You should have killed Hitler
you didn't see behind the curtain
you didn't try to stop that show
was it so nice your Third-Reich-paradise
where the sailorgirls sang: Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
tralala, wunderbar
no panic on the Titanic

hey dad, you didn't see behind the curtain
you didn't try to stop that show
was it so nice your Third-Reich-paradise
where the sailorgirls sang:
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
tralala, wunderbar
no panic on the Titanic
feel alright - what a night
no panic on the Titanic
more champagne - more cocaine
no panic on the Titanic
what a night - out of sight
no panic on the Titanic
tralala, wunderbar
no panic...
