WHEN THE SUN SETS

I've learned about life, at it's lowest and highest 
I've lived and I've loved and I've had a good time 
but now when I look at things clear and unbiased 
there's no use in laughing, and no use in crying. 

I've learned about life, from the top to the bottom 
from all kinds of people I've met on my way 
but now spring is gone - with the coming of autumn 
I keep my emotions locked safely away. 
But sometimes... 

When the sun sets over the rooftops of town 
my memories and I are alone 
when the night falls and there is no - one around 
then the shadows come in on their own - 
they stand and they stare like the guardians of fate 
and all I can do is sit quit and wait 
'til the daylight chases darkness away. 
When the sun sets over the rooftops of town 
my memories and I are alone. 

I know about love from the north to the south 
sometimes I've won the game, an sometimes I've lost 
I've heard bizarre wishes from feverish mouths 
I know about happiness, and what it costs. 
I've tasted sweet love in the east and the west 
from mornings in Paris to nights in Ceylon 
and one of the things that I think I know best 
is that love is here one day, the next day it's gone. 
But sometimes... 

When the sun sets over the rooftops of town 
my memories and I are alone.
