WANDAFURU WAARUDO

Don' t know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science books
Don't know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this could be

Dono machi made ikeba     kimi ni aeru darou
Dono machi o arukeba     kimi ni aeru darou

#Oshiete okure yo     kimi ga suki dakara
    Itsumo soba ni itai kara

Nanimo shiranai kedo     warai tobashite
Kimi no koto dake     kangaeteru
Mou sugu iku kara ne

Muzukashii koto nanka
Yoku wakaranai kedo
Koi sureba daredemo
Boku to onaji na no sa dakara
