A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE

I got a little something
That I'd like to share with you yeah
It's a little bit dark
A little bit cold and it's hard to bear

Togwa mumatigga (Do not fall into temptation)
Otuke okwejjusa nga bwayita (And get to regret, when it's too late)
Tokemebwa wama (Do not be tempted)
Fuba nyo okwewala (Try hard to avoid)

If we could see
Past the pleasures of life
Then maybe we'd know
The real meaning of life

Chorus 2x
A little bit of love

And a little bit of hope
A little bit of caution is all we need
A little bit wiser
A little bit smarter
Your heart's been calling

Verse 2
When the heat is on
And your groove is on
When the light is green
Put your brakes on
Always be faithful
Use your protection
It will save a rainy day, yeah, yeah

Bwekuba kulinda (if it means waiting)
Naddala abaato mumyaka temupapa (especially for you the young, don't rush)
Ate mwe abafumbo mukuume obwesigwa (and you the married, stay faithful)

If we could see
Past the borders of life

Obulamu bubwo (Life is yours)
Fuba obukuume bulungi (Try to protect it well)
Bukuume (Protect it)

Chorus 2x

Verse 3
Wulira omutima gwo (Listen to your heart)
Kyegugamba wama (And what it tells you)
Osobole okukyusa embeera yo (So that you can change your behavior)

This may seem harder each day we try
But as long as we fight it we can win

 Repeat Chorus 2x
  

Bridge
Obulamu bwo bukuume (Keep your life safe)
Buno obulwadde buuta sibwa muzannyo (This disease is a killer, it's not a joke)
Tomala gagenda, wekuume (Do not just go, keep yourself safe)

Bulamu bwo bukuume (Keep your life safe)
Buno obulwadde buuta sibwa muzannyo (This disease is a killer, it's not a joke)
Tomala gagenda, wekuume (Do not just go, keep yourself safe)
Tomala gagenda (Do not just go)

Rap Verse
Yo! AIDS is real,
Something that we all can feel
United as one against the disease is the way we all can win
So join forces
Be a part of the world wide AIDS Vaccine Research team
You heard me

One time Walter Reed came to the scene
Came to fight this killing disease
Use your brain, do not take on the risk
Clear your life from the rest
If you are careless with it, you know

Twandibadde tukola namanyi (We would be working tirelessly)
Nga tetwebaka buli lunaku (Spending sleepless nights every day)
Nga twetala (Moving here and there)
Bulamu bwa kakyo kano (Life these days)
Bufusse bwansozi (Has become like an uphill task)
Obulamu busana magezi (Life needs wisdom)
We need to pray

If you're lonely
You get some love
You never know this world
Could get out of control
Keep on searching
And find some love
Find some love

Just a little bit
A little bit of love
Bangi bagenze

Just a little bit
Little bit of hope till fade
Just a little bit
Little bit of love till fade
