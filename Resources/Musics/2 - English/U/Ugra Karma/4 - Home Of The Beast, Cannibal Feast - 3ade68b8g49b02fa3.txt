HOME OF THE BEAST, CANNIBAL FEAST

Home Of The Beast, Cannibal Feast

Follow me, hold my hand 
Walk with me, into 213 
Feel the pain, looks so real 
Can't deny, I rule here 
Hate unleashed, you suffer 
From my wrath, eternally 
Rise so high, you cannot fly 
Eventually, you're my prey 

I cut you up, bring to pieces 
Eat your limbs, I'm satisfied 
Recepies, of human flesh 
I produce from your body 

I try out new ways to consume 
Remnants of what is left of you 

Decapitated bodies everywhere 
Horrific mass of twisted flesh 
A chilling sight of Cannibal Feast 
Jeffrey's apartment Home Of The Beast - Finest Cannibal.
