A GRAND DECLARATION OF ATHEISM & BLASPHEMY

A Grand Declaration Of Atheism & Blasphemy

Pray your almighty 
and then you shall see your heaven 
Follow the book of lies 
and lead your life sin forgiven 

I tread your holy stones 
and piss on your deity's worshipped idol 
I am the enemy of god 
and all that you say what he stands for 

Blasphemer and atheist 
I am truly a nihilist 

A mass theophilia 
A schizophrenic, cult paranoia 
Awaiting your 'saviour' 
to free yourself from earthly matter 

I have killed your god 
I am thy master, I am thy lord 
I have no fear of god 
I am here to fight till death comes 

Blasphemer and atheist 
I am truly a nihilist.
