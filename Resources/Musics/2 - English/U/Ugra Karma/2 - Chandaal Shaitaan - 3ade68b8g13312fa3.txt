CHANDAAL SHAITAAN

Chandaal Shaitaan

Chandaal Shaitan, PGA 
Chandaal Shaitan, twisted minds 
Grotesque, sick, vile acts 
Twisted words, inducing humour 

A brainstorm going through everyone's head 
Smoking, drinking, tapping, pulling our beloved 
We share our morbid thoughts gathered at the tower 
We have the rage, aggression & power 
We are what we are, our own lord 
Nihilistic thoughts embedded within us 
Chandaal Shaitan, PGA are we 
You will suffer now we're free 

We detest holy stones 
Leave your beliefs to rot alone 
We are your worst nightmare 
We'll be the ones you'll fear 

Butchery embodied in the brain 
Craving bodies for satiation 
You're lured my morbid plans 
Now you're under sadistic hands 

Oppressed thoughts explode 
Sanity Corrodes 
Asphyxiate your breath 
You pray for death 

Smashing your head 
You're still not dead yet 
You're fear motivates 
You're blood makes us salivate 

Repeatedly you're stabbed 
No screams, you're gagged 
Adrenaline's pumping hard 
Sourrounded by brutal guards 

Blood drenches - sliced incision 
Outburst of gore - Dissection 
Limbs severed - amputation 
Fondling torso - molestation 
Intestines chopped - diffusion 
Body parts left for - putrefaction 
Chandaal shaitan's - satisfaction 
False one's fatal - destruction.
