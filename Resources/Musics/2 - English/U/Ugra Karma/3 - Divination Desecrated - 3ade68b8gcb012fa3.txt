DIVINATION DESECRATED

Divination Desecrated

As I trudge through the grim place of storms 
The path where crave for blasphemy burns 
Darkness filled with blackened moonlight 
Captures and convulses my sight 

The temple's filled with witching light 
Perpetuated spellbound controlling my mind 

Blackened remain my vision 
throughout eternity 
The storms reign here devouring 
my defidency 

My lust for almighty lands arise my brutal commands 
My proselytizing strength shall ruin His kingdom 

Skies have turned blood red 
To exterminate god's realms 
Atheism shall be portrayed 
Divination desecrated 

Summoning the power of evil and crave for lust 
Thou shalt obey my commands follow my epics 
In the gruesome darkness and the creeping shadows 
Thou shalt not provoke filthy, profane spells 

Proclivator has arrived, no procrastination 
Thou shalt not dither accept the demolition 
My instinctual supremacy cannot be controlled 
Thou shalt not betray death must be adored 

Skies have turned blood red 
To exterminate god's realms 
Atheism shall be portrayed 
Divination desecrated.
