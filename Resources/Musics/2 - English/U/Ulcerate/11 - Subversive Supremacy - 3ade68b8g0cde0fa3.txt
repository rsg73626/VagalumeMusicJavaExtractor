SUBVERSIVE SUPREMACY

Belligerency against the weak
Conqueror, ascends the throne

Age of ruination
Blight of the final stronghold
Shed blood stains me
Attrition has ended
Inferiors enslaved
Degenerated empire
Behold as the beneath arise

Serving the hearts of those defeated
So we may feast upon in victory
Serving the blood of those compassionate
Raising a chalice, praising the triumphant
