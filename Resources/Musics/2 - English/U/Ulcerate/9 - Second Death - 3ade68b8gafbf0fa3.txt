SECOND DEATH

Storms of cleansing defile me
Shelter out from your wrath and fury
One's swift destruction
In final conflagration
My blood spills, my flesh boils

Marked for servitude eternally
Are those repentent unto forgery

In suffering the lesser wither in ineptness
Unsaved shall they be
In suffering I shall ascend
Angel of impiety
Saved shall none be
The earth shall burn in the bowels of my fervent abyss

Lies idolised
Implore in vain
May inhuman vengeance awaken you
Writhe in the undying flames of superiority
Spirits sacrifice
My will, my right

My redemption is in your pain
My exemption is in your death
