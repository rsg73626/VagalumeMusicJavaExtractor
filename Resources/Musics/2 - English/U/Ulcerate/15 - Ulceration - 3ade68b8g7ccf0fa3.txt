ULCERATION

Hellspawned flames caress the flesh of the untainted
The distressed pray to the lord of lacerated sight
Watching their bleeding eye sockets cry
Brethren of assassination begin rites of damnation

Screams of the enfeebled
Echo throughout rebellious lands
As they struggle against spiritual execution
Soon to fall under the rule of the strongest will

Exhausted is the sun

Exiled to languished fields
Harvested is the dying
Heretical legions kneel
Before their master
Rise the sons of banishment - assault
