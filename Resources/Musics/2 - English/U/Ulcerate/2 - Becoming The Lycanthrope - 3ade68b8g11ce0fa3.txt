BECOMING THE LYCANTHROPE

Revelation or annihilation

The futile and the fanatics
That is all we are
With scalpel incisions and flapping tongues
Bury the limbs of the hopeless

Clambering onto the funeral pyre, overwhelmed
Sacrifice and sedition
Let the ashes of our cancer rise
To be inhaled by the congregation

Carry your doctrine into the flames
Or swallow it whole and exit the wake

As the smoke blackens the horizon
Revel in your decision (delusion)
As the inferno turns to embers
Breathe in the essence of despair

Piss on the ash and the bones of the dead
Laugh and rejoice as the black turns blood red

But your carnivorous smile betrays
Revealing the teeth that will devour us all

A grin to mark the end of days
