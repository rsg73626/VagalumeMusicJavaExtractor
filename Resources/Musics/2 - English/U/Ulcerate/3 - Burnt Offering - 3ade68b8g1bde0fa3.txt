BURNT OFFERING

Your disciples of falsehood
In constraint benighted baptism
Charred wings disintegrate
Drowning in the tears of those forsaken
Angels are cast into rivers of blood
Bathing
Flowing through the kingdom of the nefarious
Bleeding

Eternal punishment
For sin is what I am
Odium absorbed
Bring forth my enemies

Stigmatised father
Divine I must be
Stigmatised father
Divine I become

Ill omened demonic martyr
Unwanting heaven as I run to the forbidden

Immolation of the seraphim
