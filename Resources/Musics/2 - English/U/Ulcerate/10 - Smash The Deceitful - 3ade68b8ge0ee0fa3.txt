SMASH THE DECEITFUL

Predator of the self righteous onslaught upon
Those who wished for peace gain hardship
Enduring as strength intensifies
Hatred empowers, I worship

Despair alight
The funeral internal

Desolation dominates
As I fall away
Envenomed - rule by my blood

Death shall prove superior than life
Heavens destroyed in holocaust

No god
No love
No hope

Smash the deceitful
