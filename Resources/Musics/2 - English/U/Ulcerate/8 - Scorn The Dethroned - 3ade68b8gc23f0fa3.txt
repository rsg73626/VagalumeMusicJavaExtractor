SCORN THE DETHRONED

Your tears of misery fill this chalice from which I drink
Disdainful as I witness your reality induced decay

Lost souls have no will of their own
The diseased beg for destruction
Beg for absolution
Bestowed light of dilution
Shackles of slavery embraced

Fuck your god - banish hypocrisy
Fuck your god - eternal enemy

A decrepit empyrean
Prepares the graves of millions oppressed
Ageless, unburied
The one who doubted his empire

Praise this primal entity
Sworn to dark sovereignty
Summon it's strength, it's wisdom
Only I can destroy me
