MYSTERY LIGHTS

Billions of people, they have their reasons
No destination, just a slave to this prefect
They turn their back on you

And if everyone would just join hands,
I'll tell you something you would not believe
I see the signs, seen the writings on the wall
And baby I'm scared

All good people will try and fight
But what they don't know will kill them

Turn around please

Come down, systems, collide
Say are you alone?
Hide here, tonight
Starry skies shine the light
Go back, run fast
You've come too late, there's nothing left
Can you, hear us, go fast
Send out a warning

No one will answer, we try to obey
So will you lead us in the right direction
We could be saved by you

We've been misguided by a shady plan
It's the demise of the modern man
Tell everybody that you've seen firsthand
And nature, she'll take her course.

All good people will try and fight
But what they don't know will kill us all.

Turn Around Please

CHORUS
