DANCE WITH ME

I love it how I walk away
I won't feel at all
Don't tell me what to say
There's no need to tell
Don't wanna hear your intellect
Just don't think at all

Cause all your rules are meaningless
Just don't fall
Don't fall for me

All this past is killing me
There's no end in sight
If I could just get rid of it
I will try
I will try
Don't wanna psychoanalyze
I'm just not the type

Cause all these rules are meaningless
I just won't fall
Won't fall for it

Lie down
Sit (skid) it up
Dance with me
Lie down
Pull it away
In to me

Don't stop
Just let it go
Come with me
Stay down
Cause you're grilling me up
Dance with me

Lie down
Sit it up
Dance with me
Lie down
Pull it away
In to me

Don't stop
Just let it go
Come with me
Stay down
Cause you're grilling me up
Dance with me
