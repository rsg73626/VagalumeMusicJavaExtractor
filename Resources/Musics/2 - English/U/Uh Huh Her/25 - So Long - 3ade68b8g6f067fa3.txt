SO LONG

All I hear your stupid lines
So be firm your sorrow life
24 hours is not enough time
To make me feel alright 
(oh yeah)

It's not enough time 
(oh yeah)

You Know wanna hurt
You keep those lies inside your head
They'll come out sooner or later
Don't think that you've been so mislead
You keep them buried forever (hey oh)

You know you want out 
(oh yeah)
I know you want out

See it all comes down to a different fear
It all comes around again
You see we loose ourselves when there's nothing real
So long, so long, so long

You wanna push it all away
It sneaks up sooner or later
You like to look like you behave
Why don't you stop your pretending? 
(hey)

You know you want out 
(oh hey)
I know you want out

See it all comes down to a different fear
See it all comes around again
You see we loose ourselves when there's nothing real
So long, so long, so long

See it all comes down to a different fear
See it all comes around again
You see we loose ourselves when there's nothing real
So long, so long, so long
