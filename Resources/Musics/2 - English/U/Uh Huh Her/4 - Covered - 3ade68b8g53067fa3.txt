COVERED

Would I fall into that spell again?
I don't think so anymore
But I don't know what's written

I'll be there anyway
Call it love I guess
Hotter than the sun
You can appreciate that

I'll say hey whatcha know
I don't know how you let it go
Say hey whatcha know
Wish you knew what I was thinking
Hey watch me now
I know how to level your head
Whatcha gonna say?
Whatcha gonna say?

Holler when you want it
Gonna sing sing
"How do you love again?"
You're higher than the sun
But you're covered with my hands tonight

Oh Baby
Holler when you want it
Gonna sing sing "How do you love again?"
You're covered by the dark night
But you're covered with hands tonight

Oh see all the things that surround you
Are full of love
Brighter than the stars
So why are those cold dark hours?

I'll say "Hey watch you now"
I don't know how to let it go
Hold, hold
Should let you talk
But I don't know what you've been thinking
"Hey watch you now"
I guess I don't know what went wrong
See you again my lovely
You say "Forever can't touch you
'cause it's harder (hotter) than hell"

Holler when you want it
Gonna sing sing (say say)
"How do you love again?"
You're higher than the stars
But you're covered with my hands tonight

Holler when you want it
Gonna sing sing "How do you love again?"
You're covered by the dark night
But you're covered with my hands tonight

(break)

Holler when you want it gone
Gonna sing sing "How do you love again?"
You're covered by the dark of the night
But you're covered with my hands tonight oh baby
