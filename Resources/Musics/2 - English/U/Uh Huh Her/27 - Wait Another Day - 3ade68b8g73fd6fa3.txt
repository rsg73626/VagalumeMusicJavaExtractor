WAIT ANOTHER DAY

I look at the starlight
I am shattered by the night
Always run where I can
And I hide where I wanna hide
But it feels so right
I want it tonight
It feels so right, oh

I went out of my mind
I'm calling one more time
I know how it feels tonight
I can do nothing right
But it feels so right
I want it tonight
You feel so right

Oh, I will wait to love you
I will wait another day
For you I'd leave all this behind
I will wait for you tonight
I will waste another dream on you
Always run to you alone

I will take the long road
But it leads right back to you
If only you'll do the same
I will still stand for you
But it feels so right
I want it tonight
You feel so right

Oh, I will wait to love you
I will wait another day
For you I'd leave all this behind
I will wait for you tonight
I will waste another dream on you
Always run to you

I will wait to love you
I will wait another day
For you I'd leave all this behind
I will wait for you tonight
I will waste another dream on you
Always run to you
