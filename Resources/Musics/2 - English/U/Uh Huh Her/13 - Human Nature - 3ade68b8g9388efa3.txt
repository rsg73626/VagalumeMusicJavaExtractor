HUMAN NATURE

Your world is changed and over your head going crazy
And all the things that you realized you said had taken toll
You stay the same but you look up ahead there something out there
This love is curse but really is worse without it planned

Is seems like human nature
The way you stand up
Do you want to make love
Staring at the sea
And everything between as you watch the world fall

I think your name and you showed up to save me
This is crazy
At times when steep and I look in your eyes
They are cold
You look so tough but at times you are wrong to not be scared of
Made up my mind of this something you hide
Weâ€™ll all stay with you

Is seems like human nature
The way you stand up
Do you want to make love
Staring at the sea
And everything between as you watch the world fall
