NOT A LOVE SONG

The scene is stood by morning slipping past the great divide
It chases over bridges spins me out of my own mind
I will drag you back in, what you see is what you get
Oh say you love me again, but you never do

So I am singing a love, singing a love song
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I wanna fall away and waste another day
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

I see I dissappoint you, why don't you find another friend
I seem to let you fall now
If you fall, won't you tell me in writing
But you, you waste no time, do you?
But you can't waste mine
Oh say you love me again, but you never do... yeah

So I am singing a love, singing a love song
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I wanna fall away and waste another day
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

But if you can't save love anyway, you'll love again
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I wanna fall away and waste another day
'Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
