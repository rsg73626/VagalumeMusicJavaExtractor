NO SACRIFICE

Don't sacrifice what isn't there
My heart is breaking
You seem to think I am amused by you
You're neither here and you're neither there
My mind is made up
I'm falling down but I pick myself up

And I scream out loud at the top of my lungs"
How I love the ride, oh I saw so many places
And I scream my name at the top of your lungs
But I'm done now, I'm broken by this

I wish you'd come out of your hiding
Time you wake up
And made me finish what you started
Oh you come crawling but it's the right time
And now I'm fading
You never give yourself to this

And I scream out loud, oh at the top of our lungs
How I love the ride, oh I saw so many places
And we scream my name, oh at the top of our lungs
But I'm done here, we're broken by this
