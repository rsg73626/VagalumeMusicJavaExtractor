MARSTORM

I gather nothing’s going my way
You can’t appreciate the irony
You build me up, you break me down

Too bad your empire is falling
Don’t take us down while you’re sinking
The battle’s on, it just begun

This fight it kills us in a free fall
You take the innocence from people
I am compelled to go alone, now

Your breed, I’ve seen it with my own eyes
Now you made me your enemy
The battle’s on, get out your guns

Give me some love
Maybe you’ll see that this is not enough
You will see us in the place beyond
You can come if you want to
Come if you want to love something
You can come if you want to
Come if you want to

You are so careless with your kingdom
You always throw away the great ones
But you told me I’m the one

I just need someone to believe in
You cannot rule with integrity
You break my heart, you break my heart

Give me some love
Maybe you’ll see that this is not enough
You will see us in the place beyond
You can come if you want to
Come if you want to love something
You can come if you want to
Come if you want to

Give me some love
What are you scared of, holding on to me?
What are you scared of, holding on to me?
What are you scared of?
