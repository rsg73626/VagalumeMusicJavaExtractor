SAME HIGH

As you shed a force come to keep me warm
Oh I cannot speak
The silence turns me on
Oh my eyes were closed
Afraid to think I'm wrong
But the weakest hearts swallow in restraint

We're on the same high
It's a stereo
It's the same song
We're on the same high
So we'll carry on
It's the same song
We're on the same high
We're on common ground
It's the same song
We're on the same high
It'll carry on
It's the same song

And the sweet reward dominates the pain
As each breath we take suffers just the same
Lost inside the void and I'll be in someone
And all I'll do to feel the same as I did

It took you so long to see its beautiful
So long to see
We're on the same high

We're on the same high
It's a stereo
It's the same song
We're on the same high
So we'll carry on
It's the same song
We're on the same high
We're on common ground
It's the same song
We're on the same high
It'll carry on
It's the same song

Yee-ah, yeah, yeah
Yee-ah, yeah, yeah
Yee-eah, (high)
Yee-ah, (high)
Yeah yeah
