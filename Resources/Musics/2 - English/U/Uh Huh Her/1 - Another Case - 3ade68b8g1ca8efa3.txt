ANOTHER CASE

I’m better than the other one
You’re a harder chase
You’re fast against mine

I’ll beat it, you’re the weaker one
That’s another case
I’ll taste the last line

I will take you to the other side
I will set you up
You’re fast against mine

I will tear you from the other one
It’s a bitter race
You’re frail

I am stronger than the other ones
I will set them off
Don’t try to fight me

I will break you either way it seems
It’s a testimony, to how this will end

I’ll stop it when I’ve finally won
I’ll take you down somehow
I will stay ‘till I’m the only one
That’s another case
You failed

And you feel you’ve lost it
And you know you've lost it

Tell me I’m the only one
Though it’s not the same
You’re fast against mine

Tell me I’m the only one
It’s a better place
You’re mine completely

Tell me I’m the only one
You give me hope somehow
Tell me I’m the only one
That’s another case
You feel so empty

Tell me I'm the only one,
The only one

Tell me I'm the only one,
The only one

Tell me I'm the only one,
The only one

Tell me I'm the only one,
The only one

Tell me I'm the only one,
The only one
