PHILOSOPHY

I'm sitting here along the west side
I think of all the ways that
I could fuck with you right now
But when I wrap my head around you
You coundn't be more trouble and
I don't nees to lift a finger

Jump in a hole,
I dig it for you
You're in a hole,
I dig it for you

You live inside the space between life
Your crazy world is so small
When you think about it
You can take your shit out on me
Look in the mirror
Then you see what I see

Jump in your hole,
I dig it for you
Jump in the hole

I'll tell you my philosophy
Is new reality
I have gone to hell and back
We suffered through enough
Don't tell me your religion
The price to pay is freedom
I have gone to hell and back
Your ship was always sinking

You like to have your way to know it
What's love got to do when you think about it?
Say it's time to stop pretending
Things, they come and they go
That's the way it is
You like your living it's just beginning
I'm not the one to blame, I'm not the one

Jump in your hole
I dig it for you
Jump in the hole
I dig it for you

I'll tell you my philosophy
Is new reality
I have gone to hell and back
We suffered through enough
Don't tell me your religion
The price to pay is freedom
I have gone to hell and back
Your ship was always sinking

You scream it out from the mountaintops
You throw us all, for what?
Your actions, they speak louder than words
Was it enough to drag us all down into your world?

Jump in your hole
I dig it for you
Jump in the hole
I dig it for you

I'll tell you my philosophy
Is new reality
I have gone to hell and back
We suffered through enough
Don't tell me your religion
The price to pay is freedom
I have gone to hell and back
Your ship was always sinking
