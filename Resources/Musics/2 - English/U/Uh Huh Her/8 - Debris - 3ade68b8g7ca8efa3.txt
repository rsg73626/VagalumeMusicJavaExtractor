DEBRIS

Now I’ve said too much
Panting on this couch
Skin is burning off
Hand inside my top,
Tell me not to stop
This will leave a scar
Fingers falling hard

I’m a kitten on a wire
Crazy little liar
Hate myself
Taste myself
Hush, hush

Nothing’s what it seems
When you talk you make me cream
Took the chance away from me
I am restless on the phone, phone
Nothing’s what it seems
Nothing but debris
I will take you in my dreams
