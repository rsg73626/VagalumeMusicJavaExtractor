DREAMER

You've seen the worst of me now
I'm all alone see
You've lost me somehow
And what weÂ’re fighting for is peace
Are you still in love with me 
or someone else?

Well I'm such a dreamer
Put yourself in my shoes
careful with what you wish for love

I've seen the worst of You too
I let it go see
Because i have to

Oh when I'm falling on my knees
You'll take my hand and yours 
And we will be, we'll be

'Cause I'm such a dreamer
Put yourself in my shoes
careful with what you wish for life

WhatÂ’s the matter with our ways?
I´m missing something not to blame
but don´t you worry this will pass
it's only 'cause my mind gone steady
You could try i've lost my head
All of this is just begining
Not enough never enough
I only want to keep on dreaming

'cause I'm such a dreamer
Put yourself in my shoes
careful with what you wish for life
