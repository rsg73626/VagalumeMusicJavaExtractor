COMMON REACTION

Hey love
Your face is full of lies
Be careful what you ask
Because just how you act

You're tired
Tired of the dark
Oh you covered in dust
Yeah you covered in dust

You don't feel like
(Can you feel when you wounded like that dear)
Don't feel right
(Don't mind it's a common reaction)
Take me higher
(And they tell me everything is alright)
And you don't mind
(And you don't mind)
BOTH- Don't waste my time

You don't feel like
(Can you feel when you wounded like that dear)
Don't feel right
(Don't mind it's a common reaction)
Take me higher
(And they tell me everything is alright)
And you don't mind
(And you don't mind)
BOTH- Don't waste my time

Do you realize
We're caught in the middle of your alibi?
You've been living in a dream
And you think we'll unlikely fall

I'll sell you why
Based on the fact that you were always lying
Oh you covered in dust
Yeah you're covered in dust

You don't feel like
(Can you feel when you wounded like that dear)
Don't feel right
(Don't mind it's a common reaction)
Take me higher
(And they tell me everything is alright)
And you don't mind
(And you don't mind)
BOTH- Don't waste my time

You don't feel like

Don't feel right
(Don't mind it's a common reaction)
Take me higher
(And they tell me everything is alright)
And you don't mind
(And you don't mind)
BOTH- Don't waste my time

I don't like quiet in the rain
With you
I don't like quiet
You wait for fire
Against the wall

I don't like quiet in the rain
With you
I don't like quiet
You wait for fire
Against the wall

You don't feel like
(Can you feel when you wounded like that dear)
Don't feel right
