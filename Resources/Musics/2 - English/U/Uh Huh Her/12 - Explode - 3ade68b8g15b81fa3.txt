EXPLODE

I wanna explode
watch me
Im a lucky girl
see I
I like you
So wont you pay if you wanna go down 

I love to watch you, honey
You need me, so lets see
What do you care, if you want to
just pay if you wanna go 

Don't walk away
Don’t walk away love
Don’t’ walk away
Don’t walk away love 

I wanna touch you, slowly
I'm a lonely girl
Come on
You want to
So won't you pay if you wanna go down 

I’d love to hurt you
Easy
I've got you, inside me
What do you care if you want to 
You should pay if you wanna go down, or


Don’t Walk away
Don’t walk away love
Don’t’ walk away
Just stay right here

Why don’t you pay if you wanna go
You got to pay if you want some more (2x)
