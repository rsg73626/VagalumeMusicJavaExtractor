AWAY FROM HERE

What if I could change the world 
one day at a time?
I'd go back and stay
Too much is gone to even try
Shallow in depth
So I can see everything so clearly
I would take it back again
I'd take it bland
Take you back

You say I don't
want to learn
Won't you come and take me
Away, away from here

You say I won't
Oh my, won't you
come and take me away
Away from here

Well this is a reversal
Everyone is hurt here
Fell from you so high
Beat me like a drum
Now you finally have won
I'm wounded again

I say 
what if I could change your world 
one day at a time?
Well I'd be waiting for someone to change my mind
Change my mind

You say oh wait
Oh love won't you come and take me away
Away from here

You stay away
Oh my won't you come and take me away
Away from here

What if I could change your world one day at a time?
