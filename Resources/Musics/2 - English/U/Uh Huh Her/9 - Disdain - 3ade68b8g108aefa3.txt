DISDAIN

Oh love, what did you do to my heart?
Cause it stains
And I would love to let it go

Oh you, you make it look so sweet
It hurts
And I am not the same

Oh I can't escape anymore
I have to let it go
Oh I can't do this anymore
Just have to let you go

I wanna break free
Walk under a blue sky
Oh give me what I need
Cause I'll go sooner or later

Oh love, look at my bleeding heart
Cause it stains
And we're not the same

Never fall out of line
Oh you won't let it lie
Cause there's a war going on in your head
And it's winning so far
Please don't leave me alone
I know we're not the same, we're not the same
Disdain, Disdain
