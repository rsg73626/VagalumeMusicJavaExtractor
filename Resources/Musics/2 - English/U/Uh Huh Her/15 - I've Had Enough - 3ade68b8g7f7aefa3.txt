I'VE HAD ENOUGH

I’ve lost myself again
But if I could show you places I have been
Anyway I’ve had enough
I say goodbye to you and to

...everyone

Chorus

‘Cause I’ve had enough
I’d take you away

Today I can’t see much
But I got myself from fall because I’ve lost your love
But if I could breathe again
I’d take out what you gave me in

I’d take out that you gave me in

I’d take you away
I’d take you away
