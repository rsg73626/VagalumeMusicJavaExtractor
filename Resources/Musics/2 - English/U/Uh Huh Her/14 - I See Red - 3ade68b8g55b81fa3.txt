I SEE RED

You seem like you’re impossible now
You want love, you want me to show you how
It feels like it’s all possible now
You need love, and I’m gonna show you how

You say that, I’m stupid 
Without you I’m useless
I’m bothered, you don’t even notice

So how bout, you reach up
You realize, you see it
Come on, you really love this

You cry out loud when you’re reckless in the dark
You like the way it feels good
You love the way I make you forget
You turn me on, whenever you’re around
You like the way you feel it
I love the way I make you forget

You seem like you’re unstoppable now
You take love, and keep it all somehow
It feels like all I need is your help
I’m fading, alone all by myself

You say that, I’m stupid 
Without you I’m useless
I’m bothered, you don’t even notice

You cry out loud when you’re reckless in the dark
You like the way it feels good
You love the way I make you forget
You turn me on, whenever you’re around
You like the way you feel it
I love the way I make you forget

You stay, I’ll stay, we’ll be alone
