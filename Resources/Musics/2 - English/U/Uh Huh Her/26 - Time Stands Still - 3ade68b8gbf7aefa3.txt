TIME STANDS STILL

I can't believe I can't let it go
The difference you make, it completely changed me
And I can't believe I haven't let you know
But today it's gonna change
You re-arranged me

Cause time stands still now
And we're the last ones
Cause everybody's changing
And we're remaining

I can't believe I haven't told you so
I see your face in everything that shines
I can't believe you were so blind to see
What a difference it makes to turn back the tables
