MANY COLORS

My destination, I'll give it all I got
This realization is long overdue
I'm fascinated with the way you move
Your many colors could light up the room

You bring the light of love
Cause fate leads the way
When my eyes are closed I think of you
Cause fate leads the way

Can't see the future, don't know what she'll bring
I'll sit here waiting one day at a time
It's complicated, don't know what it means
I hope the stars will still be aligned
