DARKNESS IS

Darkness is never absolute tears
Unlike wars without fear
You're running like you're oh so shy
Feels like there's more to life than this
I don't like anything I see
I don't, I don't like nothing at all

Cease like rain, I didn't know what to do
You were the same old shame
You're running like you're oh so shy
I didn't see you come
I didn't know what to do
But I will fix you up
I don't like nothing at all

Kill the pain, I don't even know what to do
You're running from the same old things
And nobody looks the same
Don't make me feel this way
I feel no pain
But I feel like falling down again, down again
I do

I say to the world to leave it alone
And say hell to the ones who sit on their thrones
And tell everybody to gather their guns and fear
What?
Do you really want to let them control you?

And damn to the hands who leave you alone
So long as they can't get a taste of what love is
Say what you can, and mean what you say
It always wins
All I'm really trying to do is tell you love

Do you want to let them control you?
Say I don't know what you're thinking
Do you really want to let them control you?
You win some
Everybody's losing
Don't mind, no matter what you're choosing
Do you really want to let them control you?
