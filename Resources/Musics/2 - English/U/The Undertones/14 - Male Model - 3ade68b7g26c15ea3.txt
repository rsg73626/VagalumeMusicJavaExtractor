MALE MODEL

When I was young I never wanted toys
Things like that were for little boys
My mamma got me clothes for her favourite son
Freeman's item A page 61

I wanna wanna be a male model
I wanna wanna be a male model
I wanna wanna be a ... model ... model

Read women's magazines for fashion scenes
Til you know the prices they're in pounds and pence
Reminds me that I can't afford to buy new clothes
I never got a chance to say I'll take those

I wanna wanna be ...

I'm fed up of wearing things second hand
The coat that must belong to another man
Sizes that got out of style years ago
Anything cheap I don't wanna know
