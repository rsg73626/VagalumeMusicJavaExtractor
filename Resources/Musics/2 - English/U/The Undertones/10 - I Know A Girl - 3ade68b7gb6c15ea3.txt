I KNOW A GIRL

I know a girl
I know that she knows about me
She not just a girl
I think she knows how I feel

I know a girl
I know a girl

I know a girl
I know that see her all the time in the street
She makes me feel
I'm in love every time that we meet
I know a girl
I know a girl

I know a girl
See her everyday of the week
She makes me feel
I'm in love every time that we meet
I know a girl
I know a girl
