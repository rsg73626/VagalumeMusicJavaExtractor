TRUE CONFESSIONS

Don't look so surprised
You've been telling me lies
True - true - true - confessions

Its hard to wake up to your makeup
So let's take off that disguise
True - true - true - confessions

Let's sit down and sort this out
Its not so hard to talk about
True - true - true - confessions

I got a picture from your sister
There was writing on the back
True - true - true - confessions
