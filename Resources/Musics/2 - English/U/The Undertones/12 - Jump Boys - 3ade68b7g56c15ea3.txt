JUMP BOYS

Jump boys - Jump boys - Jump boys - Jump boys

Jump boys are crazy they don't have no sense
Never getting lost in coincidence
Never lost for words they always shoot from the moon
To make it with the girls who can't come to their rooms

Jump boys ...

To be slick to be sorry got more energy than most
Night time's the long time they prowl just like ghosts
Spit at your face never trying to walk away
Get into trouble they've got a lot to say

Jump boys
