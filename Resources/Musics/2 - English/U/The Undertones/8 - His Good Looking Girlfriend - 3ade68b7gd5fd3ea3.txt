HIS GOOD LOOKING GIRLFRIEND

He's never been more popular since he met Marie 
He never went to parties and he's drinking wine for free 
He says he doesn't know why he never stays at home 

Doesn't he know ? 
Doesn't he know ? 
Everybody wants to know his good looking girlfriend 
Everybody wants to know his good looking girlfriend 

He's trying hard to act the part but it never works 
They always see through him to her and she's the one that hurts 
She hates all his friends and wonders why they're always near 

Doesn't she know ? 
Doesn't she know ? 

Everybody ... 

He loves Marie and he's happy at last 
Happy to forget his unhappy past 

He thinks he's got all those friends but really he's got none 

Doesn't he know ... 
Everybody wants ...
