FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT

so you think you're so clever, never in doubt,
but i've seen you two together, fooling about,
don't get me wrong now, i've seen what you are,
mummy wouldn't like it, it's gone too far,

Got to - keep it in the family
Learn to - keep it in the family
Have to - keep it in the family
Want to - keep it in the family

Playing with each other, its your favourite game,
You never try to hide it, there's no shame,
You'll soon be discovered, what will you do then,
Family entertainment, will come to an end,

Got to - keep it in the family
Learn to - keep it in the family
Have to - keep it in the family
Want to - keep it in the family
