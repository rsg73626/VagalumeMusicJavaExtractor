I GOTTA GETTA

Jackie Trainer says that she's never at home
Cos when she's in she knows she's never alone
They'd always be somebody whose just hanging around
Waiting for a chance to start putting her down

Next time we'll have to better
I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta

Little Jamie hides in the front of the car
He'll never learn to drive he knows its too late now
He turns ignition on and its ready to start
As the car begins to move he feels it falling apart.

Next time
