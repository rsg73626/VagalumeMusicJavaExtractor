BILLY'S THIRD

If you say no 
it would break my heart in two
But don't you realise
There's too many watching you

We're making too many problems
Making matters worse
Maybe its a curse
But oh baby its hurts
But oh baby its hurts

Don't look down cos if you do
you won't see what's in front of you
Can't turn your back on me this time
Cos if you do I won't mind

We're making ...

If you say no 
If you say no 

We're making....
