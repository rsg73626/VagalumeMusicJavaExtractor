GIRLS DON'T LIKE IT

Yeah I don't go for him do you ? 

Here comes Eddie in a brand new car
Driving like that he won't get far
Kissing in the back seat all the way home
You can't do that if you're on your own
But what else can you do if the girls don't like it

Says he doesn't have nowhere else to go
No late night movies now on radio
Just a TV switched up really loud
Know what I mean it becomes part of the crowd
But what else can you do if the girls don't like it

If the girls want to know what were gonna do know
Always up to things they're not supposed to allow
Leading us on telling no
Making us stop instead of letting us go
But what else can you do if the girls don't like it
