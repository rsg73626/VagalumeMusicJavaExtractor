LISTENIN' IN

I was sitting on my own
No one rang so I picked up the phone
Then I heard your voice
I was listening in

You were talking in the hall
I wasn't there but I heard it all
Nothing I could do
Just listening in

On the carpet you're so small
Who had you covered wall to wall
Nothing I could do
Just listening in

Now you're gone any your line's dead
Nothing I can do instead
No more - no more
No more listening in
