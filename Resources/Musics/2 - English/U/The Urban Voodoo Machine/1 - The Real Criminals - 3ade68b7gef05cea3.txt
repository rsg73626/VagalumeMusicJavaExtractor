THE REAL CRIMINALS

Poverty breeds violence
And violence breeds revenge
When hope goes out the window
And your troubles don’t seem to end
You know the Devil’s got work for idle hands
You can get yourself a job
You got nothing left to lose now
They’ve taken all you got

Oh oh who are the real criminals?
They have taken your soul
Who are the real criminals ?

History is written by the winners
And you know that it’s a lie
All those promises 
Came from a Judas in discuise
So here we go again 
Another conspiracy
One man’s wealth 
Becomes another man’s misery

So you can fight back 
Or you can lay down and cry those bitter tears
Learn to know your enemy
Learn to face your fears
They’ve corrupted your mind 
Aand you’re walking in line

They’re the real criminals
All that hope was false
