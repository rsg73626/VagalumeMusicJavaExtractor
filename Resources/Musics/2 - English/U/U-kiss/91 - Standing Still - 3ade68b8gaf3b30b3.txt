STANDING STILL

Cause i'm on fire neon ajik geu jarie

Naman mollatdeon janhokhaetdeon neoui ending
Nunchi chael su eobseotdeon neoui kerosene yeah

Cause i'm on fire but you keep on standing still
Ye i'm burning down but you keep on standing still

Kkeuchi eomneun miroe

Kkeuchi nagil gidaryeo
But you keep on standing still

While you keep on standing still

Ye i'm burning down but you keep on standing still

But you keep on standing still

While you keep on standing still

So cold when you do it to me like that
Frostbite but karma's gonna bite back
I cant believe all of the lies
Building inside now i know why

Nan bure ta nae anui nameun neoui heunjeok modu da
Burn it down majimak nunmuldo

Cause i'm on fire but you keep on standing still
Ye i'm burning down but you keep on standing still

Kkeuchi eomneun miroe
Kkeuteul irheobeorin chae
Kkeuchi nagil gidaryeo
But you keep on standing still

While you keep on standing still
