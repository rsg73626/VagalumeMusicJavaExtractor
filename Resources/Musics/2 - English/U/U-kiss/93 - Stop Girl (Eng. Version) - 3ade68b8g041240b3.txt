STOP GIRL (ENG. VERSION)

Yeah (x7)
Oh so we came a long way From the darkest night
Still I don't wanna fight you no more, I'm so tired
Oh So we came a long way And I hate to see you cry
As the days fly by
And the tears in your eyes tellin' me goodbye

Some days I don't feel like tryin
Some days I can't take the lyin'
Today's the day that I'll be flyin' away yeah

I gave you all that you needed So why do I feel defeated
And now my heart is depleted
Can't find my way eh eh

Stop girl, in the name of love
Stop girl, in the name of love Eh Eh
Stop girl in the name of love
And just like a dream I know your love isn't real

Yeah (x4)

I got you cornered girl Where you gonna go
Up against the wall like an animal
Breathe deep, show your teeth Underneath the lies
I know your love could be one a kind girl

And I know that karma's comin' back for you
Baby this is just a game for two
You know better not now

Some days I don't feel like tryin
Some days I can't take the lyin'
Today's the day that I'll be flyin' away yeah
I gave you all that you needed

So why do I feel defeated And now my heart is depleted
Can't find my way eh eh

Stop girl, in the name of love
Stop girl, in the name of love Eh Eh
Stop girl in the name of love
And just like a dream I know your love isn't real

Don't wanna push you away again
No choice, even though you're my only friend
Someone told me that you're lyin' to me again
Like a note that you always forgot to send

Seal me up then send me away
Maybe we can try again another day
Uh, 'til that the only words I gotta say
You're tripping girl, get up and out of ma way

Stop girl, in the name of love
Baby don't you care about the way you makin' me feel
Stop girl in the name of love
And just like a dream I know your love isn't real

Sayin' that your busy But your time is up
Don't ever try to call me Cause I won't pick up
Sayin' that your busy But your time is up
Don't ever try to call me Cause I won't pick up
Stop girl, in the name of love
