LOVE ON U

Hey girl, I wanna show you something
I'm gonna come to you then, yeah, see you in a bit

Hitome mita toki kara darenimo tebanasenai
The gold in your eyes, girl I gotta make you mine
(Kiss kiss) takamari dasu kodo
(Kiss kiss) taiyo ga mezameru mae ni
I'm trying to figure out

Seijaku ni kanaderu melody
(I'll be the one to love your heart)
Yume ga samenu yo ni

Get ready for love on u, love on u
You're driving me crazy
Calling you, calling you
Love like never before
Take me kimi to doko ka e
Take me nukedashitai
Tell me what you want (want want)
Love on u, love on u

With me, you're headed down the right path
I can change you're life
Have you saying how we doing that
Red pumps, you get the best names
And let me hear you say it
One let's go

(Kiss kiss) nari yamanai shodo
(Kiss kiss) kakureta hitomi no oku ni
Hisomu moeru daiyamondo

Hoshitsuki o kimitoboku dake no
(Nobody but you and me)
Himitsu no ibasho

Get ready for love on u, love on u
You're driving me crazy
Calling you, calling you
Love like never before
Let me kiminosobade
Let me nemuritai
Tell me what you want (want want)
Love on u, love on u

I'll stay with you (I'll stay with you), wish it won't all be over
I'm falling for you (you know girl), I wanna love you
Do kakono toki ga itsuka togirenai yo ni
Yume ga tsudzuku yo ni

Get ready for love on u, love on u
You're driving me crazy (drive me crazy)
Calling you, calling you
Love like never before (never before)
Take me kimi to doko ka e
Take me nukedashitai

One true lover I can be your one true lover
Kantan ni owaranai futari no saki mitai zutto

Let me kiminosobade
Let me nemuritai
Tell me what you want (want want)
Love on u, love on u

Baby, I think you and I can make it through together
I need you here by my side
Please be my love... you're my diamond
