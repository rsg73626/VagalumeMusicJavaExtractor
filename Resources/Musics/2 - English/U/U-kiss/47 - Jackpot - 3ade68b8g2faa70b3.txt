JACKPOT

I got a black flame burnin' on the inside
In the kitchen (feelin' so upset)
Look at myself I'm a nervous wreck
Thinkin' back to the times
Ridin' on my father's back
Need to get my life on track

I ain't a cat (and) I ain't got nine lives
It's just me myself and I, need to survive
And my whole life I've been walkin' this tight rope
Across this bottomless pit and now it's time to dive
Jodan nante hitsuyo naidarou?
Saijokyu no ai o miseyou oh yeah
So, then I'm dying 2b real but you're beside me
Oh, chance wa monidoto konai sa
Karada o kogasu shodo ga I kiwado I ai ni obore tetai

Darenimo jama nanka sa senai sa
Kono yoru o nogashi wa shinai
Mirai o tsukamu hon'no dake de
Kiwado I rain o tobikoeyou oh
Ichi-byo-saki no jackpot
Ore no mono sa inside bet "hit" ayaui smile
Azatoi style nayamashi baransu no jive
Unmei no roulette de ima
Tobira ga hirakou to shite iru
So no subete ga specially-te ni shitai

Jozetsuna hodo barete iru no sa
Saijokai no yume o miseyou oh yeah
Oh, then I'm dying 2 b real but you' re
Beside me oh, kairaku dake ja mitasa renai
Karada o kogasu shodo ga I kiwado I yume ni midare tetai
Darenimo jama nanka sa senai sa
Megami yo ore dake aishite mada
Minu sekai no sono sakini aru
Kiwado I mirai o ubaitai

And now it's time for me to hit the jackpot
Get yo hands out of (my back pocket)
Become a rap bot (I'm)
Dying to be real
That's my whole lifes deal
While you (other haters) dyin' from my sex appeal
Going 100 miles with my tank half full
With my honey to my right got a lot to pull
My tanks still full ain't goin' empty
You can't break me like they did humpty dumpty
