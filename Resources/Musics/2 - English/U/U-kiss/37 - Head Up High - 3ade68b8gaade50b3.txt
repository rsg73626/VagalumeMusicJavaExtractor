HEAD UP HIGH

So life is bringing you down
Itsumo jibun ni iiwake sa
Feels like the world's coming down
Mawari ga do demo just don't care

Mukashi kaita peiji o hirakeba
Hora iroaseta ima kagayaki dasu

Someday you'll fly
Hatenai sora ni makenai yo
Keep your head up high
Kokai mo ke chirashitai
I'll show you the world
Show me your world
I'll show you the world
I'll always be there for you

Just feel the breeze in your heart
Kareta kokoro ni mizu agete
Just too late if you don't start
Toki ni hitsuyo chotto no puressha

Moeru taiyo te o nobaseba hora
Nani demo dekiru heart moyasou

Someday you'll fly
Mirai no sora ni yumemaite
Keep your head up high
Namida sae hana o sakase
I'll show you the world
Show me your world
I'll show you the world
I'll always be there for you

Yeah mado no katen akete mireba I
Heya ni hikari o irete
Doa no moku soko wa brand new day

Someday you'll fly
Hirogaru sekai kimi no yume
Keep your head up high
Kokai mo ke chirashitai
I'll show you the world
Show me your world
I'll show you the world
I'll always be there for you
