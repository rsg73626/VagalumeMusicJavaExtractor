SKELETONS

The skeletons out and every mistake
That you've ever made, that you've ever made
Has found it's way back, back to this place
Where all your mistakes are bound to replay

Swallow your pride for just one more night
It's just one more drink a reason to hide
And cake it on so you can take it off
Bare your scars and prove to yourself
That you earned them

I'd like to see you undone
Undone!

Everyday's another new face
The motives the same, but nothing will change
It's a cover up

I'd like to see you undone
Undone!

At this rate you'll be, at this rate you'll be
Almost gone before you even know who you are

You're all lit up like a car fire
Eager to burn, eager to burn

I'd like to see you undone
Undone!
