KEEP YOUR LEFT UP

It's this feeling you can't hold in. You have to let it out.
This will bury you, if you don't let it go.
You ask yourself to start again and you can't find one reason.

Lets take this lightly only this time we'll focus on what we want to be,
Only this time we'll see.

You're falling down why don't you pick yourself up?
(With no one else to blame) When will you be free?

Make your move now, time runs slowly.
The hour hand is not quite your friend.
Can you feel it? It cuts closer. It's taking you.

Let's take this lightly only this time we'll focus on what we want to be.
Only this time we'll see.

You're falling down why don't you pick yourself up?
(With no one else to blame) When will you be free? It's been so long now.

You'll feel this when it hits you.

You're falling down why don't you pick yourself up?
(With no one else to blame) When will you be free? It's been so long now
