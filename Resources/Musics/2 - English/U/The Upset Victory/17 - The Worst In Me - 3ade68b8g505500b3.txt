THE WORST IN ME

Hey sister, I missed ya
Where have you been lately?
Did you get lost inside my eyes?
My minds a dark place I cannot imagine that
You'll ever make it out alive
Alive!

Why don't you take a picture
Carry it 'round with ya
I don't want you always seeing the worst in me

Let's face it I'm a wreck
Hell I amaze myself
It's best you stay away from here
You can't leave well
You can't leave well enough alone

I don't think you'll make it out alive
I don't think you'll make it out

The worst! [x4]
The worst in me...
The worst! [x5]
I don't think you'll make it out alive
I don't think you'll make it out

Why don't you take a picture
Carry it 'round with ya
I don't want you always seeing the worst in me
