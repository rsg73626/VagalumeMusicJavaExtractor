RISE

Rise up!

We are surrounded
Got our backs against the wall
This ground was hallowed
Now it's just cushion for the fall

Rise up like a Phoenix from the ashes
We need to rise up like a Phoenix from the ashes

Stand up and fight with me tonight
Can't do this on my own [x2]

I'll be your beacon
Drug out in the streets and left to burn
Let's not be shy now
Go give 'em just what they deserve!

Rise up like a Phoenix from the ashes
We need to rise up like a Phoenix from the ashes

Stand up and fight with me tonight
Can't do this on my own [x2]
On my own...

I'm not scared to die, but I can't do this on my own

Spare us your excuses, Show us no mercy [x2]
No mercy...

Stand up and fight with me tonight
Can't do this on my own [x2]
