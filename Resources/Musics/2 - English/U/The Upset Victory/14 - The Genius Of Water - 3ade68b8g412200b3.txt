THE GENIUS OF WATER

Finally, You and I will meet between the walls and worlds that sleep
My anchor keeps me grounded on the desert ocean floor
(The sky is set ablaze)
I'll stand my ground down here

If I studied the chemistry of the sea,
With steadfast resolve,
Has "god" been solved?
Will I evolve?
As our light spreads, the world grows dark.
All that's left, "what caused the spark?"
(And then what next?)
Too late to slow down for such a hopeless mess

How did we end up alone in this?
Did we ever exist? Or am I already a ghost?
A fragment of someone else's conscious
A reflection in the mirror

All those who mock their chains are not truly free.
One by one they march,
When hell is full the dead will walk the earth.
We're searching for the same thing,
So scream in crowded rooms and hold a candle
For we sing to our indifferent lives.

How did we end up alone in this?
Did we ever exist? Or am I already a ghost?
A fragment of someone else's conscious
A reflection in the mirror

All of us thought up by the genius of water.

How did we end up alone in this?
Did we ever exist? Or am I already a ghost?
A fragment of someone else's conscious
A reflection in the mirror

The genius of water
