THE RECOVERY PROCESS

Today I wake up by myself and I am half on empty.
And I know I hear a thousand voices,
Pulling me into my own submission again.

And we go on thinking what could we have done to prevent this,
From happening once again.
It makes no sense. It makes no sense to...

Bury myself in regret.
Bear this weight down on my chest.
It takes my breath.
A lack of words won't make up for what's been lost.
For what's been lost.

And we go on thinking what could we have done to prevent this,
From happening once again.
It makes no sense. It makes no sense to...

I can't stand to see the tracers blinding me.
I don't want to be the one who's lost.

I don't want to be the one who is lost.
Hard to remember
