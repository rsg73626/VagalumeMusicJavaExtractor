A WORLD OUTSIDE

If I held your hand do you think it's help at all?

On the Tv screaming "rapture, rapture
Oh my lord, the trouble that I've know!"
Such a shame to see this life we're wasting
While we're chasing death like it's a crown

Is it to late to save the world
Now that sky is falling?

All the walls we built are telling secrets
There's a million reasons to give up
But there's a world outside your window
Patiently burning, silent, but true

Is it to late to save the world
Now that sky is falling?

Go tell your god that my world is worth saving
Go tell your god that my world is worth saving
If I held your hand, if I held your hand
Do you think it'd help at all?
