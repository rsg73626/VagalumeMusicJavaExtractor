ACTIONS

Throw out the scriptures
Sink your teeth into something that's real
Don't let the dead out live you
Don't rot your teeth on sweet nothings
We're all desperate for change but tragically tongue tied

Save your breath because actions speak louder than words
Make a stand because actions speak louder than words

No more metaphors it's not what we're meant for
All of these meaningless lines took us over
We make these promises to give our lives for this

Save your breath because actions speak louder than words
Make a stand because actions speak louder than words

In this symphony the sound of the movement will prevail

Save your breath because actions speak louder than words
Make a stand because actions speak louder than words
