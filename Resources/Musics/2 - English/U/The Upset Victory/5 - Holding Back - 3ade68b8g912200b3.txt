HOLDING BACK

It comes without warning, got up your guard
But you were never prepared for it
You got all these great big dreams, you like to brag
But I can already tell you're holding back just a little bit

You're holding back just a little bit, just a little bit
You're holding back just a little bit, just a little bit

You sleep with the lights on although you swear
You're not afraid of the dark, yeahhh
You say you wanna see everything all of the time
But your blinded by the light and you're scared you might find
That what you see isn't anything...

You're holding back just a little bit, just a little bit
You're holding back just a little bit, just a little bit
We never wanna miss out
But far to proud to fail, so we fold
You're holding back just a little bit

Try hard to remember
But your so full of regrets
That your life becomes a prison
You're desperate to escape

You got all these great big dreams...

You're holding back just a little bit, just a little bit
You're holding back just a little bit, just a little bit
We never wanna miss out
But far to proud to fail, so we fold
You're holding back just a little bit

You say you wanna see everything all of the time
But your blinded by the light and you're scared you might find
That what you see isn't anything...
