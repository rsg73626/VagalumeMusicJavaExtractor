MY TURN TO PLAY THE VILLAIN

What can I say? It's my turn to play the villain now.
I bet you can relate, to what I've grown to hate.
You won't feel this. You won't feel a thing.

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.

It's not my turn to fall. It's your turn after all...
This revenge is catching up to you, better slow it down.
Refusing to sink in. Giving up was your way then (this battle has yet to begin).

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.
Rest assured now.

This is where decision meets consequence.
I'll find a comeback at the bottom of this glass again.
You won't feel a thing.

We're on our way down (this blackout won't shed light on this)
Rest assured I can't forget.

Rest assured now
