THE WILL

Leave our present to create a future, evolve to exist
I'm still fighting those monsters, 
the ones we've fed and kept in closets.
The nightmare has found us again.
The sea will render up our drowned
We have to make the myths, invent a million reasons why.

A war has begun; we refuse to be fodder
as the cannons roar, this could all end

Before we start digging our trenches
Sleep with a sword to cut our ruin
I'll lye merciless, savoring what I've become

A war has begun; we refuse to be fodder 
as the cannons roar, this could all end
We're fighting to exist. life means more on the brink of collapse

If the seas should rise, the earth will flood
I will cross the waters when worlds divide

A war has begun; we refuse to be fodder 
as the cannons roar, this could all end
We're fighting to exist. life means more on the brink of collapse
