FLEE THE SCENE

Mixed messages in every word
I know this tongue don't always make the best impression
But it's well equipped to keep you guessing
It's getting old, I knew it would
But every line has means to buy some time
Till I can finally find what I am truly searching

Searching for...

I fled the scene to capture my dream
Goodbye, cuz I may never make it home

I put you out it's such a crime
Of mine to find that my life has been inconvenient to you
It's criminal, oh it's such a waste of time
Turn off the lights I'm in my prime
I haven't had the chance to shine as bright as I know how to
Shine as bright as you know how to!

I fled the scene to capture my dream
Goodbye, cuz I may never make it home
