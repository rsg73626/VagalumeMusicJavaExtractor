ON THE SCENT OF YOUR INTENT

It seems you don't care anymore
I cursed your name all the way to the car
Under my breath like a secret kept
Between friends, but it's constantly prying at
Loose lips and abandoned heart
And it spreads, it spreads like fire and I'm
Already set, fueled by regret
I'm in flames and watching this burn to the ground

Have you ever aspired to let it all go?
Have you ever been betrayed by someone love?
Where have you been?
You've been missing
I'm stuck trying to make sense of your intent

I know there's still words to be shared
I'm looking for some alternatives here
I could write you off, hell we never talk
It'd be so effortless you would hardly notice
I admit it I can be a cynic, but I'll be damned
If you don't always prove me right

Have you ever aspired to let it all go?
Have you ever been betrayed by someone love?
Where have you been?
You've been missing
I'm stuck trying to make sense of your intent

Our hearts tailored to give and forgive
I'll keep on giving till nothing is left
If I keep on giving I'll forget how to live
Our hearts are to give and forget!

Have you ever aspired to let it all go?
Have you ever been betrayed by someone love?
Where have you been?
You've been missing
I'm stuck trying to make sense of your intent
