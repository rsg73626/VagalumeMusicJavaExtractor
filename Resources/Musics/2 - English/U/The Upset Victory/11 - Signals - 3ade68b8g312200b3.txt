SIGNALS

This fades away as I awaken to self-realization, self-realization
Rub the sand away from my eyes
It's clear to see that we both can't breathe
We inhale these thoughts, but we never breathe out

My lungs are bursting
With things we should have said
With closure close at hand
Come to your senses this doesn't have to end
I see the signals now

Behind the lies you live, creates the distance, as tension grows between us
Can we just tonight forgo everything in our lives?

My lungs are bursting
With things we should have said
With closure close at hand
Come to your senses this doesn't have to end
I see the signals now

I'm self-prepared willing to see this through
Waiting patiently, but I can't wait for you

My lungs are bursting
With things we should have said
With closure close at hand
Come to your senses this doesn't have to end
I see the signals now

This fades away
