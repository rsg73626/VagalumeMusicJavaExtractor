IRON SIGHTS

Get off me, get off of me I got a bone to pick with you
The night is just starting
I've got nothing left to lose
Tarnish each memory with a passive turn a phrase
Friends become enemies
So here's to lonely nights

No, no, no don't leave me in the dark
No, no, no don't leave me in the dark

Who are you? Who are you?
All these whispers sound so shrill
I've read every letter hoping to find a way to heal

An answer...a saving a grace
An answer...

No, no, no don't leave me in the dark
No, no, no don't leave me in the dark

Now that the faithful, the faithful, have lost their will to love
See if we don't, bite 'till we choke, choke 'till we can't speak

An answer, a saving grace...
An answer...

No, no, no don't leave me in the dark
No, no, no don't leave me in the dark

Don't leave me in the dark
