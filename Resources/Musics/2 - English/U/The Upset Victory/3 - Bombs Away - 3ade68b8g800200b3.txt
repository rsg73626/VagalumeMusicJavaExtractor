BOMBS AWAY

It's not quite surrender when these things get the best of you
(These things get the best of you).
In spite of all my efforts, trying never seems to lose.

Imagine if the bridges we've burned could be built again.

Searching for a sign to help me remember.
Searching for cut time to put back together.

When adding fuel doesn't light the fire now it's up to me.
These memories are fleeting of what this used to be.

Imagine if the bridges we've burned could be built again.

Searching for a sign to help me remember.
Searching for cut time to put back together.
It's not quite surrender...

Tell me what I'd give to reason and understand all this pressure building up inside,
Never spilling out.
Let's start this from inception to regain what's been lost.

Searching for a sign to help me remember.
Searching for cut time to put back together.
It's not quite surrender
