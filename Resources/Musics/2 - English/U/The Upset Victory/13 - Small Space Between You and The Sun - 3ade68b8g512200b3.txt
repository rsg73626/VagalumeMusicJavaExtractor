SMALL SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE SUN

Awake and arise
Waiting for your face and your name
The throne is yours to reclaim
It's yours once again

I've lied in slumber for a thousands years
The sea is my keeper
Been buried by fear
Who'll be the one to call me home?
To regain the seat of the now unknown

Behold the hand that holds our freedom

The waning is killing us, how can you sleep?
If the heavens should fall, in the halls
Of our kings.
Reclaim your throne!!!

We dream!
You sing!
For your return!
I can lead a fleet of ships to wreckage
Outside the dome of heaven
Behold the hand that holds our freedom
All is lost if we never see him (again)

The waning is killing us, how can you sleep?
If the heavens should fall, in the halls
Of our kings.
Reclaim your throne!!!

These skies are yours for the taking
These skies are yours

The waning is killing us, how can you sleep?
If the heavens should fall, in the halls
Of our kings.
Reclaim your throne!!!

Be patient!
I've been planning my escape
