SPEEDER

Switch on the power
Screaming fast
Lungs are burning? sucking in the dust
Like a freebird
Flying high
Tearing up the atmosphere - ripping up the sky

it's faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

No way to stop it
Out of control
It has no limits? I want it all
High as a fever
Extreme and hot
Terrifies your braincells? it never stops

it's faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

Speeder - deadlier then all
Speeder - like a thunderstorm
Speeder - like a wrecking ball
Speeder - faster then you all

Redline the hour
Coming fast
Countdown to zero? like a lightning blast

A supernova
Radiates
A thunderwall? it's coming in your face

it's faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

Speeder - deadlier then all
Speeder - like a thunderstorm
Speeder - like a wrecking ball
Speeder - faster then you all

Speeder
