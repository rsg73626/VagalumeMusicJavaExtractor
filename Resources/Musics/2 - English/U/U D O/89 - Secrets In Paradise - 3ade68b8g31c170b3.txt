SECRETS IN PARADISE

It was a perfect dream
A lovely wonder scene
It took me over and I surrendered
I felt the harmony
Was like a symphony
Drifting on a broken cloud
Then I wandered - nothing conquered
I had my faith - lost in time - lost in memory

I was lost in pain
Free from shame
Beauty has a consequence
Now I realised
It was cold as ice
Staring at a frozen mirror

Now the curtains closed? like a dying rose
No more fantasy for me
For me

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn? t show

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn? t show
Why you left me all alone

Now I feel the loneliness
My bleeding heart is aching less

What a meaning - what a feeling

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn? t show

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didn? t show
Why you left me all alone

No more secrets in paradise
