MASTERCUTOR

Welcome back everybody
Have you missed us
Well, tonight we bring you
More of the same
Our special guest tonight is
Chainsaw Eddy
And our surprise spot is
Dismemberment
Don’t forget:
You have to be in it to kill it
And your host tonight is:
The Mastercutor

Wheel of fortune turned to terror
Jeopardy was bastardised
The arena of Big Brother
Roman games disqualified

B. stars in the jungle
Eating bugs and shit
Watching egos crumble
Golden bullets hit

Mastercutor’s ready
Axeman’s coming down
Gallows hanging steady
Claim the winner’s crown

Rolling diamonds feed your pleasure
Frenzied sick man’s appetite
Kill your friends to find the treasure
Desperate wide-eyed sacrifice
