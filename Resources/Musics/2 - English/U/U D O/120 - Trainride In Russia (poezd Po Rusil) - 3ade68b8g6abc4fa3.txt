TRAINRIDE IN RUSSIA (POEZD PO RUSIL)

Poezd Po Rossii – Idet I Idet
Poezd Po Rossii – Sto Gramm I Vpered
Pérestuk Koles – Neob’yatna Dal‘
Poezd Nas Unes – K Natshalu Vscech Natshal
Here I Tell My Story
Believe What I Have Seen
And Nothing Had Prepared Us
The Welcome We Received
Coming Back From Kazachstan
The Gear Has Not Arrived
The Fans Geared Up And Ready
We Rocked Them For Their Lives
Trainride In Russia - Again And Again
Trainride In Russia - Nastrovje Man To Man
The Rolling Of The Wheels - The Distance Of The Land
Trainride In Russia - That’s Where It All Began
With Igor And With Fitty
Naked In The Car
Shouting At Each Other
Who The Fuck’s The Tsar
Swetlana Was A Darling
Her Face Will Never Fade
She Made Lorenzo Happy
Showed Him The Russian Way
Chorus
And Our Crew Was Blinded
A Challenge They Did Raise
The Russian Guys Were Ready
And Won The Vodka Race
When Drinking With The Pilots
A Southern Comfort Round
Then Stefan’s Fear Of Flying
Came Crashing To The Ground
Chorus
Parading For Their Victory
Army, Air And Corps
Looking Up The Building
Where Udo Was The Star
And When The Tour Is Over
We’re Never Quite The Same
Already Miss Our Comrades
Until We Meet Again
