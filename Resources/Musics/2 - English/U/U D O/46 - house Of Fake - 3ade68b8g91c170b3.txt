HOUSE OF FAKE

You are the bastard that's behind the mask
You are the lying living proof
You are the bad dog bites the hand
You wouldn't recognise the truth
I burn you down to the ground

You are the clown like all the rest
I'd like to flush you down the tube
I smell you like a sewer rat
you're always fucking up the rules

I burn you down to the ground

we're living in a house of fake
What you mean
he's done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

You are the master of the war machine
Evidence is blinded by your truth
So take away this masquerade
You are nothing without us

I burn you down to the ground

we're living in a house of fake
What you mean
he's done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

I'm gonna break the spell
And send you right to hell
And take away this fucking chain

It's time for you to run
Your crimes have been undone
And now the change has just begun

we're living in a house of fake
What you mean
he's done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

we're living we're living
What you see
In a house of fake
we're living we're living
What you see
we're living we're living
What you see
In a house of fake
we're living we're living
What you see
