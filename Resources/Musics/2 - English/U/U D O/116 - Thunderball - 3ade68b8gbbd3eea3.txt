THUNDERBALL

I ate the moon for breakfast

I had the sun for tea

I opened up the papers

And drank the oval sea

I beat the holy armies

I claimed my own terrain

I forced away the darkness

And cauterised my pain

I’ll live my dreams - and I’ll have it all

All in the day and the night

Time after time - I never go wrong

Watch out - you better hold tight

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball

I walked upon the desert

And scaled the mountains high

Gave water to the rivers

And painted up the sky

I’ve played with all the planets

Took life away from Mars

And all my magic power

Gave light to all the stars


Ride the thunderball

The thunderball - read the book of lies

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball - the shock of life

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball - do you believe

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball - have the ride of your life

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball - believe in lies

Ride the thunderball

The thunderball - between the lines
