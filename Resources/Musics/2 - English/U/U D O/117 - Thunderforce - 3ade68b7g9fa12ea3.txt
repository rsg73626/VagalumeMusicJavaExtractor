THUNDERFORCE

Thunder- thunderforce
Thunder- thunderforce

In a lonely night- stars are shining bright
My soul is wandering- striking the universe
I am flying to a light- to a point of no return
In the name of a master- some spirit picks me up

Oh- I feel the heat
Getting attacked- I'm fighting back
Oh- is this the light- the light of glory

Thunder- thunderforce- lightning strikes again
Thunder- thunderforce- lightning strikes again

Getting closer- you will see- the master- that's yourself, oh yeah

Oh- I feel the heat
Getting attacked- I'm fighting back
Oh- is this the light- the light of glory

Thunder- thunderforce- lightning strikes again
Thunder- thunderforce- lightning strikes again

Thunder- thunderforce- striking the universe
Thunder- thunderforce- getting attacked- I'm fighting back

Thunder- thunderforce- lightning strikes again
Thunder- thunderforce- dancing on fire- dancing in hell

Thunderforce
