THE PUNISHER

One day you're ostracised
And then you're mesmerised
The goal is freedom for us all

We are all believers

We think we own the world
It sends us crashing down
And in an instant he arrives

We are strong believers
He's the retriever

He holds the book in his hand
To bring us back where we belong

He is the punisher - he can tell if you lie
He is the punisher - one mistake and you die
He is the punisher - there is only one right
He is the punisher - he takes an eye for an eye

He's made in one design
The price is piece of mind
Instead of hatred there is pride

We are strong believers

He senses everytime
The past and future crimes
He's east and west he's so divine

He holds the book in his hand
To bring us back where we belong

He is the punisher - he can tell if you lie
He is the punisher - one mistake and you die
He is the punisher - you can't elect him out
He is the punisher - he is the one we crowned

He's omnipresant in our world and rules the game
The punisher just treats the same

He holds the book in his hand
To bring us back where we belong

He is the punisher - he can tell if you lie
He is the punisher - one mistake and you die
He is the punisher - there is only one right
He is the punisher - he takes an eye for an eye

He is the punisher - you can't elect him out
He is the punisher - he is the one we crowned
Punisher - he is the punisher
Punisher - he is the punisher
