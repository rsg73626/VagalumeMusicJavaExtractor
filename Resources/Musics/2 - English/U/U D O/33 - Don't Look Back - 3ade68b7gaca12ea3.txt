DON'T LOOK BACK

Sometimes I remember my life
The wheels been spinning so long
So many years have passed me by
And the feelings are still running oh so strong

Now something new is here
I'm gonna fly and spread my wings
And still the power, goes, on and on

Don't look back- Don't look back
Don't you ever, now or never, look back
Don't look back- Don't look back
Don't you ever- never look back

Day after day, night after night
Climbing into a new day
And now I think I've found my sight
To go on and never turn away

Now something new...

Don't look back- Don't look back
Don't you ever, now or never, look back
Don't look back- Don't look back
now or never- Don't you ever look back

SOLO

I'm gonna fly and spread my wings
cause still the power goes on and on

Don't look back...
