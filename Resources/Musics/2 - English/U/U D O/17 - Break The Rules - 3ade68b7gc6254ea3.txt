BREAK THE RULES

Break The Rules

Everything is wrong, yet they all deny it
But the time will come, when they can't hide it
Somebody says hey man- what's up with you
I say "just make way" cause I'm sick of you

Sick 'n tired of no good two faced liars
Buck here- buck there, that's their sole desire
Leaders always put your life in fear
I don't wanna see the world disappear

You got to burn it up- burn it up tonight
Cause the time has come for us- to put it right

You gotta break the rules, so keep the aces high
Break the rules- break the rules
Burn 'em down with fire

No good thinking you don't have the power
Cause it's coming soon it's gonna be our finest hour
All I do is smile because I've been thru this before
I know just how to play this game- I'm kicking down your door

You got to burn it up- burn it up tonight...

You gotta break the rules, so keep the aces high
Break the rules- break the rules
Burn 'em down with fire
You gotta break the rules, so keep the aces high
Break the rules- break the rules
Burn 'em down with fire

[SOLO]

You gotta break the rules...
