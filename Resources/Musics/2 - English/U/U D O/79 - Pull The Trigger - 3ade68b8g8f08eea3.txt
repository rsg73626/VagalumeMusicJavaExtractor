PULL THE TRIGGER

Call up the guns

Beat on the drums

Join the hell

Grey magazines

Evil machines

Zero two ten

Eighty-eight millimetre mortar rounds

AK 47’s make a hell of a sound

Rolling thunder’s gonna get the better of you

If you wanna get ahead and win the hearts and minds

You gotta pull - pull - pull - pull the trigger

Fire your guns

You gotta pull - pull - pull - pull the trigger

Fire your guns

Pick up the phone

Start up the drones

Radio base

Head outta town

On enemy ground

Nothing to tell


CHORUS

Chain of command

News on demand

Security leaks

Innocent lives

Desperate lies

Deny all reports



CHORUS
