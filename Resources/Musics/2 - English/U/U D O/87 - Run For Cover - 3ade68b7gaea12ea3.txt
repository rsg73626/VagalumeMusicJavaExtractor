RUN FOR COVER

See the man in white
He's old he wouldn't dare to fight, to fight another
Rockin' like a beast upon on a never ending dream
We love each other

Asking for a sign - the action's coming from behind
Let's run for cover
Feel the music's beat, we fight for rock
And in the heat we stand together

We're holding back for you when you fight
And we stand for one another
We're holding back for you, when you run for cover

And see those open eyes
When you are standing here tonight
That's why - We're holding back for you, when you run for cover
Restless in the night, we all stand up for this delight
We fight together

We're holding back for you when you fight
And we stand for one another
We're holding back for you, when you run for cover

We're holding back for you..........
