PRIVATE EYE

I’m always watching you - my secret eye
No chance to hide away - I’m not that blind
No matter what you do - it’s watching you
I’ll be your second mind - controlling you

So don’t forget - you’re not alone
I will command you - one and all

‘cause I’m your private eye
Your private eye
‘cause I’m your private eye
Your private eye

Electro magnify - the metal eye
Corruption’s rectified - a legal crime
Invading privacy - with hidden force
Imprinted on the screen - and no remorse

I will be everywhere - eye in the sky
All actions will be saved - no matter why
I will manipulate - defy and lie
Recordings will go on - until you die
