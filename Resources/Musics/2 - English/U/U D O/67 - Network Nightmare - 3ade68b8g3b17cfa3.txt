NETWORK NIGHTMARE

You’re gonna drown out
While you’re within the net
A megatronic murder
Upon the world wide web

My mind is „read all memory“
Your access is denied
A massive infestation
Infected RAM inside

I smile - while I’m infecting your veins
My style - I’m Dr. No I’m delivering the blow

I’m your network nightmare
I’m your network nightmare

I’ll powersurge the virus
Directly to your brains
A gigabotic meltdown
Manic - cold - insane

I activate the relay
The master of the code
Expect hard driven lessons
All systems overload
