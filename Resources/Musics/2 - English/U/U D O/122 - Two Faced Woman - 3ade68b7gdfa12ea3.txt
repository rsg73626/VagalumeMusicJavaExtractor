TWO FACED WOMAN

Miles from home
So many things go 'round
So far - the fight in me so strong

Years of pain
I've suffered all the same
Today - I know I will be near

You talk about romance
You blew your only chance

'cause you're a two faced woman
But I'm a three faced man
'cause you're a two faced woman
I got a hangman's hand

Dirty tricks
I found out just in time
Enough - don't dare to cross the line

You - you fooled around
I found a way out
The tables turned - your bridges burned

You talk about romance
You blew your only chance

'cause you're a two faced woman
But I'm a three faced man
'cause you're a two faced woman
I got a hangman's hand

'cause you're a two faced woman
But I'm a three faced man
'cause you're a two faced woman
You'll live in nightmare land

Payback time - spin the dime
The balance overdue
Payback time - take a hike
You broke the golden rule

'cause you're a two faced woman
But I'm a three faced man
'cause you're a two faced woman
I got a hangman's hand

'cause you're a two faced woman
But I'm a three faced man
'cause you're a two faced woman
You'll live in nightmare land
