BACK OFF

Respect our rotten life
Better not be hypnotised this time
You talk a heavy load
A mental overdose you're slime

Open up your mind
Welcome to the gates of nowhere
Freedom's not for sale
We are the right - 'cause we are the law

So back off - power in a minute
Back off - bastard hard and combat high
Back off - power is a winner
Back off - don't you cross this line

We're true and metalised
These crazy territorial nights
'n' red-hot burning roads
We are the predators of life

So back off - gotta be a limit
Back off - bastard hard and combat high
Back off - power is a winner
Back off - don't you cross this line
