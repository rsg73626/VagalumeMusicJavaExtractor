FACELESS WORLD

Listen to me - this is a warning
You have to wake up out of this dream
Don't be a member of this lifestyle, please
I hear the beat of your heart

So better watch them - don't be frightened
Can't you feel it - can't you see it this time
So many things appear like wonders
Be shameless my friend - save what you've got

Welcome to this crazy world
You cannot blame everyone

See the stars and see the rainbows - see it all
Don't turn away - you're all you've got
In a faceless world
You can run - but you can't hide
It's yourself who waits for you inside

So believe me it's not evil
To break out of this spell
Don't be wasting a whole lifetime
Don't betray yourself anymore

So hear me calling - this is a warning
When you feel it - don't lose it this time
One day you will be way stronger
Be clever old friend, cause then you'll be free

Welcome to this crazy world
You cannot blame everyone
Dreams can come true

See the stars and see the rainbows - open your eyes
Don't turn away - you're all you've got
In a faceless world
You can run - but you can't hide
It's yourself who waits for you inside

So hear me calling
Don't wanna mistreat anymore
Just one desire
I want to break this spell

No more wondering
I wanna be clever this time
I hear your warning
I just wanna be myself

Saw the stars and all the rainbows - you've seen it all
You realized - you're all you've got
In the faceless world
You tried to run - but couldn't hide
It was you who found yourself inside

So hear me calling
Stop betraying yourself
Don't waste all your lifetime
You've been mistreated so many times
In this faceless world
You've got to break out of this spell
Listen to your heartbeat
Be restless my friend
Just one desire
I just wanna be myself
