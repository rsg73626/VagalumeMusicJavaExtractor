WITH A VENGEANCE

Now I'm back with a vengeance

Didn't want to stay  - to stay away from you
No illegal fun - you had me hypnotised
Cheap and on the run - a bad reputation
Now the time has come - to take the blame away

To fly the clouds so high
And touch the sun
Into a desperate sky
And the nightmare's begun

Now I'm back with a vengeance
I am back with a vengeance

Never been my style - to hide away from you
Like a wayward child - you tried to paralyse
And to cage my heart - bad recommendation
Now the fear has gone - there's zero left to say

To fly the clouds so high
And touch the sun
Into a desperate sky
Wait for the terror to come

Now I'm back with a vengeance
I am back with a vengeance

To fly the clouds so high
And touch the sun
Into a desperate sky
So the horror has won

Now I'm back with a vengeance
I am back with a vengeance, ...
