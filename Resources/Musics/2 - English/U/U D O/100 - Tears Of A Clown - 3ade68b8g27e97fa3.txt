TEARS OF A CLOWN

All his life he did his best for all
And the crown of laughter hanging low
The spotlight in the ring
The choruses that sing
The paint and masquerade was just a show

The clown - the clown
Happiness around
Just a soul lonely in the crowd
The clown - the clown
His heart is all alone
No one wants the tears of a clown

The living of the glory and applause
The circus tent, the only home he knows
The cover-up is bold,
The mask becoming cold
It's easier to let the eyelids close

The final curtain falls for all to see
The final score, the circus melody
His star that shone so bright,
Gave comfort in the night
The light that always held him set him free
