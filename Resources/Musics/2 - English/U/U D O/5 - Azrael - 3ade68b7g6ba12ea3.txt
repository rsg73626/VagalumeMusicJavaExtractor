AZRAEL

Long ago - in another life
I was innocent - just a child
Transformed my brain into an evil thing
Now I'm a creature of the night

I'm a shadow in the darkness and I'm watching you
Though you can't see me I am always at your side
When I'm on your heels - you see how it feels
To sense the curse of Azrael

In the night - I'll come to you
Your life belongs to me
I wake you up - you stare at me
I'm the last thing that you'll ever see

The panic in your eyes that I have hungered for
Shows me you have realised the truth 
Death comes to the dying - and before your eyes grow dim
The last word on your lips is Azrael

I will destroy your dreams
I will destroy your mind
I will destroy your soul
And then I'll take your life

Sometimes I remember the life I had before
I asked myself was it just a dream
When I close my eyes I see an ocean flowing blood
And in my sleep I hear those fearful screams

So lock your doors - remove the keys
I doesn't matter if you leave or stay
Wherever you go I'll be expecting you
Your resistance is the spice that I crave

When you imagine there's a movement in the shadows
The light around you is weakens more and more
Prepare for the arrival of the uninvited guest
The angel of the darkness - Azrael

I will destroy your dreams
I will destroy your mind
I will destroy your soul
And then I'll take your life, ...
