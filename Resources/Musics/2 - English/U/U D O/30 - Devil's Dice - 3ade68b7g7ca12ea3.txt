DEVIL'S DICE

Jesus Christ was born like me in a stable
His mom and dad did all that they were able
How did they know which way he'd turn
Didn't want to get their fingers burned
To take which path from right or wrong
He picked right and I picked wrong

I see myself swinging in the gentle breeze
Remembering girls and the way they teased
Mama and papa saying this I tell
We loved you boy but you're going to hell

Roll the devil's dice - no second chance
Roll the devil's dice - I did the dead-man's dance
I did the dead-man's dance

Ever since nine I was juvenile
Stealing from pa - did petty crime
Officer said for me no hope
The only good thing for you's a rope
Left me danging high and dry
They picked my bones and the crows took flight

I see myself swinging in the gentle breeze
Remembering girls and the way they teased
Mama and papa saying this I tell
We loved you boy but you're going to hell

Roll the devil's dice - my turn to cast
Roll the devil's dice - and I got the six
Roll the devil's dice - all three of them
Roll the devil's dice - roll the devil's dice

So here I am on judgement day with angels
The Lord Jesus is reckoning the tables
He said I know you, didn't take you long
Been bad down there, didn't string along
You know which way the righteous choose
Gonna swing you high from the reaper's noose

Roll the devil's dice - no second chance
Roll the devil's dice - I did the dead-man's dance
Roll the devil's dice - my turn to cast
Roll the devil's dice - roll the devil's dice
I did the dead-man's dance
