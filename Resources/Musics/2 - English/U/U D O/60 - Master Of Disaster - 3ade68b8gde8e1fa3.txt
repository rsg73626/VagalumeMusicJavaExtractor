MASTER OF DISASTER

Master of disaster
Machinery of lies
Scheming double dealing
Metal battle strike

Turn the other blind eye
Predictability
Confusion for the masses
Institutionality

Master of distortion
Twist it and deny
Photo opportunity
Make the nation cry

Can’t you see through all the lying
Can’t you see the truth
Slip and sliding dirty dealings
Is no sign of proof

Master of disaster
Machinery of lies
Scheming double dealing
Metal battle strike

Corruptible ambassadors
Pockets full of oil
Damn the weak and innocent
Fuck the native soil

Desperate invasions
On land and sea and air
Elitist Christianity
Opposers best beware
