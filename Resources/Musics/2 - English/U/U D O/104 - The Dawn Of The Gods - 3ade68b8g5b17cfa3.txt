THE DAWN OF THE GODS

Tons of steel - it’s how we feel
It’s resurrection
Million ways to win the race
We always tease you

Boiling sound - solid ground
Is what we stand for
All the sins will take you in
We always please you

Hail the metal
Law for one and all
Hail the metal

It’s the dawn of the gods
We’re always fighting for the holy man
Dawn of the gods - raising high and high
It’s the dawn of the gods
We’re always fighting for the holy man
Dawn of the gods - breaking up the sky

Blazing fire - we walk the wire
The right direction
Crazy days is how it pays
We’ll never lose you

So keep in mind - eruptive signs
Of insurrection
We’re here to serve what you deserve
We’ll never fool you
The fear and the terror of mutant mercenary filth
Deceivers of truth - betrayers of faith
Screaming crimson skies bursting forth their energies
Searing scorching flames - the dawning of the gods
