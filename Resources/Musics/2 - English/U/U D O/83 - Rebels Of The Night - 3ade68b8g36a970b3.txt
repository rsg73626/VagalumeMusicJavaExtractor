REBELS OF THE NIGHT

Ring the bell and sound the warning
Heavy cannon burning guns
Will we ever reach the morning
And feel the rising sun
Iron barricades on fire
Can you smell the sweat of fear
Blood is flowing like a river
Screaming people everywhere

Can you hear - the scream of fear
Chaos had begun
Just beware - they don't care
You better start to run
They are rebels of the night
Ready for the fight
And rolling thunder comes
They are rebels of the night
Fighting for a price
Another battle has begun

Corrupted leaders and deceivers
At the table full of shit
Enemies of non believers
Another mother another kid
Can you hear - the scream of fear
Chaos had begun
Just beware - they don't care
You better start to run

They are rebels of the night
Ready for the fight
And rolling thunder comes
They are rebels of the night
Fighting for a price
Another battle has begun

Rebels of the night
Ready for the fight
Fighting for a price
Rebels of the night
Fighting for a price
Ready for the fight

Can you hear - the scream of fear
Chaos had begun
Just beware - they don't care
You better start to run
They are rebels of the night
Ready for the fight
And rolling thunder comes
They are rebels of the night
Fighting for a price
Another battle has begun

Rebels of the night
And rolling thunder comes
Fighting for a price
Another battle has begun
