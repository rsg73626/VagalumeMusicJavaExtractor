PRAY FOR THE HUNTED

No light inside as empty room
Under pressure I can't win
The screams - the pain - it's all inside
All this talking all the time

When there is something left
Talk to me face to face
Expected so much more
I'm sick and tired of it all

Why don't you pray for the hunted
I scream for help to free my heart
You better pray for the hunter
I wonder why you take me apart

The light has diedd and who's to blame
You're the one who messed around
You shook - you took - you played your games
The time has come you're going down

When there is something left
Talk to me face to face
Expected so much more
I'm sick and tired of it all

Why don't you pray for the hunted
I scream for help to free my heart
You better pray for the hunter
I wonder why you take me apart
You take me apart

Why don't you pray for the hunted
You better pray for the hunter
Why don't you pray for the hunted
You better pray for the hunter

Why don't you pray for the hunted
I scream for help to free my heart
You better pray for the hunter
I wonder why you take me apart

Why don't you pray for the hunted
You score no more you've lost this game
You better pray for the hunter
Why do you always have to take me apart
