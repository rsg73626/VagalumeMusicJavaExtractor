THEY WANT WAR

They are young and they're kids
and believe what they see
To do what they've been told
And so they walk away with open eyes

Some are eight or nine or ten
And they die like a fly, and no one knows
Who they are, they're smaller than the gun they load

See their eyes open wide
They died before they ever cried

They die in the streets and they die in the fields
When they do what they've been told
But now they're lying dead
Their eyes are closed

Some are eight or nine or ten
And they die like a fly and no one knows
Who they are, they're smaller than the gun they load

See their eyes open wide, they died before they ever cried
Who taught them how, how to pray
Who told them they're in paradise when they're gonna die

They are blind and they can't fight
They want war
They are blind and they can't fight
They want war
They are blind and they can't fight
They want war
They are blind and they can't fight
They want war
They are blind and they can't fight
They want war
They are blind and they can't fight
They want war...

You're gonna pay the price, you little devil in disguise

For taking life with no regard, you'll go to hell
And there you'll burn

Children in the battlefield, please don't go

Little birds with fluttering hearts, please don't go
