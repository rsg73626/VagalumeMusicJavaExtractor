IN THE DARKNESS

Why am I here now
What have I done
Running on empty- I got nowhere to run

Can't get an answer
Can't get it right
Just try to make it
'till the end of the night

Is there a way to avoid doing wrong
Lead me away from the darkness
Light up my day show me where I belong
Please don't leave me all alone in the darkness

Far in the distance
There is night, there is day
Sounds are waving nets of dismay

Sometimes I'm stuck in a shocking delay
Like in a slow motion movie
I'm reaching out for something to hold
Life slips away in the cold- in the cold

My heart is so cold- my heart is so cold

Why was I turned down
What's going on
I wish there was something that could have been done

How can I get there
Where is the light
How can I make it
'till the end of the night

How can I turn darkness to light
Leaving my fear in the darkness
Is there a way how can I overcome
My restless night's and my fear- and my fear

In the darkness- in the darkness- in the darkness
