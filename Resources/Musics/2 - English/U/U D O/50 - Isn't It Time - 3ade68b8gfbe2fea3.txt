ISN'T IT TIME

Falling in love was the
last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is a warmth 
that I thought I could never find 

(Sitting here all alone)
Just trying to decide
(Whether to go all alone)
Or stay by your side
(Then I stop myself because)
I know I could cry 
I just can't find the answers 
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time 
(Isn't time it took time to wait) 
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time
(Isn't time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake) 

I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong reaching out 
Holding me through the darkest night 

(Sitting here all alone)
Just trying to decide
(Whether to go all alone)
Or stay by your side
(then I stop myself because)
I don't want to cry 
I just can't find the answers 
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time 
(Isn't it time it took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it Time
(Isn't time you took time to wait) 
(Falling in love could be your mistake) 

I feel a warmth in my heart 
And my soul that I never knew
This love affair gives me strength 
That I need just to get me through 

(Sitting here all alone)
Just wondering why
(Then I stop myself because)
I know I could cry
(Then I think of you)
And everything seems alright 
I've finally found the answers 
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe 
Isn't it time 
(Isn't time you don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Isn't it Time
(Isn't time you don't have to wait) 
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Isn't it Time
(Isn't time you don't have to wait) 
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Isn't it Time
(Isn't time you don't have to wait) 
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Isn't it Time
