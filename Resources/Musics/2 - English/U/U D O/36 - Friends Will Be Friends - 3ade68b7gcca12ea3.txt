FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS

A voice in the back - the lies and the fears
No colour but black - the truth disappears

Just by the look in your eyes I can tell
That your honour is gone - you're caught in confusion and pain

Mysterious sounds - hidden in ice
Your lying is found - protective disguise

No one is braking the wheels are forsaken
In sheer overdrive - diamonds and rust
Breaking their lives - I burst them to dust

Friends will be friends
Down on this dirty road
Friends will be friends
One for all

The meaning is wrong - there's no reason why
The logic is gone - it's hard to deny

Friends will be friends
Down on this dirty road
Friends will be friends
All for one - one for all

No one is braking the wheels are forsaken
Diamonds and rust - I burst them to dust
