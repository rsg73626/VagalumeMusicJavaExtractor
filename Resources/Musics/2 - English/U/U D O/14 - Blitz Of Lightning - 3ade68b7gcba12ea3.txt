BLITZ OF LIGHTNING

When it's nice and easy
He can handle the fear
He thought he was burning
With all the pain he had

Then his smile was gone
He didn't know where he was
Can't you hear him cry
This time he is alive

He's out to seek and find
To find his own style in time
No more retreat but fight
So be aware and watch the night, watch the night

Hello world, here I am
Don't you fool me again
I'm like a blitz of lightning
So get outta my way
Every night and day
The lightning strikes again

Then he came to the point
He could believe in his life
A different soul was born
He must no more deny

But he wants to forget
His old rotten desires
No more pain - no more cries
All those things are behind

He's out to seek and find
To find his own style in time
No more retreat but fight
So be aware and watch the night, watch the night

Hello world, here I am
Don't you fool me again
I'm like a blitz of lightning
So get outta my way
Every night and day
The lightning strikes again

Hello world, here I go
Don't fool me, oh no
I'm like a rolling thunder
The story's been told
And my blood runs cold
It won't be all the same

It will never be the same again

Hello world, here I am
Don't you fool me again
I'm like a blitz of lightning
So get outta my way
Every night and day
The lightning strikes again

Hello world, here I go
Don't fool me, oh no
I'm like a rolling thunder
Now the die is cast
Chances are vast
It won't be all the same

Hello world, here I am
Don't you fool me again
I'm like a blitz of lightning
The story's been told
And my blood runs cold
It won't be all the same

Hello world...
