HOT TONIGHT

We don't give a damn what they do for a living
Everywhere we go we party just the same

Getting all my fun
With crazy little girls like you
Playing all your games acting like a fool

Screaming - feel the fire
Screaming - feel the fire - feel it now now now

'cause we are hot tonight - hot tonight
'cause we are hot tonight - hot tonight

Must be time to go I'm feeling hot and sweaty
Find a place to go to make it hard'n'heavy

Wasting all this time
Would be a silly thing to do
Please don't be a tease now it's time me and you

Screaming - feel the fire
Screaming - feel the fire - feel it now now now

'cause we are hot tonight - hot tonight
'cause we are hot tonight - hot tonight

Screaming - feel the fire
Screaming - feel the fire - feel it now now now

'cause we are hot tonight - hot tonight.......
