BLACK HEART

Black is the colour - icy and cold
It is the power - forever wrong
All the burning inside - all the other rotten ways
Blinded minds - all the time - it happens all again

You know we all need some friends
To save this broken world
The freedom we will defend
Don’t need a devil - don’t need a devil inside

Black heart - dark mind
The seeds of evil will grow in time
Black heart - dark mind
Hail the devil and bless the crime

Over and over - the stories’ been told
Whole generations - have been sold
All the wrong directions - paid with innocence and fear
Danger times - twisted crimes - revenge is always near
Hail - hail,.....
