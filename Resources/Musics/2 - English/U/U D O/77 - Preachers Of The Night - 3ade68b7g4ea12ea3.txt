PREACHERS OF THE NIGHT

See the gates of hell and they're still bleeding
Creatures of the night are creeping out - so proud
I'll be there once more to feed them
More and more they're sneaking in my mind - so strong

All in all nothing's left behind
Cannot hold it back this dark desire
Don't turn your head or you'll be dead
The good have gone to ground - you know why

Preachers of the night - they're calling
Preachers of the night - there will be no tomorrow
Preachers of the night - I'm falling
Preachers of the night - they want me back

Touch the gates of hell while they're still bleeding
Tearing at my soul and watch it weep - so raw
You better back off
My mind is not my own take heed then
All evil's been unleashed within us all - so war!
You better back off

All in all nothing's left behind
Cannot hold it back this dark desire
Don't turn your head or you'll be dead
The good have gone to ground - you know why

Preachers of the night - they're calling
Preachers of the night - there will be no tomorrow
Preachers of the night - I'm falling
Preachers of the night - they want me back

Deal me out - I've had enough
Trading in the kingdom of te beast
Step by step - not far behind me
Flesh and blood will never rest in peace

All in all nothing's left behind
Cannot hold it back this dark desire
Don't turn your head or you'll be dead
The good have gone to ground - you know why

Preachers of the night - they're calling
Preachers of the night - there will be no tomorrow
Preachers of the night - I'm falling
Preachers of the night - they want me back

Preachers of the night - they're calling
Preachers of the night - there will be no tomorrow
Preachers of the night - I'm falling
Preachers of the night - they want me back
