DEAD MAN'S EYES

All along the walls the sunrise climbs
All around the world he’s in disguise
What is it we’ll find
When he’s in your mind
Come and take a look through dead man’s eyes

Heaven must have known the darkest knight
Memories of righteousness and light
Stand or we will fall
Whispers to the soul
Come and take a look through dead man’s eyes

What is it we’ll find
When he’s in your mind
Come and take a look through dead man’s eyes
Through dead man’s eyes

Desperate believers
Promising to free us
Now you look and see me
Now you have to heed me
Daggers drawn to bleeders
Led by ill deceivers
Now you have to feed me
Innocence and fury

Shadows crawl across the winter stone
Darkest nights will sting and steal your soul
What is it we’ll find
When he’s in your mind
Come and take a look through dead man’s eyes

Do you see his poisoned painted sky
When will you look up and realise
Stand or we will fall
Whispers to the soul
Come and take a look through dead man’s eyes
Through dead man’s eyes
