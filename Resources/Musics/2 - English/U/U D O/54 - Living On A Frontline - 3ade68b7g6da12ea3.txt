LIVING ON A FRONTLINE

Bad days are coming
Back into my head
They're looking for trouble, is that alright
You know you've seen them before

And now they're turning
Into the deepest nights
Shadows on the wall - don't surrender at all
You're not alone this time

Do or die - you'll always be on the run
Like a soldier in time - rain or shine
Aces high - you'd better be on the ball
Don't move outta the way - stand for what you've gotta say

We're living on a frontline
Always trying not to go
We're living on a frontline
It's much more than enough this time
We're living on a frontline

Now you start searching
For a better life
Better not look back - go straight ahead
Just be yourself all the time

Do or die - you'll always be on the run
Like a soldier in time - rain or shine
Aces high - you'd better be on the ball
Don't move outta the way - stand for what you've gotta say

We're living on a frontline
Always trying not to go
We're living on a frontline
It's much more than enough this time

We're living - living on a frontline
Always trying not to go
We're living on a frontline
It's much - it's much too much this time
Go ahead this time
Ah, we're living on a frontline

Ah, it's a bad game
I've told you before
So stay away from the frontline
And your friends next door

You say you're lonely
But I don't want them no more
But one day - you're gonna see
They're gonna disappear

We're living on a frontline
Always trying not to go
We're living on a frontline
It's much more than enough this time

We're living - living on the frontline
Always trying not to go
We're living on a frontline
It's much - it's much too much this time

On a frontline
