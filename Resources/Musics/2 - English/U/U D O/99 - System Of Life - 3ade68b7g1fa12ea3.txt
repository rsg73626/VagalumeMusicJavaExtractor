SYSTEM OF LIFE

Now it's time to look in your eyes
You're so much better it's no surprise
It's like a mirror is watching you
Maybe the word's been broken - don't be no fool

Following the lights you see like a rolling train
Yesterday is gone - tomorrow's in your hands
Something you've had is gone - don't wish it back
Let it go - don't run away - it's nothing you'll forget

You know the rules don't need no warning
There's only one way to find the clue
Inside you so let it go

System of life - be the hunted or the hunter
System of life
System of life - it's always by your side
System of life - the one and only way to live in harmony

Don't paint a picture full of love and hate
Paradise is here - but exceptions prove the rules
Sometimes it feels just like a dream becoming true
Close your eyes - look inside - it will never be the same

'Cause for your life there ain't no warning
So stand up and fight to find the clue
So watch out you live and learn

It's the
System of life - be the broken or the breaker
System of life
It's the
System of life - it's always real and true
System of life - the one and only way to live in harmony
Yeah - yeah

Oh, it's the
System of life - be the hunted or the hunter
System of life
It's the
System of life - it's always by your side
System of life - the one and only way to live in harmony

It's the
System of life - be the taken or the taker
System of life
It's the
System of life - it's always real and true
System of life
