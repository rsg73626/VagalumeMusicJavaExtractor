CRASH BANG CRASH

I’m not dead yet – dead yet
Gonna have a crash – bang – crash
I’m not dead yet – dead yet
Gonna have a crash – bang – crash

Crash – bang – crash
Crash – bang – crash
Crash – bang – it’s not over yet
Crash – bang – crash
Crash – bang – crash
Crash – bang – it’s not over yet

Alive and I’m still kicking
Alive and on the boil
Alive the bomb’s still ticking
I’m your rock and roll
Tonight is all for giving
Tonight is all for fun
Tonight is your beginning
My rocking’s never done

Don’t you feel assaulted
Don’t you feel alive
Don’t you wish your enemies
Are dead and not alive
Give in to the music
Give in to the soul
Shifting up the power
It’s all for rock and roll
