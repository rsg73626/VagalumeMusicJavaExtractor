FUTURE LAND

It's a nightmare leading out of the dark
Tears running out of my eyes
Wake up and bring the truth into your life
I can't stand it anymore

All those nightmares - endless despair
Walk away from this dream
Show me the way out of the darkness
Into a land of light

See the world with different eyes
There's something true in this life
And I start getting closer
You'd better not fall behind

Don't take me to tomorrow
Don't take me to the future land
Don't take me to tomorrow
Don't take me to the future land

And now I've had enough of this ride
Just let me out of this game
So many reasons to step out and pay
Everyday it's the same

No more hiding - deep inside me
The pictures start to be real
You'd better listen to your heartbeat again
I know I wanna be free

See the world with different eyes
There's something true in this life
And I start getting closer
You'd better not fall behind
Don't take me to tomorrow (oh, no)
Don't take me to the future land (no lying - anymore)
Don't take me to tomorrow(mmmh, I)
Don't wanna see the future land
Don't take me to tomorrow (into the land of light)

Don't take me to the future land
Don't trade your life for sorrow (reach out for the paradise)
Stop longing for the future land

So many feelings deep in your heart
Don't you believe in this dream
So don't hide them deep inside you
Let them out this time, yeah

Don't take me to tomorrow (no lying anymore)
Don't take me to the future land (oh no)
Don't take me to tomorrow (don't take me away)
Don't take me to the future land (without day or night)
Don't trade your life for sorrow (oh no)
Stop longing for the future land (for the land of light)

It's a nightmare leading out of the dark
Tears running out of my eyes
Wake up and bring the truth into your life
I can't stand it anymore

All those nightmares - endless despair
Walk away from this dream
Show me the way out of the darkness
Into a land of light

Don't take me to tomorrow
Don't take me to the future land
Don't take me to tomorrow
Don't wanna see the future land

Don't trade your life for sorrow...
