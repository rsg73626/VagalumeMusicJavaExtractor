BLACK AND WHITE

Eyes of fire – heart of ice
Angel dreams – devil's vice
Said the spider to the fly
One more move and you will die
Hard and mean – cold desire
You're the one to give me light
You don't even whet my appetite

Black and white – black and white
Black and white – black and white

Heaven sent – kiss and tell
Hallowed soul – gone to hell
What it takes i'll make you mine
Then you'll be broken for some time
Sacred throne – hard as stone
You're the one to give me light
You don't even whet my appetite

Black and white – black and white
Black and white – black and white

Nothing ventured nothing gained
Lose your soul
'cause you've been framed
You've got the devil in your eye
See the viper and you kiss good-bye

You're the one to give me light
You don't even whet my appetite

(2x)
Black and white – black and white
Black and white – black and white
