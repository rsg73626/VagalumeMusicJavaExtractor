WINTER IN JULY

I stay away, try not to call but
Something keeps drawing me in
Keep thinking back
To what we had
Will we ever have this time again
So many changes
It all feels so strange
So cold

I guess this is for real
That’s why it feels like I’m frozen
Winter in July
There’s no sun in the sky
Just like ice, I’m fallen and broken
Winter in July

I lie awake
Counting seconds
Off the clock to halt my tears
In this crowded room
I’m all alone
I watch the door like you were here
So many answers that I wanna know
I’m so torn

I guess this is for real
That’s why it feels like I’m frozen
Winter in July
There’s no sun in the sky
Just like ice, I’m fallen and broken
Winter in July

Hard to find the words to make it real
To express the way you make me feel
I could’ve sworn I said I didn’t need you
But now
I finally woken up I realise
I was really pushing you aside
And you know I’m not half as strong as I made out

I guess this is for real
That’s why it feels like I’m frozen
Winter in July
There’s no sun in the sky
Just like ice, I’m fallen and broken
Winter in July

I know this is for real
That’s why it feels like I’m frozen
Winter in July
