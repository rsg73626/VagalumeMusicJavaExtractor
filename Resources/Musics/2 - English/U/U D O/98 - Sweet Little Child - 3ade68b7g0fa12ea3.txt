SWEET LITTLE CHILD

Darkness- and yet another day slips away
So lonely- life's just like an empty room
Where is the answer, when our love was so sweet

I wish I could hold you tonight
But we only came close in my dreams

Sweet little child
Give me your answer
Some broken hearts
They'd die for that answer
To try to get back, back to the past to break free

Tell me how can I find your sunshine again
Truth is well- you know that better than me

I wish I could hold you tonight
But we only came close in my dreams

Sweet little child
Give me your answer
Some broken hearts
They'd die for that answer
To try to get back, back to the past to break free,

Sweet little child
Give me your answer
Some broken hearts
They'd die for that answer
To try to get back, back to the past to break free

SOLO

You know some broken hearts, would die for that answer

Sweet little child
Give me your answer
