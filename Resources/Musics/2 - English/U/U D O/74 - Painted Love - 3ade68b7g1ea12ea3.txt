PAINTED LOVE

She's been around, knows how to make you think
You're in a world of innocence
She'll make you moan- make you moan and groan
Then spit you out and eat your bones

She sits around and thinks about those lies
It really makes her wonder
Chasing history- her world of ecstasy
A life of rape and plunder

Welcome to the rooms of your desire
Painted Love- Painted Love
Take a ride and explore inside
Painted Love- Painted Love

She knows how to make you scream and shout
You know she loves to get it out
The fascination of a fuckin' lie
It's just a case of do or die

She sits around and thinks...

Welcome to the rooms of your desire
Painted Love- Painted Love
Reaching out- breaking out
Painted Love- Painted Love
Take a ride, explore inside
Painted Love- Painted Love
Reaching out- breaking out
Painted Love- Painted Love

SOLO

She sits around and thinks...

Welcome to the rooms....
