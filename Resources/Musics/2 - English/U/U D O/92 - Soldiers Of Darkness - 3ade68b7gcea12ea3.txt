SOLDIERS OF DARKNESS

These are the creatures- born to be wild
Nightmares and pictures of uncertain kind
Born again to kill- any luscious dream
Caught in a war- where they love you to be

In the darkest night- they taunt ya
Mean- in the way they haunt ya

Is that the fight you battle for
Everything is dark- pain is creeping up
Wake up chilled with fear- like never before
Tonight- tonight- gonna have to push for more

In the darkest night- they taunt ya
Mean- in the way they haunt ya

Hey you- take me higher- higher to the danger zone
To the danger zone

They love your sweat - they are collecting tears
You die- you cry- just a dream and nothing more
You cannot hide- you cannot fight
All you want is leave- leave this evil dream

In the darkest night- they taunt ya
Mean- in the way they haunt ya

Hey you- take me higher- higher to the danger zone
Hey you- take me higher- higher to the danger zone

But morning light will free you
Fears and tears are gone
Here they die- the darkness' soldiers- another war is won

These are the creatures- born to be wild
Nightmares and pictures of uncertain kind
Wake up chilled with fear- like never before
Tonight- tonight- gonna have to push for more

In the darkest night- they taunt ya
Mean- in the way they haunt ya

Hey you- take me higher- higher to the danger zone
Hey you- take me higher- higher to the danger zone

But morning light will free ya
Fears and tears are gone
Here they die- the darkness' soldiers- another war is won
