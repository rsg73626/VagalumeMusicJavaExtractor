THE HEALER

Can you feel the morning light
Wanna make the sunrise mine
Been wandering from dusk to dawn

So many sleepless nights
Can't seem to get it right
So many memories in my mind

How many years have gone
Where was I coming from
I need someone to take me home

Has love just passed me by
No tears no reasons why
For harmony I'd sell my soul

For - my aim is right and strong
The sign I've waited for
There's no more knives into my heart
Now - I know right from wrong
My rescue's just begun
I've turned and faced the midnight sun

In the book of the healer
In the time of the healer

Why is the world so blind
I asked it many times
The answer's here for all to see

Now the past is laid to rest
Resurrection - born again
I thank the healer for it all

For - my aim is right and strong
The sign I've waited for
There's no more knives into my heart
Now - I know right from wrong
My rescue's just begun
I've turned and faced the midnight sun

In the book of the healer
In the time of the healer

It's on you - take your chance
Try it once and you'll break free
Power's out - just reach beyond
The healer's there for you and me

In the book of the healer
In the time of the healer
