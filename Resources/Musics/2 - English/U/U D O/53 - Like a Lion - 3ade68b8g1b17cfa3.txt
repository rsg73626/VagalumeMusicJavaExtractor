LIKE A LION

I had a dream today - it’s telling me
It’s time to leave the older days
This life goes on for you and me
Gonna pay the price
No matter how - no matter what I do
So now I’ll decide

Just take me to a better world
The only way I know
Sometimes I think
That’s not enough

No matter how - I’m gonna die like a lion
I wanna cry - I wanna cry like a lion

I see the picture now - on different days
There is no need for other ways
No more a fool - I’ve got the tools
For the here and now
Another face - another fearless heart
To rise from the crowd
