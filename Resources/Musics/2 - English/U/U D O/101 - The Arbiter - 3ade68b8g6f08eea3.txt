THE ARBITER

We lie and cheat the game

Corruption’s everywhere

We try to buy our justice

Lies are hard to bear

When our days are over

Cross the great divide

The final day is coming

He knows wrong from right

Cut out the way it has been done

Just keep the fear inside

Nowhere to hide nowhere to run

Your life is on the line

Take the word of the arbiter

He always gets it right

Take the word of the arbiter

If it’s left or if it’s right

With him there’s no objection

You can’t have a deal

The word he says is final

Punishment’s for real

Talking – never moves

You hear it in your head

Body shaken terror

And he cuts you dead


Take the word of the arbiter

His word is always right

Take the word of the arbiter

Nothing left and nothing right


CHORUS
