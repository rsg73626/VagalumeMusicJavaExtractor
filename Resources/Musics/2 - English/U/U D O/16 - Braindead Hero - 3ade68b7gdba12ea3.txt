BRAINDEAD HERO

For a long time he's been lucky man
No difference if it's good or bad
The trigger's his - the orders others
No way to stop the final blow

The message: here ya go
The countdown's on a roll
War against the world
All systems deadly armed
Machine, man, all in one
They're all oblivious to the crime

Braindead hero
Braindead hero - out of the sun he comes
Braindead hero
Braindead hero - feel the blazing guns

Now we got to blow his circuitry
Drain the poison from his veins
Degenerate - corrupt his memories
Fire at will - just do or die

The message: here ya go
The countdown's on a roll
War against the world
All systems deadly armed
Machine, man, all in one
They're all oblivious to the crime

Braindead hero
Braindead hero -like a hammer from the sky
Braindead hero
Braindead hero - supersonic cry

You better stay just where you are
Consequences in the fire

Braindead hero
Braindead hero - out of the sun he comes
Braindead hero
Braindead hero - feel the blazing guns

Braindead hero
Braindead hero -like a hammer from the sky
Braindead hero
Braindead hero
