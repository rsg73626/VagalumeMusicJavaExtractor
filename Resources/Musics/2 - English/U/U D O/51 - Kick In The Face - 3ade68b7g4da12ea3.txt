KICK IN THE FACE

Sometimes it's not fair
Too many lies are told
Here we go- don't blame me
What are you lying for

Don't treat me like a toy
I have been through this pain
Long before- again and again
I believe that it's much too much

I only listen to my heart
It's never telling me a lie
I only listen to my heart

Like a kick in the face- sentimental lies
Like a kick in the face- sentimental lies

Don't you dare to hurt me
It's my life- and it's real
I'm not your fool
I will fight for my right

I only listen to my heart
It's never telling me a lie
I only listen to my heart

Like a kick in the face- sentimental lies
Like a kick in the face- sentimental lies
Like a kick in the face

Let's get right down to it
I hate the way you talk
I'm leaving all the bad times
I leave it all- all for you

I only listen to my heart
It's never telling me a lie
I only listen to my heart

It's like a kick in your face- sentimental lies
Like a kick in your face- sentimental lies

It's like a kick in your face- sentimental lies
Like a kick in your face- sentimental lies
