THE INSTIGATOR

Who would you have beside you on the rack
Who is the one who justifies attack
Who is the one who lights the evil spark
Who is the one who’s planning in the dark
Who is the one who stabs you in the back

He is the one who makes it all come true
He is the one who always lies to you
He is the one who always starts the wars
He is the one who finds the hidden clause
He is the one so heartless and so cruel

Don’t you care – he’s the perpertrator
Don’t you dare – stop the designator
Instigator – the menace knows no bounds
Instigator – always been around
Instigator – twisting right to wrong
Instigator – too late once it’s begun

Never let you destroyers heed the call
Never let you the dangerous touch your soul
Never the one to break the evil seal
Never give up your heart and lose the feel
Never turn face you’ll find yourself alone

Don’t you laugh – in the face of evil
Don’t get hooked – on the lies he deals you
Instigator – the menace knows no bounds
Instigator – always been around
Instigator – twisting right to wrong
Instigator – too late once it’s begun
