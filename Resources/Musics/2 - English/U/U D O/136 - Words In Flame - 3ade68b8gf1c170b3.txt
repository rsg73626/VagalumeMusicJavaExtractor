WORDS IN FLAME

From your lips the lying words are falling
Right or wrong I've heard it all before
Burns into my ears a deadly warning
Killing me, the sum of all the fears
Even on the dawn
Words are carved in stone
Impossible to take the word away
I can see your words in flame
They lie in the underworld
I can feel your words in flame
Inside they will die
Even I was tempted on the promise
Became the rat I lost my way before
Haunted in the years so many problems
Listen to me telling you the truth
Even on the dawn
Words are carved in stone
Impossible to take the word away
I can see your words in flame
They lie in the underworld
I can feel your words in flame
Inside they will die
Words a broken
Hope is gone
I feel I'm up against a wall
The door is open
Words are lost
I cannot win the fight alone
I see the light
It breaks the night
And leads me back where I belong
