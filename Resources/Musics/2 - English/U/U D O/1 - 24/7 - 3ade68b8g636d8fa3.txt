24/7

I'm gonna blow your mind
And push you higher
I have my way to find
And nail the liar

You want it cleaner, I make it meaner
Anyway you want
You're gonna squeeze, you're gonna please it
Always on the hunt

Come on and roll it
So fucking hold It.....move your ass
Come on and scream it
We fucking mean it...living fast

YOU KNOW WE LIVE IT
24/7
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
YOU KNOW WE GIVE IT
24/7
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK

I'm gonna kick you hard
You want disaster
We only take it rough
And tough and faster

You want it cleaner, I make it meaner
Right between the eyes
You're gonna queeze it, you're gonna please it
Always pay the price

Come on and roll it
So fucking hold It.....move your ass
Come on and scream it
We fucking mean it...living fast

YOU KNOW WE LIVE IT
24/7
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
YOU KNOW WE GIVE IT
24/7
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
