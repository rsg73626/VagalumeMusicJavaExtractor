BORN TO RUN

You're back to win
To start again
Searching for the power
That you've had before

The tables turned
Mistakes you've made
Stop telling lies - no angeleyes
Just look straight ahead

Don't be afraid to roll the dice
Open up your eyes
So hit the road and memorize
You're not for sale

You're born to run
So take it from the start
You know you're born to run
Don't lose your heart

Now you're calling the shots
So you'd better watch out
Don't you understand you can't deny
What you have done before

But don't you know
Your time will come
Forget the past - just head out
Head out for your aims

And in the end you'll see the light
Tearing up the night
So let it shine and realize
You're not for sale

You're born to run
So take it from the start
You know you're born to run
Don't waste your time and realize that you're
You're born to run
Tomorrow's here today
'Cause you're the number one
You're leading the way

So just believe me
You'd better watch out
Your time will come
Mark my words
Think about it
I wanna tell ya

You're born to run
So take it from the start
You know you're born to run
Don't waste your time and realize that you're
You're born to run
Tomorrow's here today
'Cause you're the number one
Fight the fight - light the light - realize you're
born to run
