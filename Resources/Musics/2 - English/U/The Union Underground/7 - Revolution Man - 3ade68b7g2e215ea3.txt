REVOLUTION MAN

Revolution Man

One more time and you'll be dead
At least I think that's what they said
Forty days won't break a man
It was a bullet in his head
There's something in the...
Something in the way you were
The pain so wrong my friend
Revolution...revolution man
Imagine all the people

One more time and you'll be dead
At least I think that's what they said
Forty days won't break a man
It was a bullet in his head

Listen while I load my gun
He said to me
Something 'bout a chosen one
It's comin' back to me
Watch him while I taste the sun
He said to me
Something 'bout a chosen one
You'll never be

One last time your medicine
Swallow hard and take it in
Lucy's in the sky again
Trippin' on her diamonds
