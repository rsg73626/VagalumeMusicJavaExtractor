SOUTH TEXAS DEATHRIDE

Take a look in my mind and justify
Hell, I might even sympathize
But why must you fuck with these things
In my head for so long that I feel I could break
Never forget your lies
Hypocrisize
Five million might change your mind
But why must you fuck with these things
In my head for so long that I feel I could break

So c'mon c'mon c'mon get up get up
South Texas deathride you motherfuck
So c'mon c'mon c'mon get up get up
South Texas man I'm livin' it up

So what if I was your guide
South Texas deathride
Like I said I might sympathize
But why must you fuck with these things I believe
Man it's guilt by association
