THE FRIEND SONG

The Friend Song

Living in fear fuck pretend
24 years struggle within
Makin' it clear this is sin
Lie my dear lie my friend

So sad

Livin' in me complicate
What's it gonna be so irate
Choke on me asphyxiate
All I see all my hate

So sad too bad

I'll be the one 
**** you for fun
This song is dumb

You said you were my friend
Hope you never call again

Comin' undone live with this 
Beautiful one state of bliss
My affliction's killing this
Bury this one for a kiss
