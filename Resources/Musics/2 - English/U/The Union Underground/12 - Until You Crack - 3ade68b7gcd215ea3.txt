UNTIL YOU CRACK

Until You Crack

Kiss your mother now I think you should
Kick you while you're down you knew I would

So I'm wearin' thin, same old trip again,
Face numb heroin, same old trip again
I said how long? Until you crack man

Drag your sister down you never learn
Teach your brother how and watch him burn
Feel you come I see your red flower loveliness,
Shoot the fun I feel your black hollow consciousness

I turned you on to what they call the fuckin' devil's son,
I kiss you all the feeble and the damage done,

Your paranoia is starting to bore ya'
The feeling is so that I'm sick and I'm breaking

Your paranoia is starting to bore ya'
My bleeding is for ya' so that I'm dead
