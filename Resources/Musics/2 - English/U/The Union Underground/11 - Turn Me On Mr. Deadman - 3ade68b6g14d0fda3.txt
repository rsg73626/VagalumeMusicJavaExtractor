TURN ME ON MR. DEADMAN

Penetrate, penetrate all the simple minds
They adore, what a bore how they stand in line
Dilate, dilate what's my drug of choice?
It's okay when they pay they say I got the voice
Look at this the motherfucker is a millionaire
Realise it's a mask that you wear
Violate, violate such a simple plan
Turn me on, turn me on Mr. Deadman

Yeah I want it
I need it
To make a million
Yeah I love it
A fuckin' rock star
Yeah I want it
I need it
To make a million
Yeah I love it
A fuckin' rock star

Realise it's a mask that you wear
