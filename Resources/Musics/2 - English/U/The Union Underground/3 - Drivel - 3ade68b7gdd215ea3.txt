DRIVEL

Drivel

Load up all your friends man I'm trippin' like a fuckhead
Bore us all again with your drivel kill the *** dead
Breathe in breathe out little fuck
Seething so like a motherfuck
Once again man your drivel killed the *** dead

Feel so down
So, that's alright

Come on over brother man we'll burn try my new juice
Maybe bring another I'll break out the new noose
There's something I missed
It's not on the list
Never learn I'm so in love with this
Once again man your drivel killed the *** dead

Feel so down
So very high
God where's your head
It gets you down
So, that's alright

Say that you never wanna get high man
There's nothin' better, give it a try man
Never learn I'm so in love with this
