OLD

It's been a long time
Uh Uh, Yeah Yeah Yeah, Come on, Yeah..
You know it's my life, 
My time, my rights, my rhymes, my grind, my struggle
Hustle, sweating in my blood too
A predator smells fear and I smell a lot
My competitor smells fear, I smoke I was hot

I want it all in excess, the sex, and much success, stress sucks
I want it all no less now come on!
