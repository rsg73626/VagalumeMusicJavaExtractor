REALLY

I couldn't really put it any better than this
The love that I feel, in your tender kiss.
And something about your body girl I can't resist
It don't get no better, no better than this.

You know I love you - with all my heart and soul
You put me in a spell - and you have total control.
The feeling that I have
You know I can't explain
But it's something that I want
Again and again and again

Stay with me forever
For me you are the one
Stay with me forever
The fun has just begun

I really couldn't put it any better than this
The loving that I'm feeling in your tender kiss
Somethin' 'bout your body that I can't resist
Gotta tell you honey, don't get better than this
I really couldn't tell you any better than this
The loving that you give me I won't contest
Wrap me up in loving that is simply the best
Gotta tell you baby you're the best in any test

The feeling that I have
You know I can't explain
But it's something that I want
Again and again and again

Stay with me forever
For me you are the one
Stay with me forever
The fun has just begun

So girl to me you know you are the sun and stars
Surely I would follow you, to Venus or Mars
Girl to me you know you make my whole world bright
'cause everything you do by me, you know is alright.
You know I love you - with all my heart and soul
You put me in a spell - and you got total control.

The feeling that I have
You know I can't explain
But it's something that I want
Again and again and again

Stay with me forever
For me you are the one
Stay with me forever
The fun has just begun
[Repeat 3x]
