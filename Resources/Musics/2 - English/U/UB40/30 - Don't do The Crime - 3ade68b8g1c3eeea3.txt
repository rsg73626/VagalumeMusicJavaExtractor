DON'T DO THE CRIME

Don't do the crime,
If you can`t do the time
It's said that it just don't pay.
But what good's working hard
When all they give you is your cards

And you know there's not much you can say.

So you take what they give
You've no money to live
And your family don't understand.
After all these years
They will end up in tears
With a mountain of bills in their hands.

Now your lesson is learned
There's nowhere to turn
And it's no use pleading for help.
When you're left on the heap
There is nothing to keep you
From going and helping yourself

The dilemma you've found
Is you`re morally bound
Now your moral code needs a review
So what do you care
You know life isn't fair
And for years they've been stealing from you.
