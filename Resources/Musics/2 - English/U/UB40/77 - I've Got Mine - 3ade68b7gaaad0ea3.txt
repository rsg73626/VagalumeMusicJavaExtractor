I'VE GOT MINE

I can take the pressure here  
I don't walk the streets in fear  
I'm taller than I was last year  
'cause I've got mine  
What ya want? I've got mine!  
What ya want? I've got mine!  

No-one is gonna take from me  
Frame me or my family  
'cause if they do it's plain to see  
that they'll get waste  

What ya want? I've got mine!  
What ya want? I've got mine!  

So if you want the same as me  
a feeling of security  
Then I've got something you should see  
You can get one  

What ya want? I've got mine!  
What ya want? I've got mine!  

What ya want? I've got mine!  

(repeat 'till end)
