SWEET CHERRIE

I`ve got to find sweet cherry 
She`s gone away from home 
I`ve got to find sweet cherry 
She`s left me all alone 
  
(Chorus) 

Cherry, Cherry, 
Don`t go and leave me alone 
Don`t go and leave me alone 
  

My thoughts are always with you 
The emptiness leaves me blue 
If you should ever desert me 
Then life deserts me too 
  

(Chorus) 

Cherry, Cherry, 
Don`t go and leave me alone 
Don`t go and leave me alone 
  

When we were together, downtown  
We would do things together, downtown 
The first place I met you, downtown 
There we could always be. 
  

(Chorus) 

Cherry, Cherry, 
Don`t go and leave me alone 
Don`t go and leave me alone
