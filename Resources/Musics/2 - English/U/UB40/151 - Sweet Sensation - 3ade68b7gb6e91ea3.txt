SWEET SENSATION

I can feel those thrill`s walking over  
When you hold me tight  
Now I feel those pains aching over  
When you say goodnight  
  
(Chorus)  

Oh what sweet sensation  
Lord what strange devotion  
You`ve got love and devotion  
And I won`t forget your charm  
  

Now there`s nothing left for me to say girl  
But stay in your world  
You`ve got so much soul deep inside girl  
And love that's richer than gold  

(Chorus to fade)
