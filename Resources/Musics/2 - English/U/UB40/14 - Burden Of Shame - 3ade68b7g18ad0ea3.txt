BURDEN OF SHAME

There are murders that we must account for  
Bloody deeds have been done in my name  
Criminal acts we must pay for  
And our children will shoulder the blame  
  
(Chorus)  

I`m a British subject, not proud of it  
While I carry the burden of shame (Repeat)  
  

As a nation we`re following blindly  
No-one stops to question why  
Our money`s supporting an army  
And a boy in Soweto dies  
  

(Chorus)  

I`m a British subject, not proud of it  
While I carry the burden of shame (Repeat)  

Must we go on ignoring forever  
The cries of an African son  
There`s a soldier`s hand on the trigger  
But it`s we who are pointing the gun  
  

(Chorus)  

I`m a British subject, not proud of it  
While I carry the burden of shame (Repeat)
