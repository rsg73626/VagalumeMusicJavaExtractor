SOMEONE LIKE YOU

There must be some place we can go
There must be someone that you know
Where can I go, and who you know worries me,
oh Lord
Where can I find someone like you, to love
Where can I find someone like you, my love
There must be something we can try
There must be some things we can find
What can I try, and how to get by worries me,
oh Lord
Where can I find someone like you, to love
