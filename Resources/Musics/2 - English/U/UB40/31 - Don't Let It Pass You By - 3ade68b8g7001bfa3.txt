DON'T LET IT PASS YOU BY

There's no-one coming with that freedom train
There's nowhere you can go where you feel no pain
Take the blinkers off you eye's
The power is in your hand
Stop waiting for your ticket to the promised land

Don't let it pass you by, don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by

There ain't no heaven and there ain't no hell (Don't let it pass you by)
Except the one we're in and you know to well (Don't let it pass you by)
There's no-one waiting on, waiting on a higher high
Don't let the only world you're ever gonna live in pass you by

Don't let it pass you by, don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by

There ain't no heaven and there ain't no hell (Don't let it pass you by)
Except the one we're in and you know to well (Don't let it pass you by)
There's no-one waiting on, waiting on a higher high
Don't let the only world you're ever gonna live in pass you by

Don't let it pass you by, don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by, don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by

Rub two dub burn ital collie
Because the rhythm a the Marshall
And the rhythm a no partial go deh
Seh the rhythm a the Marshall
And the rhythm a no partial
Rub two dub burn ital collie
Burn two spliff play ital riddem
Because you jamming with you brethren
Jam it 'till a morning
Forget â€˜bout the warning
You have to jam it 'till a mornin'
Burn two spliff play ital riddem
Burn two spliff play ital riddem
Seh you playing in a concrete style
You playing in an other duck style
You playing in a resident style
And then you jam it all the while
Don't let it pass you by
You gonna wake up and wonder why
Gone in the blues
Go check on the news
Go listen to political views
Rub two dub burn ital collie
Rub two dub burn ital collie

New Cross was no gate-crash bomb
Rightful justice must be done
Burn two spliff and rock to the riddem
Burn two spliff and rock to the riddem
We don't deal with Isim Scisim

Deal with folly-dolly

Burn two spliff play ital riddem
Rub two dub burn ital collie
Because the rhythm a the Marshall
And the rhythm a no partial
Because you jammin' with your brethren
Jam it 'till the morning
Playin' in a concrete style
Dub the dub all the while
Ram it in a resident style
Jam it all the while
Don't let it pass you by
You gonna wake up and wonder why
