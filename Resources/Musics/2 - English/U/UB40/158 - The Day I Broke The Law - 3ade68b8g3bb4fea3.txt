THE DAY I BROKE THE LAW

Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I hope to find you all alone
With open arms to greet me at the door.
You cried as I was led away
It seems like only yesterday
But after all these years I can't be sure

[Chorus:]
While I've been dreaming dreams of you
Not knowing what your going through
I prayed that you'd remember me
But I know life goes on you see
I broke your heart the day I broke the law

The man you know don't hurt no more
My tears were shed behind locked door
I've told myself your gone ten thousand times.
Still when it got to much too bear
I'd run my fingers through your hair
Your kissing lips were always on my mind.

[Chorus]

So yesterday they set me free
They gave me back my liberty
They gave me something else I can't ignore,
The chance to go back where I'm from
The chance to even call upon
My friends but they don't live here anymore...

[Chorus]
