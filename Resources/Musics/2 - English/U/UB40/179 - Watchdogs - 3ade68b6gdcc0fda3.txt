WATCHDOGS

You try to close your ears
And you try to close your eyes
But the blasphemies keep coming
And tempting you with lies

Chorus:
Give thanks for your protection
Your watchdogs of the night
Who hold the hungry wolves at bay
And keep them out of sight out of sight

You focus your direction

Cloak tightly pulled around
But somewhere in the distance
You can hear a haunting sound

Chorus 2x

You're in danger of corruption
And you're always running scared
You cannot make decisions
You're completely unprepared

Chorus
