RAT IN MI KITCHEN

(Chorus)  
There`s a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna do?  
There`s a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna go?  
I`m gonna fix that rat thats what I`m gonna do,  
I`m gonna fix that rat.  
  

When you open your mouth you don`t talk, you shout  
And you give every body the blame,  
But when they catch you up,  
They will shut you up  
And you got no one to blame  
  

(Chorus)  

There`s a rat in me kitchen ........  
  

When you out on the street,  
You practice lies and deceipt  
And you scandalize my name  
But when I catch you up  
I`m gonna pull you up  
I`m gonna check-out inside your brain  
  

(Chorus)   
There`s a rat in me kitchen .......  
  

when yo deh pon the scene,  
You make everyone scream  
Because they know your so unjust  
But when they catch you up  
They will kick you up  
Because you someone they cannot trust  
  

(Chorus)  

There`s a rat in me kitchen .......  
  

You invade my space  
Make me feel disgraced  
And you just don`t give a damn  
If I had my way  
If I had my say  
I`d like to see you hang  
  

(Chorus)  

There`s a rat in me kitchen .....  

(Repeat chorus and fade)
