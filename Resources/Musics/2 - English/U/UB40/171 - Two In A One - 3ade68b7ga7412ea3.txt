TWO IN A ONE

(Chorus)  
Intellgent we chat intellgent

Jackpot is when you win plenty at money  
Jail is a place I don`t want to go  
January the first month of the year  
Jealose is when five women fancy  
But John is the proper name fe a English man  
Jockey is a profisnel horse rider  
Me sah June is the sixth mounth of the year  
  

(Chorus)  
  

An jam is when you caint move in a party  
Mi say England is a place that covered in snow  
Man we drink the ribeana wi don`t no like drink beer  
But Jelly fish Jahman mi say them swim in a the sea  
Unless you born an bread as a Jamican  
The pirate them a gather round the Jolly Roger  
Wi wackad as single but wi deadly as a pair  
  

(Chorus)  
  

No fe treatment go a hospital  
I man pay de rent every Tuesday I man  
You a Student if you a go to college  
Dat a nuff argoument mi say gunny an Pablo  
  

Cause a two in a one Jab man a two in a one  
Two in a one Jab man a two in a one  
Two in a one Jab man a two in a one  
Two in a one Jab man a two in a one

When you come a fiwi dance  
But a Babylon picl mi up  
And a think to myself  
Cause I`m going to jail  
Man is what a going to tell me girl Jab know I man was  
So I had to get reckless  
Because a two in a one Jab

Seh daddy Pablo a long with Gunslinger  
Seh duw to the Circumstances pirate setah in the area  
Listen to the style an when we throw down  
Because a murder it name  
Intelligent we chat intelligent
