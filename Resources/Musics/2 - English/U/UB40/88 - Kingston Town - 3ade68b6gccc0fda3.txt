KINGSTON TOWN

The night seems to fade, but the moonlight lingers on.
There are wonders for everyone.
The stars shine so bright,
but they're fading after dawn.
There's magic in Kingston Town.

Oh Kingston Town, the place I long to be.
If I had the whole world I would give it away
just to see the girls at play.

When I am king surely I would need a queen.
And a palace and everything, yeah.
And now, I am king and my queen will come at dawn
she'll be waiting in Kingston Town.

(repeat last two refrains till end)
