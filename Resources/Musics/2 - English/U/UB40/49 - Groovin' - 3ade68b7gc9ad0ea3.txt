GROOVIN'

I get my kicks from watching people  
Running too and from  
And if you ask them where they`re going  
Half of they don`t know  
They`re the ones who think I`m crazy  
But they don`t realize  
  
(Chorus)  

That I`m just groovin,oh! groovin  
Grooving out on life  
I`m just groovin ooh grovin  
Grovin till I die  
  

I see a river flowing by me   
Heading for the sea  
I get a feeling deep inside me  
It`s so good to be free  
I`ve got sunshine in the daytime  
And moonlight every night  
And I`m just groovin ......  
  

(Middle Eight)  
  

I see a river flowing by me   
Heading for the sea  
I get a feeling deep inside me  
It`s so good to be free  
I`ve got sunshine in the daytime  
And moonlight every night  
And I`m just groovin ......  
  

(Chorus)  

That I`m just groovin, groovin  
Grooving out on life  
I`m just groovin ooh grovin  
Grovin till I die
