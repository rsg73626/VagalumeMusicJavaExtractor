SHE CAUGHT THE TRAIN

Music : Bob Friday
Lyrics : Bob Friday

(Chorus)
Version Girl, what`s your name?
Oh you come and you go,
Version Girl, what`s your name?
Just like the morning sun.
It`s so hard to find a personality with charms
like yours for me.
oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee
Version girl, what`s your name?
Don`t you know I long to say.
Version Girl, what`s your name?
It`s so hard to find a personality
with charms like yours for me
oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along
So my heart will be satisfied
So please let me be your number one
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.

(Chorus)
Version girl, whats`s you name?
Oh you come ......etc
oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee

(Talking)
Version girl, whats`s you name?
Oh you come .......
oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee

I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along
So my heart will be satisfied
So please let me be your number one
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.
