ONE WOMAN MAN

I'm a one woman man after all these years
I've sailed with the tide on a sea of tears
Any port in a storm, I'd make my home
Any arms that were warm, when I was alone

CHORUS
When the moon was high, I would drift away
Into the night, until another day
When the sun comes up, I just wanna see
The woman that I love, lying next to me

I'm a one woman man I've got to say
You know that it hasn't always been this way
But that's all changed, I can say at last
I've waved goodbye to my chequered past

CHORUS

I'm a one woman man & that's no lie
I've got no use for no alibi
Ain't got no time, cause time can fly
And when I'm not with her, then I can't get high

CHORUS
