AFTER TONIGHT

I'm your key to set you free
You can come to me anytime for cover
Don't play shy, let me try
It's you I really want & not another.

CHORUS
Baby, don't you fight
Or get your little self uptight, you know
Baby after tonight.

You're alive but they could die
Won't you swim to me a little bit closer
I can read what you mean
It's you oh baby you, I'm looking after

CHORUS

Baby, baby I said, I need your love
Baby, baby you're the one I'm dreaming of
Baby, baby I said, I need your love
Baby, baby you're the one I'm dreaming of

CHORUS
