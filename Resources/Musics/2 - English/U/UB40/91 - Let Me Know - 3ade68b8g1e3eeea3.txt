LET ME KNOW

[Chorus:]
Let me know, what I got to do
Make it so, I can get it through to you
Blow by blow accounts in black and blue
Make it so, let it go, make it so...

Any other time we would welcome you
Right now there's something else we got to do
We commiserate but were running late
Hurry up and wait.

[Chorus]

Have we met before, can't remember you
Now tell us what it is you wanted us to do
Book a future date to negotiate
Hurry up and wait.

[Chorus]

The problem is fundamentally
Over the horizon where we can't see
We can't relate so we segregate
Hurry up and wait.

[Chorus]
