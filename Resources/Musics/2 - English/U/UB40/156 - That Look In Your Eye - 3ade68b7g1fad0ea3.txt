THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE

(Ali)  
Show me a girl peace and harmony in her heart  
When things go wrong there will be no falling apart  
One who understands  
That things aren't always gonna go right and  
I'll show you a man who can show you the light  
   
(Pamela)  
Show me a boy when the burden's on his shoulders  
As time goes on seems to only make him bolder  
Then I met you  
Something that I can't explain  
This feeling that I get is like I'm going insane  
   

It's that look in your eyes that say you love me  
And all the silly things that you do  
Those feelings I get from the stars above me  
Tells me you're for me  
And I'm the one for you  
   

Hey I thank you baby  
I thank you baby  
I thank you  
   

(Ali)  
Show me a girl that can me feel better  
With a kiss sealed inside a perfumed letter  
One who understands  
When the tour is six months long  
And waiting with open arms 'cos it's been too long  
   

(Pamela)  
Show me a boy whose loving that I'm missing  
Who can be there when I need someone to listen  
One who keeps in mind that I should never be alone  
Because I'll be there even if it's by telephone  
   

It's that look in your eyes that say you love me  
And all the silly things that you do  
Those feelings I get when ever you're near me  
Tells me you're for me  
And I'm the one for you  
   

Yeah I thank you baby  
I thank you baby  
Yeah I thank you baby  
Yeah I thank you baby  
I thank you
