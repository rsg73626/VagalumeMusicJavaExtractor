WALK ON ME LAND

[Chorus:]
Tell me somethin'
How come you walk on me land so?
How come you walk on me land so?
And tell me that it's yours

[Chorus]

For you to use as you see fit
So me and mine are forced to quit
And watch you devastating it
And tell me it belongs to you
You have the right, and I am wrong
You call the tune, I sing your song
And where I live, I don't belong
You tell me it belongs to you

[Chorus]

You have the right, and I am wrong
You call the tune, I sing your song
And where I live, I won't be long
You tell me it belongs to you
You get the riches, I have none
I do your work, you have the fun
I breathe your air, you block my sun
And tell me it belongs to you

[Chorus]
