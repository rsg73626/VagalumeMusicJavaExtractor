COVER UP

[Chorus:]
Cover up
With loving protection
Guard your love
In every direction
Don't give up
For fear of rejection
Stand your ground and voice an objection

[Verse 1:]
Run away my sister and brother
Be afraid of love when the lover
Tries to read the book by the cover
Wrapped up in the arms of another

[Chorus]

Cover up prolonging the yearning
Just ahead the fires are burning
Swim for shore the tides are now turning
Love the ones you love with your learning

[Chorus]

Look ahead the futures depending
On the brave to now start defending
Tell the world the message you're sending
We don't need an unhappy ending

[Chorus]

Got to be safe if you want to be free
To sit in the shade of the family tree

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

Got to be safe if you want to be free
To sit in the shade of the family tree
