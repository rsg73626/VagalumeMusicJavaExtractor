TELL IT LIKE IT IS

(Chorus)  
I jus` a tell it like it is, yeah  
I jus` a tell it like it is, oh yeah  
I`ve got to be blatant in this time  
Jus` like I know 1 + 1 no make 9 (Repeat)  
  

Now what was I saying about being blatant  
You got to be blatant in an argument  
You got to make sure your feelings are felt  
Perfect example for you from me  
Watch lying politicians me seh on me T.V.  
Pay big big money for the licence fee  
(At the same time them a try fi fool we) (Repeat)  
  

(Chorus)  

I jus` tell it like it is, yeah  
I jus` tell it like it is, oh yeah  
I`ve got ....  
  
  

I`ve got to be blatant in this time  
Now let me tell me more about being blantant  
You got to be blatant me seh  
With product you invent  
If you don`t patent it  
You nah see a cent  
You have no money fi go pay up your rent  
If you crash fi your car  
Or you in an accident  
If it`s not your fault you be blatant  
  

(Chorus)  

I jus` tell it like it is, yeah  
I jus` tell it like it is, oh yeah  
I`ve got ....  
  

Now I get serious about being blatant  
Police come and mess with me pon the pavement  
They say oi` where you going, what you doing here?  
I just leave mi house fi go buy a tin of beer  
Another example of being blatant  
South Africa police a kill the innocent  
Fire live ammunition me seh into a crowd  
If that`s not blatant murder  
Then murder can`t be found (Repeat)
