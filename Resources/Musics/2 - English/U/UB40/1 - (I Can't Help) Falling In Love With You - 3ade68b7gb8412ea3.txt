(I CAN'T HELP) FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU

Wise men say - Only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Repeat

Shall I stay - Would it be a sin,
If I can't help falling in love with you.

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand - Take my whole life too,
For I can't help falling in love with you.
