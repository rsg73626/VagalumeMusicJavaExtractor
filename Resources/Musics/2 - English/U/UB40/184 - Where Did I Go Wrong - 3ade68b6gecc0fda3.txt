WHERE DID I GO WRONG

I'm sitting here praying that you weren't just saying
Leaving tomorrow was what you had planned
No point in pretending I know that it's ending
I just wanna know where the ending began

Chorus:
Where did I go wrong to make it like this
No warmth in your body no touch in your kiss
Holding you now hurts more than it should
If I let you go girl you'll be gone for good

I thought you had saved me the love that you gave me
The sweetest loving in all of the land
But you've taken my heart and you've torn it apart
And it's crumbled to dust in the palm of your hand

Chorus

There's nothing worth saying I know you're not staying
Might as well face it it's out of my hands
No point in pretending I know that it's ending
I just wanna know where the ending began

Repeat chorus four times

(Where did I go where did I go where did I go wrong)
(Where did I go where did I go wrong)
