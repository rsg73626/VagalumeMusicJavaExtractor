HAPPINESS

I was born with so much love I burst each time the sun rises  
I reserved the hurt I feel to make happy suprises  
In my heaven here on earth I found my paradise  
All the laughter in my heart I credit to your smile  
Happiness is seeing all the stars in your eyes  
Happiness is knowing you are loved  
I berode the fears I had and sorted them all out  
Took a love offered me and pushed away the dark  
In my heaven here on earth I found my paradise  
What a satisfying feeling reaching for the skies  
Happiness is seeing all the stars in your eyes  
Happiness is knowing you are loved  

(INSTRUMENTAL BREAK)  

Oh oh oh, in my heaven here on earth I found my paradise  
What a satisfying feeling reaching for the skies  
Happiness is seeing all the stars in your eyes  
Happiness is knowing you are loved  

I berode the fears I had and sorted them all out  
Took a love offered me and pushed away the dark  
In my heaven here on earth I found my paradise  
What a satisfying feeling reaching for the skies  
Happiness is seeing all the stars in your eyes  
My happiness is knowing you are loved
