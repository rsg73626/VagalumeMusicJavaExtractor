CAUSE IT ISN'T TRUE

If I spoke in words you didn't understand  
Wouldn't that make me a better man  
Elocution class to lend a hand  
Get me a self-improvement plan  
  
(Chorus)  

I don't know, it seems to me  
Things I do best come easily  
I don't feel the need to say to you  
I'm better cause it isn't true  
  

Exquisite verse to higher the tone  
Performed in phrases not my own  
To hide the truth to I'll tell a lie  
With pictures from another`s eye  

(Chorus)  
  

I don't know, it seems to me  
Things I do best........(Etc)  
  

If I sport the latest cut of cloth  
Would you all assume I'd got some style  
And wear my hair just long enough  
To turn the heads of fashion for a while  
  

A sports car sexy, slimline, fast  
Quick enough to hide my past  
Rich enough to open doors  
I never could unlock before  
  

(Chorus)  

I don't know, it seems to me  
Things I do best........(Etc)
