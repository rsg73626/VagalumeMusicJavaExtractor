DANCING QUEEN

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of
Your life
Ohhh, see that girl, watch that scene, dig in the
Dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the
Swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

Chorus:

You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only
Seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh yeah! you can dance, you can jive, having the
Time of your life
Ohhh! see that girl, watch that scene, dig in the
Dancing queen

Dancing queen...ohh yeah

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

(repeat chorus)
