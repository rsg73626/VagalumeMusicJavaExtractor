BLING BLING

CHORUS
Bling,bling...yeah..aweh mi simting,
Bling,bling...emerald cut ring
Bling,bling...yeah..aweh mi simting,
Bling,bling chapparit and ting

Fifty men dead for this golden chain
Each link forged by a poor man's pain
mined from below with sweat & fear
Brought to a shine with a widow's tear

CHORUS

Fifty men dead for this diamond ring
dat takes the shine off the cheap bling thing
Kind a mek you think it no bonafide
Fi wear souvenirs from the men that died

CHORUS

If you really love me then don't buy me a ring
Diamonds & pearls they don't mean anything
All that I want is already here
Sitting by my side, you got nothing to fear

CHORUS

Fifty men dead for this golden band
Underground with a pick in their hand
Cutting dirt where the sun nuh shine
Digging to survive in the man's goldmine

How many dead for this royal crown
This holy shrine we gather round
Worship the dollar, pon your hands & knee
Humbled in the presence of your jewellery

CHORUS

If you really love me then don't buy me a ring
Diamonds & pearls they don't mean anything
All that I want is already here
Sitting by my side, you got nothing to fear

CHORUS
