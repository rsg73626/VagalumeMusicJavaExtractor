SARDONICUS

A human statue made of living stone  
A paradox etched in human bone  
If you could look behind his thin disguise  
There`s a hidden glint of madness in his eyes.  
  
Many men are fooled by his smile  
His superficial grace his charm his style  
Sardonicus is everybody`s Friend  
Sardonicus keeps smiling to the end.
