WALKED IN THE RAIN

I've been away
High on a breeze
Tasted the salt of the seven blue seas
Washed upon shores
Sun in my eyes
Stayed long enough just to say my goodbyes...

I walked in the rain
Wet me through and through
Following rainbows that lead me back to you
I've always believed
In what I've been told
Where rainbows end there's a pot of gold...

I'll read the stars
Talk to the moon
Stop when I hear somebody playing our tune
Any excuse
And you'll see me
Drifting back home to the place I should be...

Some people say
Listen to me
Mostly I find that I disagree
They tell me to change
Set myself free
I'm not convinced I don't want to be me

Maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll go
Maybe I'll stick around I don't know
One thing for sure
This I can say
I'm coming back; I've been so far away
