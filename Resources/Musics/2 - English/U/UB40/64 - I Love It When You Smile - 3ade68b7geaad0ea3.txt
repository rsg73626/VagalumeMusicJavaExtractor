I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SMILE

Chorus  
I love it when you smile  
When you're with me honey  
It happens all the while  
How it kills me when you cry  
And you know my heart  
That's no word of a lie  

Verse One  

Everyday you show me something new about you  
Honestly I could never live without you  
Look at me here's a soul who'll never doubt you  
And I will be forever by your side  

Repeat Chorus  

Verse Two  

Probably the greatest feeling I have ever known  
Actually is when you wrap yourself around me  
Promise me you'll stay now that I've found you  
And I will be forever by your side  

Repeat Chorus  

Verse Three  

And you could say you've heard it all before  
And I know that anyday you may walk out the door  
When I say no one will love you more believe me  
And I will be forever by your side  

Repeat Chorus
