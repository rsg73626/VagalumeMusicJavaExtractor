THE TIME HAS COME

There is no time to sit around and wait
Don't you know the world, it is of love and of hate
Now is the time, we've got to be strong
We can't go wrong
Because the time has come, the time has come
To be free can't you see
Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo
Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo
Don't you know the cheating, the killing, backbiting it cannot help
Cos' can't you see them problems, it's everyday
They've got to solve themselves
Cos' now is the time, we gotta be strong
We can't go wrong
Because the time has come, the time has come
To be free can't you see
Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo
Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo
There is no time to sit around and wait
Don't you know the world, it is of love and of hate
Cos now is the time, we've got to be strong
We can't go wrong
Because the time has come, the time has come
