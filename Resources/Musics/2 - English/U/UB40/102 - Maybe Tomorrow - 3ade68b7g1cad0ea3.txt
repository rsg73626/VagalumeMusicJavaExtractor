MAYBE TOMORROW

I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STARS THERE ARE 
UP IN THE HEAVENLY SKY 
I ONLY KNOW MY HEAVEN IS HERE ON EARTH 
EACH TIME YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES 
YOU'RE ALL I NEED TO GET BY 
NO-ONE ELSE CAN MAKE ME CRY 
THE WAY YOU DO BABY 
MY BEAUTIFUL BIRD YOU HAVE FLOWN AWAY 
I HELD YOU TO TIGHT I CAN SEE 
YOU'RE ALL I NEED TO GET BY 
NO-ONE ELSE CAN MAKE ME CRY 
THE WAY YOU DO BABY 

(instrumental) 

YOU ARE THE BOOK THAT I'M READING BABE 
YOU ARE THE SONG THAT I SING 
YOU ARE THE FOUR SEASONS OF MY LIFE 
BUT MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND GIRL 
MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL COME BACK TO MY ARMS GIRL
YOU'RE ALL I NEED TO GET BY 
NO-ONE ELSE CAN MAKE ME CRY 
THE WAY YOU DO BABY 

YOU ARE THE BOOK THAT I'M READING BABE 
YOU ARE THE SONG THAT I SING 
YOU ARE THE FOUR SEASONS OF MY LIFE 
BUT MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND GIRL 
MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL COME BACK TO MY ARMS GIRL
MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND GIRL 
MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL COME BACK TO MY ARMS GIRL
