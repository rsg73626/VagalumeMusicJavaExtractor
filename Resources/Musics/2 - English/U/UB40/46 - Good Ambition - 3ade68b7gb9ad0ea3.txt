GOOD AMBITION

I've spent eleven months and five days loving you
And all these times I've spent forgiving you
I don't want to be hurt 
I don't want to be hurt
I don't want to be hurt
Not any more
I'm a man with a good ambition
And I will never let you drag me down
You better go home and leave me alone
I'm a man with a good ambition
And I will never let you drag me down
So baby go home
And leave me alone
I've got a good, good, good ambition
Tell you it's a good, good, good ambition
I've got a good, good, good ambition
Tell you it's a good, good, good ambition
I've got a good, good, good ambition
