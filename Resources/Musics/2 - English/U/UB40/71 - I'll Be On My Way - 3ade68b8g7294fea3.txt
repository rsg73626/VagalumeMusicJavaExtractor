I'LL BE ON MY WAY

The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss & I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way I will go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way I will go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way.
