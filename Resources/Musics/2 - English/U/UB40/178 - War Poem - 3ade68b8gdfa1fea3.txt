WAR POEM

Silence falls in no man's land
To echo on uncertain steps
Sharp of eye & quick of hand
Advancing forward to regrets
Underfoot the bombs & mortars
Sleep awaiting coded warnings
From the top the barking orders
Light the sky on these dark mornings

CHORUS
Seek asylum from the terror
Reaching out for what it's worth
Shelter from the raging anger
Raining down on bitter earth

Sympathy for all who's hurting
Getting lost between the lines
It's the stuff that keeps returning
Laughing loud in victor's lies
Up above on wind's declaring
Soon the cold will whistle through
Push aside the warm sierras
Fill the sails that carry you

CHORUS

Many miles are put between the
What once was & what will be
Sleepwalk nightmare to sweet dream
Each step consigned to history
Every whisper sings resistance
All emotions hide inside
Refugee looks to the distance
Out there somewhere lies his pride

CHORUS
