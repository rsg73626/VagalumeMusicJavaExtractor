I WANT TO MAKE YOU SWEAT

I've been watching you

C'mon!

Hey!

Standing across the room
I saw you smile
Said I want to talk to you-oo-oo
For a little while
But before I make my move
My emotions start running wild
My tongue gets tied
And that's no lie

Looking in your eye
Looking in your big brown eye
Ooh yeah
And I've got this to say to you
Hey!

Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out
I'm gonna push it some, mo-o-ore
Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out
I'm gonna push it
Push it, push it some more

C'mon!

Ooh

So I said to myself
"Does she love me or not?"

But the dreads done know
That love is his to get
With a little bit of this
And a little bit of that
the lyrics goes on the attack
My tongue gets tied
And that's no lie

Looking in your eye
Looking in your big brown eye
Ooh girl
And I've got this to say to you
Hey!

Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out
I'm gonna push it some mo-o-ore
Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out
I'm gonna push it
Push it, push it some more

Ooh yeah!

One more time!

Sing it!

Hey!

Woo woo woo woo wee yeah

I'm looking in your big brown eye
Ooh Yeah
And I've got this to say to you
Hey!

Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out
I'm gonna push it some mo-o-ore
Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out
I'm gonna push it
Push it, push it some more

Yeah!

Push it, push it some more

Alright!

Push it, push it some more
