I THINK IT'S GOING TO RAIN TODAY

Lonely, Lonely,
Tin can at my feet.
Think I'll kick it down the street,
That's the way to treat a friend

Broken windows and empty hall ways
Pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away.
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today.

Right before me, the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
