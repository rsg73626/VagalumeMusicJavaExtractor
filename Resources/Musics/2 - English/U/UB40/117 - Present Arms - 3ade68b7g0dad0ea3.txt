PRESENT ARMS

You got no job you got no pay  
Join the military, sign today  
They`ll take you off to fight on foreign shores  
  
You`ll be your mother`s pride and joy  
Her armed and dangerous golden boy  
A uniformed hero that shows no fear  
  

The khaki ranks of flesh and steel  
Learning how to smile and kill  
They`ll teach you to ignore the screams and tears
