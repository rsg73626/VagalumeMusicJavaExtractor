HIT IT

1st Verse   
Somebody said what are you doin' down there   
Trying to make me a living   
All I want is to get my fair share   
I'm pleading but nobody's giving   
Maybe I'm wrong, and I don't see things clear   
But I know how I feel after all the these years   
I'll keep fighting the pain and the heartache and tears   
  

Chorus   

Then I'll push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
I'm going to push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
Push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
I'm going to push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
  

2nd Verse   

Looking up cause I've got time to spare   
Today the sun ain't shining   
I'm still searching everywhere   
For my cloud with the silver lining   
People say that enough is enough   
Turn my back on this thing put it down to bad luck   
But the day I do that, then my life will be up   
  

Chorus   

So I'll push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
I'm going to push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
Push it, going to work it   
Keep right on till I hit it   
I'm going to push it, going to work it  
Keep right on till I hit it
