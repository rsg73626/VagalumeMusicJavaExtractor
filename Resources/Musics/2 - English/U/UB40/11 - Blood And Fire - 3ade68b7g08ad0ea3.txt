Rasta Hail!
Blessed is the weed, the healing of all nations in every corner of the earth
Blessed are the fields of sensimillia that enlighten and erich our soul
Blood and fire mek it burn bredren
All weak hearts shall lick up and spit up
And all righteous shall stand
Hail, Rasta hail and wail (rastafari)
Hail Rasta don't quail (we not quail)
Let it burn, burn burn
