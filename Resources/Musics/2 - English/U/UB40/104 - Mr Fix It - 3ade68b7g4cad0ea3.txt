MR FIX IT

If you're feeling lonely
Cause your one and only
Boy has found a girl
And gone away
Just you reach for the phone
I'll be there at home
My name is Fix It
And I'll be there
If your heart's been shattered
The pieces are scattered
All across the ground
Of loneliness
Just you reach for the phone
I'll be there at home
My name is Fix It
And I'll be there
Love is not a bed of roses
And life is not a game, it seems
If you're being mistreated by your lover
Then darlin', come see me
And if you're feeling lonely
Cause your one and only
Boy has found a girl
And gone away
Just you reach for the phone
I'll be there at home
My name is Fix It
And I'll be there
