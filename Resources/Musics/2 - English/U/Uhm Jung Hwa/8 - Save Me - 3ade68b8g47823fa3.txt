SAVE ME

Tired and weary, lonely
I canâ€™t breath
I lost myself because I was hurt
It felt like there was no tommorrow

Like a shower of hurt to my heart
You came to me
Now holding hands and into the sea of happiness
I want to go

save me
Free me with your love

love me
Hold me with your spirit

Love me

It was lonely, I was trapped
It felt like there was no love

Becoming a bright light in the dim sky
You came to me
Now holding hands and into the world of happiness
Take me

save me
Free me with your love

love me
Hold me with your spirit

Please

save me
Free me with your love

love me
Hold me with your spirit

Love me
