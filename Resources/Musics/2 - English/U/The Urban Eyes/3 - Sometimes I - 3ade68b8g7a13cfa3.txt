SOMETIMES I

Sometimes I feel
The souls of the heaven
Behind the shadows
Inside the hearts
Eating my dreams
And killing me
Push me to the hell
This is not real
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Sometimes I see
The bodies on the streets
Behind the Money
Inside the shops
Eating all the food
And killing your brothers
Push me to the kings
This is all real
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Sometimes I hear
The sounds of the tools
Of the music
Of the gardens
Of the cries
And stealing my wishes
Push me to the world of sounds
This is all a dark hole
Ahh ahhh ahhh ahhh
