LITTLE BOY

Hey little boy, what have they done to you
They disowned your soul and locked you away in the dark
Oh little boy, no one paid attention to you
When you cried out for help on the quest for your passionate spark

In the thickets of repression
All the years you've been on your own
Any kind of your expression
Trampled down between hearts of stone

And with tears in your eyes
You begin to realize
That now I can hear your voice
So finally, it's time for you to rejoice

Hey little boy, please give me your hand
I show you the world and you teach me how to see it through your eyes
Oh little boy, your life's been so bland
All the crap you've been made to believe in was built upon lies

In the thickets of repression
All the years you've been on your own
Any kind of your expression
Trampled down between hearts of stone

And with tears in your eyes
You begin to realize
That now I can hear your voice
So finally, it's time for you to rejoice

And with tears in your eyes
You begin to realize
That now I can hear your voice
So finally, it's time for you to rejoice
