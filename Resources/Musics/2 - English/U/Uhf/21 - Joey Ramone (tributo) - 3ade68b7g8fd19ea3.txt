JOEY RAMONE (TRIBUTO)

Éramos putos
Anos oitenta
Putos intrusos
Pêlo na venta.

Rock em 2 tons
Forte e suado
Nós e os ramones
No mesmo palco.

Joey i'll remember you
Joey i'll remember you
I'll remember joey ramone
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
Joey i'll remember you.

Foram 3 dias
Porto e cascais
Rock em corrida
Sempre a rolar.

4 no palco
Tal como nós
O som bem alto
Quase feroz.

Joey i'll remember you
Joey i'll remember you
I'll remember joey ramone
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
Joey i'll remember you.

(solo)

I'll remember you
I'll remember you
Joey i'll remember you
Joey i'll remember you
I'll remember joey ramone
I'll remember joey ramone
I'll remember joey ramone
I'll remember joey ramone.
