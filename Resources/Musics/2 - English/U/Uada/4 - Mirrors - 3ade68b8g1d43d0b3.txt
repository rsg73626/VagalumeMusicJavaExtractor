MIRRORS

Oh great mirror, ye who sees through me
Parallel dimension, nebula of symmetry
Shatter my reflection, distort the memories
Oh great mirror, ye who sees through me

Lingering behind the pane
Replicating the here and now
Empathy beyond the sane
Vanishing the optic shroud

Deeper down into the maze
Waiting there the archetype
Entranced in paradigm gaze
Dimmer becomes the inner light

Oh great mirror, ye who sees through me
Parallel dimension, nebula of symmetry
Shatter my reflection, distort the memories
Oh great mirror, ye who sees through me

Fading complexion
Negating direction
Questioning recollection
Telepathic projection

Oh great mirror, ye who sees through me
Parallel dimension, nebula of symmetry
Shatter my reflection, distort the memories
Oh great mirror, ye who sees through me

Diagnostic dissection
Psychiatric objection
Schizophrenic subjection
Stigmatic infection

Ye who sees through me
