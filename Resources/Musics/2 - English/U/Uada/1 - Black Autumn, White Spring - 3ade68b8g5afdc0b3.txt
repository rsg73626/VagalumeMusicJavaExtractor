BLACK AUTUMN, WHITE SPRING

Time of light is falling
Dark of night is drawing near
Transcendental voices calling
Whispering horror and fear
Marching forward all alone
Without vision I can see
Into the depths of the unknown
Are the secrets that will set you free

Distant are the stars that shine
Not only those within our sight
But soaring beyond our highest mind
Internally burning even more bright
Levitating into the sky
Atmospherical breach
Breathing where no air lies
Transcending out beyond our reach

Hollow is the heart
That beats within the earth
Death of winter starts
And Walpurgis brings rebirth

Aries in the moon
Sign of the horned child
Sprint, for death will strike soon
Whisking broad, winged and wild

No dusk without dawn
Nor creation without doom
Infinite is the sun
Eternal is the moon
