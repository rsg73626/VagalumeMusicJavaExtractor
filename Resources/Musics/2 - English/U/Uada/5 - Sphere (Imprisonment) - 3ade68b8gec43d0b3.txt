SPHERE (IMPRISONMENT)

Circular tomb
The mind, body and soul
Framed in flash
Elevating beyond control

Suspended in animation
Timeless, motionless walls
Celestial divination
Echoing throughout our vacant halls

We are of these stars
Long dead before we're seen
Enslaved before our start
Bound in our illusions and dreams

Madness overtake my mind
Let beat my heart to the cadence of the wind
For what else is there left to find
When we are born imprisoned from within?
