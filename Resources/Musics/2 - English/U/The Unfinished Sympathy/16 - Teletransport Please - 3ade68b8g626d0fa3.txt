TELETRANSPORT PLEASE

Just a quiet night
On my dead end street
Heard the rats were running for a false alarm
And the cockroach scream

And the dope
Blown upon my nose
Made my fear decrease
And my head lay low
Need another dose

Oh, this town's a parade
Teletransport please,
Teletransport out of my jail

Another quiet night
On my dead end street
Heard the children yelling
And a short sure shot
From my window slot

And the world
Went comatose
Made a final twist
With a tangent launch
So I crossed the door

Oh, this town's a parade
Teletransport please,
Teletransport out of my jail
