YOUR WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDERS

Lately I've been thinking of you
Cherry shivers from your lips on mine
Ever had a conversation turned
Far aside an ordinary kind?
We were blind
Carry on loves condemned to an end
Carry all your weight on my shoulders
Carrion feeds the crow that threatens us down
Shiny iron bound that stops you
When you cross our confidential line
Not a hope for those who love each other
More than they love their own lives
Carry on loves condemned to an end
Carry all your weight on my shoulders
Carrion feeds the crow that threatens us down
Carry on myself as a friend
Carry all my weight on your shoulders
Carry these questions, love
Will you find out?
