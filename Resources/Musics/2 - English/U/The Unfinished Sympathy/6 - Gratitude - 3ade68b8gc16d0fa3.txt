GRATITUDE

Lately your temper is bringing you down
You promised me sunlught and heat in november
You never had both your feet on the ground
Chasing the flames as I’m walking on ember

You never trust what newspapers say
Nake your own forecast for the weather
Noone believes in your soothsayings
Too many fails for you to remember

Hey, I souldn’t believe what you say
And the truth it will rise
Like a flood in the desert

Bring back the rain
To this thirsty land
Let the wind in your hands
Bring your song through the airwaves
Wings on hold for a crumbing sky
Be the one not to guide your moves with your instinct

There is a subtile charm in your lies
They make you look so humbly affected
Miss al the goof that truth supplies
I will not thank you ‘til I surrender

Hey, I souldn’t believe what you say
And the truth it will rise
Like a flood in the desert

Bring back the rain
To this thirsty land
Let the wind in your hands
Bring your song through the airwaves
Wings on hold for a crumbing sky
Be the one not to guide your moves with your instinct
