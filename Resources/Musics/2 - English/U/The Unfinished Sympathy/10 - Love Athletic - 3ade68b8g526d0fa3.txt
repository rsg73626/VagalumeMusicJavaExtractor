LOVE ATHLETIC

Morning comes at night
At any time
And both our hands are right
One by each side

If anything would come out wrong
And we're running out of time
We would still be marching
And tasting every bite

If you see me burning
For the funeral's done
Don't back out, boy
Don't back out, girl
Today too many hearts grow cold
And you're still hand in hand

Don't back out, boy
Don't back out, girl

Love just goes like tides
When daylight hurts
And builds and tears aside
All human goals

Cause if you just let your life conform
And don't water all your plants
Hear the breakfast calling
Love won't pass hereby
