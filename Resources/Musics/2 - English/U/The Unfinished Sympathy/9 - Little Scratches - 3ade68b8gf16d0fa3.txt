LITTLE SCRATCHES

Across the plains and mountain tops
Her silent call that never stops
Sparkle from a flash machine
Who put the sunshine on your skin?

Little scratches 'round my hands
Little scratches, up in my head, down in my toes

A greedy-eyed cat lives up the block
And I keep my food under lock
Her eyebrows wave like serpentines
To trace these marks upon my skin

Little scratches 'round my hands
Little scratches, up in my head, down in my toes

Little scratches 'round my hands
Little scratches 'round my heart

One day when love comes back
I'll put it on your track
Beyond the peaks and snows
Or one thousand miles below

And when I get undressed
And healed with your caress
I'll kiss you like I swore
One thousand times, or more
One thousand times, or more
