AN INVESTMENT IN LOGISTICS

Dropped and drunk like every night
Body rooted and mind going from town to town
Trying to move my feet to dry my eyes
Beat my head against the wall
To acquire head beat resistance
While my little voice inside says
"Seize your time"
An investment in logistics
An improvement in sophistics
Praying for a simple sleep
Trying to hide in warm in dark in deep
Dying for a simple change of mind
Electric wave beneath the rain
Bread and water for the guilty
Stop self-analysis make some plans
An investment in logistics
An improvement in sophistics
Life's so inscrutable
A cynical spark
As the stop your feet
And push you to the wrong side
But I implore chemicals
Reasons and laws
As my mom said
"Rockstar? Better be a doctor"
