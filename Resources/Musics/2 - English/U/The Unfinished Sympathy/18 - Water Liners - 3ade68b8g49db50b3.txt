WATER LINERS

Ran down the dunes with a light and a spoon
We'd better be listening then cause they'd tell us again no more
Red sky for losers like warnings above
It was a little time so we couldn't wait for love
Hey, it'll work out fine
Take me down the water line and
Leave it al behind
Took off our shame as our lives were so lame
Just like a raving dance of war and prayers for hope
"Thank you for your time, remember my name"
You smiled with glossy eyes "I will never leave you again"
Hey, it'll work out fine
Take me down the water line and
Leave it al behind
Hey, it'll work out fine
Make your flowers grow on my dead soil
I feel so alone
"And if I could ever chance would you come my way? "
You should have known that
You can't carry a heart back
But hey, it'll work out fine
It'll work out
