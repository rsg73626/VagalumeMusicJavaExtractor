DANCE SHE CAME

Left my girl down at the courtyard
Had spent my last night in veil
And drove a mile until the blocks went out
And quit my lane

Now there's a party going on downtown
And my friends keep calling
But my hands are tied
Now there's a party going on downtown
But the rain it falls
Straight to my heart and I know
I'll run, run
Everytime you come I run, run...

Word was out I'd got loose
And dance she came

Now I live around the poor parks
Walk around the drains
And all my neighbours want to kick me out
From my little bench
Still there's a party going on downtown
And I'm tiptoe-tripping 'cos my legs are tied
Still there's a party going on downtown
But the rain it falls
Straight to my heart and I know
I'll run, run
Everytime you come I run, run...
"Why don't you pick up the phone...?"

Word was out I'd got loose
And dance she came
