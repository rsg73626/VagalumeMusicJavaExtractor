NICORETTE

Take me, I've got no time to lock your bolt
Take me, I've got no time
Tired of asking myself about the pros and cons
Of laying in your bed
With you as a landscape to stare with my eyes closed
Give up fights and give up hopes
Give up everything that steals my time
Cause you're not worth for that
Take me, I've got no time to lock your bolt
Take me, I've got no time
I've got no time to change my mind
To think of everything that could have been
And vanished like smoke
I'll learn to live with that
When you grow old and understand
There's something more that these
Romantic thoughts inside my head
Then I'll come
