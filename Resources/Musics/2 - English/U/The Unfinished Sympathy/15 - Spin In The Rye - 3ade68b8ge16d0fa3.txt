SPIN IN THE RYE

She lays on the grass
She still got to learn
It wasn't the rain what made her grow up
Just troubles and pain

A spin in the rye
A watering hole
As everytime I feel so alone
I dial your phone

And I seek in her eyes
And I see my very face
Who I am
It's cold in this lonely road to hell

You, you'd drive all night until you'd knock at my door
I left you standing in the pouring rain
I keep moving like a shark

And I can't deny
The pleasure is mine
When all of the blood I'm spilling around
Sounds like lullaby

But I get shy
When I should say "no"
Your flesh is a feast that turns me on
My values are gone

And I seek in her eyes
And I see my very face
Who I am
It's cold in this lonely road to hell

You, you'd drive all night until you'd knock at my door
I left you standing in the pouring rain
I keep moving like a shark

You, you'd drive all night until you'd knock at my door
I left you standing like a fool in the rain
I keep moving like a shark

I'm mad and on the run
Killing for fun
I'm coming out of hiding when my victim's closer
Again you will rely
On how I justify
Our reasons for intimacy are barely human
