CEASE FIRE

This time blood has dried
You've washed your hands and run away
Just like a long long fight
So summarize and relocate

Drawn all those fears that you can't ignore
The pain you never want to show
This time blood has dried
So move your feet and get away

God help us break out
This war can't be won
God help us break out
Our love is gone

By now our lives have failed
In terms of love and happiness
You know we can't demand
A second chance to live our way

It's all in the tune of every song
It's just the wind against its blow
It's time to watch the signs
Surrender to our bravery

God help us break out
This war can't be won
God help us break out
Our love is gone

God help us break out
This war can't be won
God give us some break now
This love's undone

God help us break out
This war can't be won
God help us break out
Our love is gone

God help us break out
This war can't be won
Don't let it all break down
This love is wrong
