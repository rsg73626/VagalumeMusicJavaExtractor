HOTEL ESPAÃ‘A

Choose life, work it better
We cannot care about you
Choose life, work it better
You've got a lot to run through

Comes and goes
And everybody knows it won't stop
Comes and goes
As any river flows

Everybody knows that you've been sick
And we're not here to judge you anymore
You will have to creep along this hospital
Leave writings on the wall

Everybody knows that you've been sick
And we're not here to hurt you anymore
Maybe you can walk and leave this place away tonight

Choose life, work it better
People live around too
Choose life, work it better
You love nobody but you

Comes and goes
And everybody knows it won't stop
Comes and goes
As any river flows

Everybody knows that you've been sick
And we're not here to judge you anymore
You will have to creep along this hospital
Leave writings on the wall

Everybody knows that you've been sick
And we're not here to hurt you anymore
Maybe you can walk and leave this place away tonight
