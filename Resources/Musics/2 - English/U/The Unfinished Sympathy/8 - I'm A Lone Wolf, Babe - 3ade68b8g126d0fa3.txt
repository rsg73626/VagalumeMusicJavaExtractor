I'M A LONE WOLF, BABE

Make my day and I'll feel sane
It's been a long time and I'm always late
But I'm fine

Make my day I feel no shame for your boring life
'Cos you can always get in mine

Make my day and I'll feel safer
Even rather good times just need to get paid with money

Make my day and I'll feel great
I've got a smooth smooth talk
But now I want to scream

This threatening world is better than Mars
Yet I don't know where to live
I'm a lone wolf, babe
Stuck in rock 'n roll

Make my day and light my flame
It's been a long fight and I always fail
But I'm fine

Make my day and I will tame
All the rebel hard lands
Give a welcome to my army

This threatening world is better than Mars
Yet I don't know where to live
Been a long long long time coming out for you
This threatening world is better than Mars
So pick me up all over the stars
I'm a lone wolf, babe
Stuck in rock 'n roll
