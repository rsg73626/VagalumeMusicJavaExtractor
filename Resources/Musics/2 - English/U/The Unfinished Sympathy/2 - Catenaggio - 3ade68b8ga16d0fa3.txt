CATENAGGIO

Little girl, so afraid
What’re you crying for?
I offeret you my house
But I hid my home

I’m old yet to know I’m wrong

The’re coming from the junkyards
Stealing our bread
And still you keep your hopes
Surrounding my head

I’m old yet to know I’m wrong

Sometimes you can’t recycle
Your frars to energy
And so I0ve got to play hard
Commit some penalty

Year afteryear after year
All our systems fail
Scared and insecure
They smell our trail

I’m old yet to know I’m wrong


I keep them at the gates
Never tread on my floor
We can’t shoot anymore
But they want war

I’m old yet to know I’m wrong

Sometimes you can’t recycle
Your frars to energy
And so I0ve got to play hard
Commit some penalty

It overflows from our hands
It wakes us up at night
We’re skin and bones and ashes
Our defense is our fight
