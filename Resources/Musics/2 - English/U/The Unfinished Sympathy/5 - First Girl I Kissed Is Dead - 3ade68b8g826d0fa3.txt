FIRST GIRL I KISSED IS DEAD

f it's true that God is above this land
What should I care for?
If it's true that God overviews your grants
He'll keep you coming back for more

If it's true that God is above
And it's true that love ain't earthly
If it's you who'll walk underneath his hands
He'll keep you coming back for more

Heaven or hell I really can't tell
Guess I'm away out of this
Now I've got enough work in finding my space
In this town I can't miss

If it's true that God is above this land
What should I pray for?
If it's true, then should I believe my friends
When they have left and found no more?

If it's true that God is above
And it's true he cares for your goodness
If it's true that God is above this land
He'll keep you coming back for more
