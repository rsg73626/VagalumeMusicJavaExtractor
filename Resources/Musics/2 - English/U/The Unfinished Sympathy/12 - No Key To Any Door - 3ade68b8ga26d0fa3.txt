NO KEY TO ANY DOOR

Watch the starlight
The end is here
I'll see no day rise
It's great when you are near

See the old marks
On our tree
There's a strange line
"It's great when you are dead,
I'd be suffering instead"

I've been walking in my soles for long
Still I'm waiting by the call

Watch the starlight
Lush and sad
Watch the starlight
Before you get to bed

"I've seen it all now,
It's not that bad"
Said the old man
"Depends on what you take,
Live in love or live afraid"

I've been walking in my soles for long
Still I'm waiting by the call

Traced no footsteps on my floor
Got no key to any door
