SHARPSHOOTER

I've just been fired out
For laying down
For being lazy
I'd just be staring at the floor

And I can't recall the time
When all was fun
And nights were crazy
Now I'm pointed by your gun

And we danced 'til morning lights
Playing in the streets and standing right
And worst was nothing but a heartbreak

And we danced 'til morning lights
Pumping on our bloodstream smiling bright
It all seemed nothing but a joy tale

Oh sharp, sharpshooter
Don't put your eye on my way
Oh sharp, sharpshooter

I stay here howlin' out
Crying loud
I keep on waiting
For a veredict from God

My teeth they fall in dreams
So black and real
For guilty conscience
I just can't do it on my own

And we danced 'til morning lights
Playing in the streets and standing right
And worst was nothing but a heartbreak

And we danced 'til morning lights
Pumping on our bloodstream smiling bright
It all seemed nothing but a joy tale

Oh sharp, sharpshooter
Don't put you eye on my way
Oh sharp, sharpshooter

He's out behind the window
His eyes stare with no shame
If he goes means a job done
So I better make him stay

He's entering the kitchen
He's calling out my name
I better give him water
So I look I'm not to blame

A feature of condition
Remorse inside a man
This everlasting torture
Will I ever see its end?

He's watching from the distance
I'll get what I deserve
For laying down and wondering
Will I ever be ashamed?
