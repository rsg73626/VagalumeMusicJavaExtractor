SCHOOL EMULATOR

Two steps forth
Six backwards
You're deep into a big depression

In your smile
There's no light
Just hate and a big confusion

Calm my thirst with water
And I'll fill you up with rage
Dealing with your frenzied fist
Is so stimulating

If you bite the hand that feeds you
Starvation will prevail
"Still I love my wife and kids"
You're so educated

It's your right
To play light
No greetings for your contribution

Keep your black
On my back
Gonna carry with your own frustration

Calm my thirst with water
And I'll fill you up with rage
Dealing with your frenzied fist
Is so stimulating

If you bite the hand that feeds you
Starvation will prevail
"Still I love my wife and kids"
You're so educated

Like I still care for the others
I won't drive your mind insane
Always with your basic needs
So guaranteed

When your classmates stood in classroom
You'd remain secure in bed
Still I guess your life has been
A school emulator
