RUNAWAY

Your colour-blind eyes
Confuse the sights
The sights and sounds of
Your lonely little prison
The fireworks flicker on
The television

My sweet precious runaway
Oh say you'll stay

She hums a quiet song
An erotic melody
She runs, runs, runs
With dreams of being free

My sweet precious runaway
My sweet precious runaway
Oh say you'll stay

Oh little fugitive
Where will you go
Your daddy's long gone
And your mother doesn't know
That you're a

Sweet precious runaway
You're a sweet precious runaway
Oh say you're ok, ok
