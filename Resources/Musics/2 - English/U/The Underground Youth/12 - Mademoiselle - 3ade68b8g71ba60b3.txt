MADEMOISELLE

Don't you believe what it's like
She holds down her head just to cry
Then you're the only one I need
And this is the only time I'm free
Free
Don't you know she's coming right back

Your virgin passion intertwined
You're full of speed
Your love is blind
Full of speed, you're love is blind
Blind
You've got to look girl to find yeah yeah
