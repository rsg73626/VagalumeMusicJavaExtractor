RITUAL

Now I know
I'm smarter than you
I foresee everything you do
Where it's born
In the back of your mind
I'll freeze any opinion that you try to find

Give me a mirror
So I can see who I trust
And give me weapons
Of a chemical dust
None of this
Was my intention
All I ever wanted was your attention

This ain't killing for pleasure now
This is ritual
This ain't killing for pleasure man
This is ritual
This ain't killing for pleasure now
This is ritual
This ain't love that you're feeling man
This is ritual
