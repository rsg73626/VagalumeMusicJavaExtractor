IN SOFIA'S REFLECTION

I can't sleep no more
It hurts to lie so still
The reckless youth outside
Drunk and dressed to kill

They share their stolen love
With the hopeless and the ill
But Sofia's all I need
And she's all I ever will

Dressed in black
Her hair glows red
You see her on the screen
Forever her reflection will
Haunt your darkest dream
