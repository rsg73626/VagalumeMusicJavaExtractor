PERSONA

You
Can see the youth
In my eyes
In my eyes
I
I can't die
For your sins
But I'll try
Take
Oh take my heart
Take it far
Take it wide
But girl
Can you keep me
Will you keep me
Inside

Now
Now that I feel
That I'm done
I'm done
Will
Will you love me
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
I
Oh I'm done
I'm done
I'm gone
