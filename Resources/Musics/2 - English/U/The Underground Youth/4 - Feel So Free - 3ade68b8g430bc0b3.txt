FEEL SO FREE

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever it is darling can take you from me

What do you need
What do you see
What is it that makes you feel so free

And isn't it me?

This is the place
This is the time
This is the way I'll make you feel so fine

Come in here
Come with me
Come on baby yeah come to see

I feel so free

This is the time
This is the place
And I can't wait till I can see your face

Anytime
Anyplace
Want darling just to see your face
