RULES OF ATTRACTION

Drink a drink of colour brown
Then cast aside that awkward frown
You should kill the mayor then leave the town
Then drown that clown in a golden tub
Beat the king with an iron club
Then blame it on some awkward thug
Or blame it on some unsold drug
Test the boundaries of society
Push the limits of authority, dabe I'll give you security
"Because I love you"

Dressed as women holding out their hands
Get you to tell your untold plans
Falling, further, father, there he stands
Black or white he just demands
"Sell your soul! " before he lands
Then waiting there in a shit disguise
For nothing more than to idolise
"Boy you move to fast to criticise
And I love you"

Stop at the cafe for coffee and cigarettes
Spend all your money, no regrets
Don't listen to his tired threats
You see he hears my words
Although my voice is poor
I think somewhere there's an unwritten law
That my answers seem to claw
Give me that pen and here I'll draw
A picture that invites the mind
Tickles up and down the spine
Girl just say that you are mine
Please don't you waste my bitter time
I fucking love you

Untold dreams of life you should lead
You see in them all that you should breed
Lives at risk and it's all for greed
Not long now friend you'll soon be freed
Then with the almighty you should plead
I'll sing my song upside down
in a steel cage, gagged and bound
With nothing but the shallow ground
To prove to you 'I love you'
