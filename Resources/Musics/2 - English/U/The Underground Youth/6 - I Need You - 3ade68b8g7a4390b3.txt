I NEED YOU

I'll follow you down
Down underground
'cause I need you
Yeah, I need you

And through this sound
It was you I found
Now I Want you
And I need you

Under the moon
A long goodbye
Alone again with the neon sky

I Know you knew
What I said was true
I believe you
I need you

High or low
Will you ever know
What I'd go through
To be with you
All it look for you to get a
Look at what I'd go
Girl I need you
