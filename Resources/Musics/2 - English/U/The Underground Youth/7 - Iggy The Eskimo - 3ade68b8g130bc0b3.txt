IGGY THE ESKIMO

She's an artist who dreams of a life
Lived out on the edge of a knife
In the bars and caf√©s of Berlin

And many places I've never been
She's always with him
But I know there's more to her within
They called her Iggy and say she looks just like her twin
I wanna be her seat on the streets of Berlin

She's never looked at me twice
I can't seem to get it right
But I wrote poetry to recite
And tonight seems to be the night
It seems to feel alright

She dreams of a life
Lived out on the edge of a knife
