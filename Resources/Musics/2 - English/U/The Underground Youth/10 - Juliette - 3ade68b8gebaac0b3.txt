JULIETTE

She sits in the window
Staring at the sky
Her view of life disarms me
I often wonder why

Juliette
Her eyes fixed in the distance
On the deep scarlet sun
You wouldn't believe she's capable
Of all the things she's done

Her gaze turns from the window
She looks me in the eye
Her lack of trust it kills me
But I'm too young to die
Juliette
