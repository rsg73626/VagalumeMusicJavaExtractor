SILHOUETTE

Your silhouette in the smoke
Your vision fills me with hope
I'll stop at nothing to be true
You can hold my word
I'm coming back for you

The reflection in your eyes
Oh girl you never had a good disguise
And now your silhouette lies in the smoke
You're still a vision
That gives me so much hope
