HEDONISM

And does it feel that cold and lonely
That you never make a sound
Has she fallen down as an angel
Or has she come up form the ground

And does it feel alright
The way she loves you tonight
And does it feel alright
In the heat after the fight

Well your heart it feels like a loaded gun
I wanna wake with you in the morning sun
I wanna make you feel like you've never done
Lets run, darling, run run run

And does it feel alright
The way she loves you tonight
And does it feel alright
In the heat after the fight

And does it feel alright
Does it feel alright
Does it feel alright
Tonight
