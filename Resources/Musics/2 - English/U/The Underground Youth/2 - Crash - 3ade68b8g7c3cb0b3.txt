CRASH

See it, can't you see
that she belongs with me
she crashes just to feel alive
you wanna go for a drive

Can't you see it, can't you see
that the girl belongs with me
with me, with me
the girl belongs with me
she crashes just to feel alive
you wanna go for a drive, oh yeah

I feel it, I feel it
the girl belongs with me
can't you see it, can't you see
that girl belongs with me
when you're walking around, walking around
she's asking about it, asking about me
she can see
