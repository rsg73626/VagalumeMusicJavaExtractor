TOKYO BLUE

Your desire, I need to feel
I'm well aware now, that you're not real
I look up, at the neon cross
And I'm with you, Tokyo Blue

Outside, the snow falls
But I'm inside, climbing the walls
I could live here, live here with you

My darling, Tokyo Blue
I could live here, live here with you
My darling, Tokyo Blue
My darling
