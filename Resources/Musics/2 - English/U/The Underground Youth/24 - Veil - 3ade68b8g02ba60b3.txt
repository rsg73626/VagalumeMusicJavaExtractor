VEIL

She rides a midnight train
To steal your heart and brain
Your dream, your heroine
Seduced by heavens skin

Her life's a mystery
You try so hard to see
For every small detail
She hides behind her veil

You don't know her? name
You pay to play this game
The perfect enemy
For god, for you and me
You want to be the one
Desires virgin son

She walks in naked but for
The thin veil
That covers her breast
That heaves in and out?
With the fever in her eyes
Her eyes that tell you
You should walk away
But you won't
Because you've waited
For so fucking long for this day
For this day
