STRANGLE UP MY MIND

This is the life you've been dreaming of
This is the dream you've been holding onto
She comes and goes
I'll find
A girl to strangle up my mind

This is the fear you've been hiding from
These are the thoughts that you thought were gone
Day after day
Time after time
This girl strangles up my mind

This is the girl you've been dreaming of
This is the breath you've been holding onto
The dreams of her
Were designed
To strangle up your mind
