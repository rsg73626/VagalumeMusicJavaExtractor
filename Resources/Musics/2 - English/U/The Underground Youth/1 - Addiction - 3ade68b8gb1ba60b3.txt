ADDICTION

Take my hand
And we'll descend the mountains path
In the end
I'll remember when you said
Lay your kiss
Gently down upon my chest
Now I've lost
The will to stop you or protest

This is magic, this is god
Something you're afraid of
This is addiction, I guess it's love
Something you're afraid of

Take what you have
Under the stars we look up to
And cover me
With your natural tattoo
Play this song
Sit down here and hold my hand
In the end
I'll remember what you sang

This is magic, this is god
Something you're afraid of
This is addiction, I guess it's love
Something you're afraid of
