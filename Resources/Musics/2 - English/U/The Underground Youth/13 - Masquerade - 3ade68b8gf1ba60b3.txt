MASQUERADE

She was up all night
Just waiting for a sound
The pistol in her hand
Pointing to the ground
Around her bare feet
A floor of broken glass
Her eyes stare out
Of the holes in her mask

It's a, it's a, a masquerade
It's a, it's a, a masquerade

"You showed me heaven
And then you burnt it down
You showed me true love
Then left me to drown"
She wrote this note for him
And left it on the ground
