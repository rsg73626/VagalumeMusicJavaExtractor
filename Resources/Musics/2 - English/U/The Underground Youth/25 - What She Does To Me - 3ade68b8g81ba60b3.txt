WHAT SHE DOES TO ME

Singing your sweet song
I feel alive
Waiting right here
For you to arrive
Yes she makes me
Makes me free
For I was blind
But now I see

It's what she does to me
What she does to me

You've got your love babe
You've got your art
And I believe in it all
I have from the start
Yes she makes me
Makes me free
For I was blind
But now I see

It's what she does to me
It's what she does to me
