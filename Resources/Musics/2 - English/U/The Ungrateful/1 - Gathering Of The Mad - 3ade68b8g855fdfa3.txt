GATHERING OF THE MAD

A stronger opinion crawls out of you
Another language with an emotion of rage
There's too many confessions to make
Too god damn many stands to take

There is much you must keep inside
The pressure will bring out
Some kind of passion for hate
You might not even know

What goes on inside your own son
And what is there to find
If you seek

Solitarys under one black flag
Rejected to the core
If you seek

Beneath the underground
The gathering of the mad Human (huuh)
That's what we're supposed to be
The blessed the wicked

A very fine line between the intellect and the insanity
Just a matter of fate
If you will live in agony
A revolution in mind
