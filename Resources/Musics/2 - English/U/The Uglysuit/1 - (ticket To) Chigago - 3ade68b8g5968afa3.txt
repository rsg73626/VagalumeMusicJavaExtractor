(TICKET TO) CHIGAGO

I tried to sleep in the rain, underneath an acorn tree, but the drops kept falling,
hitting me, as I slipped further unconsciously, into a world of windy dreams.
Into a world of many windy dreams.

And where did I begin 
to drift off to that I think that I can fly.
My mind, I took it to Chicago.

The temperatures dropped to a stunning three degrees and I can hardly feel my legs.
Just as I had almost lost my mind completely, the seas had shown a sign to melt.
I sailed away towards many days. I sailed away so many ways.

And where did I begin to drift off to that I think that I can fly.
My mind, I took it to Chicago.
