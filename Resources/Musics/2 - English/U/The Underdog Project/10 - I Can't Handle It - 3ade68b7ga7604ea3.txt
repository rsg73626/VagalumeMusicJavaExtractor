I CAN'T HANDLE IT

I can't handle it
What can I do to get you out my life?
Playing silly games and messing with my mind
I can't handle it
I think that you just went too far this time
Now I'm moving on
'Cause it's all over

Every woman
Needs a man
That can hold her
And understand
But if you knew
How to treat a woman
She would've stayed
But it's all over now
And I can't take it no more
And I'm headed out that door
But it's okay
That you're not in my life
But I know I'll be alright

I can't handle it
What can I do to get you out my life?
Playing silly games and messing with my mind
I can't handle it
I think that you just went too far this time
Now I'm moving on
'Cause it's all over
(repeat)

You're all alone
And it's a shame
That things couldn't go the other way
But it's too late
Got to get away
It seems like I've been with you forever
In a day
And I can't take it no more
And I'm headed out that door
But it's okay
That you're not in my life
But I know I'll be alright

I can't handle it
What can I do to get you out my life?
Playing silly games and messing with my mind
I can't handle it
I think that you just went too far this time
Now I'm moving on
'Cause it's all over
(repeat)

Na-na-na-na [x2]

I can't handle it
What can I do to get you out my life? [na na na na]
Playing silly games and messing with my mind [na na na na]
I can't handle it
I think that you just went too far this time
Now I'm moving on
'Cause it's all over

I can't handle it
What can I do to get you out my life?
Playing silly games and messing with my mind
I can't handle it
I think that you just went too far this time
Now I'm moving on
'Cause it's all over
