SATURDAY NIGHT

We got a party goin on, get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up! 

We got a party goin on, get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up! 


Every wakin' minute 
I sit here thinking of you 
And can't wait to get in it (in it) 
I'm waiting for the week to be through 

Saturday's the only day I wake up thinkin about 
Cause any other day is just another day no doubt 
Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go through my mind 
And everybody's working for the weekend 

Everything is over on a Saturday night 
Tonight got all my fellows with their honey's by my side 
The DJ spins a record, till he hits the morning light 
And everything's gonna be OK 
Cause it's a Saturday 

Ain't thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it's alright 
Ain't thinking about Thursday or Friday cause tonight's is Saturday night 

Every wakin' hour 
I think about your silo by my side 
And I can't wait much longer 
Wanna show you how I feel for you tonight 

Saturday's the only day I wake up thinkin' about 
Cause any other day is just another day no doubt 
Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go through my mind 
And everybody's working for the weekend 

Everything is over on a Saturday night 
Tonight got all my fellows with their honey by my side 
The DJ spins a record, till he hits the morning light 
And everything's gonna be OK 
Cause it's a Saturday 
Everything is over on a Saturday night 
Tonight got all my fellows with their honey's by my side 
The DJ spins a record, till he hits the morning light 
And everything's gonna be OK 
Cause it's a Saturday 

Ain't thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it's alright 
Ain't thinking about Thursday or Friday cause tonight is Saturday night
