The Underdog Project – 24/7

I just wanna be with you (2x)

I just wanna be with you
Every day, every night
Do all I wanna do
Every time I think of you
In my heart, in my soul
I wanna be with you 

When I wakeup in the morning
And I see the sunshine it in
Is my heart that you are warming
And I can’t wait for to stay to begin

I just wanna be with you (2x)

I just wanna be with you
Every day, every night
Do all I wanna do
Every time I think of you
In my heart, in my soul
I wanna be with you

Ouo, yeah, yeah, yeah! (2x)

When you got my body open
You hold my heart in a palm of your hand
And if you like where this is going
I wanna have you for a one night stand

I just wanna be with you
Every day, every night
Do all I wanna do
Every time I think of you
In my heart, in my soul
I wanna be with you

Ouo, yeah, yeah, yeah! (2x)

Ooooh, you’re the reason why I’m liven
Ooooh, special heart that you are giving
Ooooh, now with you I feels like heaven
Ooooh, think about you 24/7

I just wanna be with you
Every day, every night
Do all I wanna do
Every time I think of you
In my heart, in my soul
I wanna be with you

I just wanna be with you (2x)
