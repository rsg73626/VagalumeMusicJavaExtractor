BABY IT'S I

Baby it's I
Baby it's I
Baby it's I

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I

I don't understand it, tell me why you're hanging on
He's doing fo himself instead of doing for you
He's taking you for granted, can't you see the love is gone?
I can see it in your eyes you've found somebody new
Oh girl

Someone who will never leave you all alone
Someone who tell you're the only one
Someone who's always there for you
Somebody, girl, who knows you like I do

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I

It isn't like I planned it, I ain't tryna play no games
You asked me what I throught, so I'm bringing the truth, oh yeah
So don't misunderstand this, I ain't tryna make you stay
But I can think of somebody better for you

Someone who will never leave you all alone
Someone who tell you're the only one
Someone who's always there for you
Somebody, girl, who knows you like I do

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I

Someone who will never leave you all alone
Someone who tell you're the only one
Someone who's always there for you
Somebody, girl, who knows you like I do

Someone who will never leave you all alone
Someone who tell you're the only one
Someone who's always there for you
Somebody, girl, who knows you like I do

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I

Ooh baby it's I, I'm the one who wants you
Baby it's I, and I'm the one you come to
Baby it's I, ooh baby it's I
