SATURDAY

When the sun goes down at night 
Everything's the same 
When I lay back I close my eyes 
I think about your face 
Just the smell of your angel perfume 
Makes some men like me go insane
Forget about all the money and cars 
Forget about the thing

You so fine
I can't deny
?? just me and you it's all tonight - all tonight
You so cute 
In rondevous
Just me and you with first ??? that what will do

Girl it's on cause the day is saturday
Saturday is for you and me to party
Yes it's on cause the day is saturday
Saturday it's my favorite day I hope that you will stay with me tonight
