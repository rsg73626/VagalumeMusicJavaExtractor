Sometimes through situations, which can’t be handle without a friend

Lovers come and go but they always, they always turn their back on you 
But my love, is forever and I will stay, stay true to you

And I will help you to hold on, be sure I will always got your back 
So many times you trusted in me, and I never dissapointed you 
I promise to be your man, you know that I’ll be there for you 

I will always be your friend, so you can always count on me 
I will always be your friend, so you can always count on me 
I will always be your friend, so you can always count on me 
I will always be your friend, so you can always count on me
