Tell me can u feel, 
We've got the love tonight, 
Music people, we gonna see the light

Chorus:
Cause you're a shining star, 
And you shine so bright, 
So move you're body right to the beat of life, 
Cause it feels so good, and the time is right.
Now all I need, 
All you need, 
All we need.
Is peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.

*We can make it real, and be keeped inside, 
Partypeople, come and join the rhime

Chorus:
Cause you're a shining star, 
And you shine so bright, 
So move you're body right to the beat of life, 
Cause it feels so good, and the time is right.

All you need, 
All we need.
Is peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.

*Remember, music has no colour, so we all gotta live, love and
Learn from eachother, 
To my sister and my brothers, 
Sing your fathers and baby mother, 
This is a soundtrack of your life, 
So don't forget you're roots and you're culture.

Chorus:
Cause you're a shining star, 
And you shine so bright, 
So move you're body right to the beat of life, 
Cause it feels so good, and the time is right.
Now all I need, 
All you need, 
All we need.
Is peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
Peace and unity, and love and having fun.
