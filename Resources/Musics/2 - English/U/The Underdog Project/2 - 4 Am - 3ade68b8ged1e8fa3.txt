4 AM

Every wicked minute
I sit here thinking of you
I can´t wait to get in
I´m waiting for the week to be trough

Saturday´s the only day I wake up thinking ´bout
Cause any other day is just another day no doubt
Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go trough my mind
And everybody´s working for the weekend

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
Tonight I´ve got all my fellows with their honeys by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till it hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be OK
Cause it´s a Saturday

Ain´t thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it´s alright
Ain´t thinking about Thursday or Friday cause tonight´s Saturday night

Every wicked hour
I think about the single by my side
And I can´t wait much longer
Wanna show you how I feel for you tonight

Saturday´s the only day I wake up thinking ´bout
Cause any other day is just another day no doubt
Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go trough my mind
And everybody´s working for the weekend

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I´ve got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till it hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be OK
Cause it´s a Saturday

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I´ve got all my fellows with their honeys by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till it hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be OK
Cause it´s a Saturday

Ain´t thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it´s alright
Ain´t thinking about Thursday or Friday cause tonight´s Saturday night

Saturday´s the only day I wake up thinking ´bout
Cause any other day is just another day no doubt
Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go trough my mind
And everybody´s working for the weekend

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
Tonight I´ve got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till it hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be OK
Cause it´s a Saturday

And thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it´s alright
And thinking about Thursday or Friday cause tonight´s Saturday night

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I´ve got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till it hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be OK
Cause it´s a Saturday...
