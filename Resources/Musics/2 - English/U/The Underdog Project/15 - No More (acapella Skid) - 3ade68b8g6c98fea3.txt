NO MORE (ACAPELLA SKID)

I don't wanna see you 
No more 
No more

No more
No more
No more
No more

Is it too hard for you to the ??? of the ??? you've done to me
Follin around with my best girl-friend is a what a play you need
I don't let to play with my own boy-friend - the game called hadden seek
Cold and lonely nights about my self - this is not for me

I don't wonna see you no more
Want you now walk out the door
And don't you come back no more
And leave me

I don't wonna see you no more
Want you now walk out the door
And don't you come back no more
And leave me

A lot of people try to tell me
How do life my life into dade a man
But I don't wanna have nobody
And that's what they just don't understand
I try to find the one but I wasted my time
And now they only friends
You had'a your chance - You made new friends
And this is how it ends

See you no more
Want you now walk out the door
And don't you come back no more
And leave me

I don't wonna see you no more
Want you now walk out the door
And don't you come back no more
And leave me

I just wanna have a lover who is good to me
I don't wanna surfer be stay away from me

I wanna have a lover who is good to me
I just don't wanna stay away from me

No more
No more
Walk out that door
Come back no more
And close the door

I don't wonna see you no more
Want you now walk out the door
And don't you come back no more
And leave me

I don't wonna see you no more
Want you now walk out the door
And don't you come back no more
And leave me

And leave me
