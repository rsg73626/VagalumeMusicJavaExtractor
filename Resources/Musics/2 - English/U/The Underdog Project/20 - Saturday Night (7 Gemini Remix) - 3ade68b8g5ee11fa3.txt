Verse 1 (Ski):
Running with the beef you wer'e coming thru
I said it's the baddest son of a... that you knew
I took the bounce of a thug when we hit the door
And shorty showin' us love as soon as we hit the
floor
Another saturday night and we're gonna play it boss
That's right, another one from the Underdogs
So if you really wanna flauce with the big dogs
And if your feeling is cool, let me hear ya'll
Better yet throw your hands in the atmosphere
So I can see how many of my people up in here
So I can see how many of my people up in here
So I can see how many of my people up in here

Chorus (Vic Krishna):
Saturday night
Is the time that we can go, hit it and party
Saturday night
Don't waste your time, c'omn let's get is started

Verse 2 (Ski):
When I pull up on the avenue in my nav,
I'm noticing how, shorty looking like she wanna holla
back
Could it be that she noticed I'm that
Cat that sang
On my whips sitting lawn on the 20 inch things
All the green grom the pling on the rings have
changed
Or could it be she just want me to make her holla my
name
So yo shorty where the party at Underdog keep it hot,

Yo believe that, believe that, believe that

Chorus (Vic Krishna):

Verse 3 (Vic Krishna):
Every waken minute (oh yeah!)
I sit here thinkin of you
Can't wait to get in it
Waiting for the week to be thrue

Verse 4 (Alpha Omega):
I'm gonna say this one time, to make myself clear
It's the end of the week and I'm up in here
To shake control overload, now shorty feel me
I trade your ice to glass, supplied with the hennacy
Compliments on the house, and let the games begin
It is saturday night, and I don't see no end
So watch me get silly with it and split the
dancefloor
With a shot to the face, and a chorus that's micro
I make them show what they show, go for what they
know
Blow for blow shake them down like every letter I
flow
And like you know ain't nothing wipeout what we got
here
But join the atmosphere, of my oral up in here
And make this saturday night, flow to no glow
They took the O on the flow, just let yourself go
And don't be get with mine and this can go on
And ain't no room for glow so let's get it on
And in the...

Chorus 'til end:
Saturday night
Is the time that we can go, hit it and party
Saturday night
Don't waste your time, c'omn let's get is started
