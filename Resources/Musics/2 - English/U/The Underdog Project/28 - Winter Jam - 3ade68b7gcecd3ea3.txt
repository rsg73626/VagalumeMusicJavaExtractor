Winter Jam
The Underdog Project

[INTRO:] 
(Hey-yeah, winter jam) 
(Hey-yeah) 
(Hey-yeah, as much as we can) 
(Hey-yeah, winter jam) 

[VERSE 1:] 
Moonlight 
we spend lifetime together feeling so right 
let's make it last forever 
and I'll hold you tight 
it's such a wonderful life 
(wonderful life) 

Moonlight 
the streets are covered in a snowy white 
I see the joy it brings when I look in your eyes 
you're such a beautiful sight, Ooh.. 
(What a beautiful sight) 
I can't get you out of my mind 
I can't lie 
All I need is you in this special time 
and I'm glad to say that you are mine 
'cause I can't take it 

[CHORUS:] 
This ain't nothing but a winter jam 
Good times with family and friends woah! 
This ain't nothing but a winter jam 
We're gonna celebrate as much as we can 
(much as we can) 
(much as we can) 
This ain't nothing but a winter jam 
We're gonna celebrate as much as we can 

Hey-yeah, whoa-oh 
Hey-yeah, winterjam, alright 
Hey-yeah, whoa-oh 
Hey! 

[VERSE 2:] 
Tonight cruisin' down the boulevard starlight 
people singing every day and every night 
as far as the eye can see 
ohhhh.. 

I can't get you out of my mind 
I can't lie 
All I need is you here in this special time 
and I'm glad to say that you are mine 
on a winter moment 

[CHORUS:] 
This ain't nothing but a winter jam 
Good times with family and friends woah! 
This ain't nothing but a winter jam 
We're gonna celebrate as much as we can 
(much as we can) 
(much as we can) 
This ain't nothing but a winter jam 
We're gonna celebrate as much as we can 

Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, 
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, 
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, 
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, 
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, 
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, 
(repeat til fade)
