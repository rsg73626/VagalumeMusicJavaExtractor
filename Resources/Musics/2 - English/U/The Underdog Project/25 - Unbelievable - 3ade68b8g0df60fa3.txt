UNBELIEVABLE

It's unbelievable
What i feel for you
Love is undenaiable
After all we've been through

'Cause you're the reason i'm breathing
I lay down with the hope and the need
And maybe it seems to perfect to believe
That you're all i need

Without you in my life
I don't think i could never survive
If i didn't have you
Then there was no reason to be living at all

You're unbelievable
You're unbelievable

This is so unbreakable
That is what we are
Love is unmistakable
Even when we're apart

Sometimes i feel like i'm dreaming
When you're laying here next to me
And maybe it seems too perfect to believe
That you're all i need

Without you in my life
I don't think i could never survive
If i didn't have you
Then there was no reason to be living at all

You're unbelievable

 *Refr√£o

When you're away
I don't think i would never survive
I still lay upon this mails and wait
Half of the mess
Is all that i end up when you're in my dream

Without you in my life
I don't think i could never survive
If i didn't have you
Then there was no reason to be living at all
