MY ARMS KEEP MISSING YOU

I keep telling myself it's all right
Even though I cry
I keep telling myself it's all right
Even though I cry
I keep telling myself it's all right
Even though I cry

I keep telling myself it's all right
Even though I cry
there's no question why
How could I be happy when

(REFR√ÉO)
My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you
since you went away
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you
come back today
