ENDLESS LOVE

There's something that I need to say
I feel this is the only way
I need to say I Love You... I Love You
Let me show you what you mean to me
You came and gave yourself to me
You have been sent from above

And I'm so glad that you came along
and step into my life
And love makes me feel full
and always leaves me satisfied
And that's why (that's why)... you're mine

Endless love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
'Cause you open up and let me in
And you know what's true in my heart

That you're my endless love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
'Cause you open up and let me in
And you know what's true in my heart

That you're my endless love...

I'm thinking of you in my soul
Don't wanna let you go
How I feel will never go
I just want you endlessly
Lovin' ways in the family
'Cause I'm feeling for your love

And I'm so glad that you came along
and step into my life
And love makes me feel full
and always leaves me satisfied
And that's why (that's why)... you're mine

Endless love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
'Cause you open up and let me in
And you know what's true in my heart

That you're my endless love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
'Cause you open up and let me in
And you know what's true in my heart

Endless love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
'Cause you open up and let me in
And you know what's true in my heart

That you're my endless love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
'Cause you open up and let me in
And you know what's true in my heart

That you're my endless love...
