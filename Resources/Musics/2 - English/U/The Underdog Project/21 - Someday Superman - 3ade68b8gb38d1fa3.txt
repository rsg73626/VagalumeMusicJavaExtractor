SOMEDAY SUPERMAN

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail 
once you provoke her, rattling of her tail 
never begins it, never, but once engaged... 
never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage 

don't tread on me 

so be it 
threaten no more 
to secure peace is to prepare for war 
so be it 
settle the score 
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore... 

don't tread on me 

love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite 
quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike 
shining with brightness, always on surveillance 
the eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance 

don't tread on me 

so be it 
threaten no more 
to secure peace is to prepare for war 
so be it 
settle the score 
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore... 

don't tread on me 

so be it 
threaten no more 
to secure peace is to prepare for war 

liberty or death, what we so proudly hail 
once you provoke her, rattling on her tail 

so be it 
threaten no more 
to secure peace is to prepare for war 
so be it 
settle the score 
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore... 

don't tread on me
