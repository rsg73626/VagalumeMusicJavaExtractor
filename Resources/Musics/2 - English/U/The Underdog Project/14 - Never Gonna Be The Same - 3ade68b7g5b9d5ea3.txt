NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME

Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Everywhere I go
I see you, place and time that reminds me
I love you, you still know
I stop and close my eyes
And I try (and I try), not to cry (not to cry)
But the rain goes keep on faling from my eyes
And you need to know, 
that you're the reason why

And I, Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Oh, oh, oh.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, uh, oh.
Never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Since you've gone away
Lonely, this is where I've been living
Each and every day (each and every day)
I want to change my life
And I try (and I try), not to cry (not to cry)
But the rain tries keep on faling from my eyes
And you need to know
That you're the reason why (you're the reason why)

Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now (need you now,need you now)
I'm never gonna be the same again (need, to be) 
Never gonna be the same

Everywhere I go
I see you, place and time that reminds me
I love you, you still know
I stop and close my eyes (baby, baby)

Never gonna be the same without you
Never gonna be the same I need you now (oh)
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same

Never gonna be the same without you (oh)
Never gonna be the same I need you now (oh)
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never gonna be the same
