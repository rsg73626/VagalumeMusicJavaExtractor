MIAMI

Everybody loves Miami (2x)
Everybody loves Miami
The ocean drives to spend days on the Jet Ski
There's  one thing I know for sure
I don't want to leave this place no more
Every body loves Miami
The ocean drives to spend days on the Jet Ski
There's  one thing I know for sure
I don't want to leave this place no more
Beautiful people
Beautiful life
Where the boys and girls
Are jumping double Dutch
And the party goes on all night
It doesn't matter 
where you come from
But you can't forget about the summer love
That you made in the floured sun
Where the ocean is kissing the sand
Beautiful women in good looking men 
Getting the groove on, getting ready for the night 
In Miami
Everybody loves Miami
The ocean drives to spend days on the Jet Ski
There's  one thing I know for sure
I don't want to leave this place no more
Everybody loves Miami (4x)
Picture Miami
And then you will see
Where are often sea in just rend least 
Of a place is in hardly love 
Where the ocean is kissing the sand
Beautiful women in good looking men 
Getting the groove on, getting ready for the night 
In Miami
Everybody loves Miami
Every body loves Miami
The ocean drives to spend days on the Jet Ski
There's a one thing I know for sure
I don't want to leave this place no more

Where the ocean is kissing the sand
Beautiful women in good looking men 
Getting the groove on, getting ready for the night 
In Miami
Everybody loves Miami
The ocean drive to spending days on the Jet Ski

I don't want to leave this place no more
The ocean drive to spending days on the Jet Ski
