1000 MILES

another show, another fight, another beer, another sleepless night 
no food or money it's all pay to play 
drive all night to work an eight hour day 
seven years of playin shows, where it ends no one knows 
there's confusion in my head, I wish I was in my bed 
driving in a beat up van, you wanna critisize the band 
you don't know what we go through, FUCK YOU 

1000 miles away from home 
where we'll end up no one knows 

another city, another town 
another transmisson run into the ground 
but you gotta keep going as fast as you can 
seeing the world from the back of a van 
how long will we sit at home, get me to the open road 
I can't pay my fucking rent, all my money has been spent 
homeless for the next few weeks, can we stay with you to sleep 
I'd rather make this my life, it's better than working nine to five
