LIVE IN FEAR

dead end generation you should live in fear 
mass destruction, corruption and no one cares 
white is the color of those in power 
red is the color of the millions slaughtered 
blue is the color of the flesh that rots 
murderers go free while some are never caught 
it's been said before it's time to listen 
tune into the news you don't know what you're missing 

lies, deceit, injustice 
this is how our culture lives 

six year olds with fucking guns 
run away youth on the fucking run 
parents who abuse their kids 
yet we're told be proud where we fucking live 
proud for crime, proud for death 
proud for the fucking poor who tried their best 
told to vote, cast your ballot 
but the vote only counts if you're the few in power.
