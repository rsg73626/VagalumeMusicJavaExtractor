SO THIS IS FREEDOM

when a black man can't walk certain streets 
without being hassaled by the pigs 
when the youth are forced into the school system 
designed to break the will of the kids 
when you don't feel safe walking the streets 
of your own fucking hometown 
just cause you look different 
people always try to push you around 

so this is freedom 

live in a capatalist system that says 
you gotta work just to survive 
but when you're stuck in a dead end job 
are you really alive? 
then they tax us on what we earn 
to pay for their fucking wars 
the cold war, war on drugs 
the secret war out on the poor 

go to school, learn to trade, do as i say you better behave 
if this is freedom how come i feel like a fucking slave?
