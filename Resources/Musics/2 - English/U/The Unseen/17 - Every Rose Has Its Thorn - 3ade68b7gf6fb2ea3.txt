EVERY ROSE HAS ITS THORN

[Originally by Poison]

We both lie silently still in the dead of the night 
Although we both lie close together 
We feel miles apart inside 
Was it somethin' I said or somethin' I did 
Did my words not come out right 
Tho' I tried not to hurt you 
Tho' I tried 
But I guess that's why they say 

Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn 
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song 
Every rose has its thorn 

Yeah it does 

I listen to your favorite song playin' on the radio 
Hear the DJ say love's a game of 
Easy come and easy go 
But I wonder does he know 
Has it ever felt like this 
And I know that you'd be here right now 
If I could have let you know somehow I guess 

Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn 
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song 
Every rose has its thorn 

Though it's been a while now 
I can still feel so much pain 
Like the knife that cuts you 
The wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains 

I know I could have saved our love that night 
If I'd known what to say 
Instead if making love 
We both made our separate ways 

Now I hear you've found somebody new 
And that I never meant that much to you 
To hear that tears me up inside 
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess 

Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn 
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song 
Every rose has its thorn
