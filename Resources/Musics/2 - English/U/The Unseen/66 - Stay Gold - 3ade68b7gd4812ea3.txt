STAY GOLD

On the run, no turning back

They were the kids no one seemed to like
Grew up fast always had to fight
Dead end kids from no where homes
Shattered dreams and broken bones
Picked on cause they didnâ€™t have shit
Held their heads high theyâ€™d never submit
Lived their lives in a constant fight
Felt no shame cause they knew they were right

Theyâ€™re the kids who spent their lives living on the wrong side of the tracks
They made just one mistake and now thereâ€™s no turning back

Then one night all hell broke loose
Stakes were high but they had nothing to lose
Soc.â€™s were cocked with the odds in their favor
Johnny fought back in fear and anger
Soc.â€™s screams his body hits the ground
Now theyâ€™re fucked and they gotta leave town
Cops will swarm but they wonâ€™t listen
Theyâ€™ll see one dead rich kid 
And two poor killers

Theyâ€™re the kids who spent their lives living on the wrong side of the tracks
They made just one mistake and now thereâ€™s no turning back

On the run, no turning back
