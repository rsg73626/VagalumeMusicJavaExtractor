PAINT IT BLACK

I see a red door and I want it painted black,
no colors anymore, I want them to turn black.
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,
with flowers and my love both never to come back.
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away,
like a new born baby, it just happens every day.

I look inside myself and see my heart is black,
I see my red door and it has been painted black.
Maybe then I'll  fade away and not have to face the facts,
no, it's not easy facin' up when your world is black.

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,
I could not foresee this thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun,
my love will laugh with me before the morning comes.

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm..
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm..

I wanna see it painted, painted black.
Black as night, black as coal,
I wanna see the sun blotted from the sky,
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black.

Black as night, black as coal,
I wanna see the sun blotted from the sky,
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black.
