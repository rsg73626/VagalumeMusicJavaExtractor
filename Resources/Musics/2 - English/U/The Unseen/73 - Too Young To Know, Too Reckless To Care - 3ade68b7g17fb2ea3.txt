TOO YOUNG TO KNOW, TOO RECKLESS TO CARE

too young to know, we're too reckless to care 
too young to know, you were never even there 
too young to know, we're too reckless to care 
too young to know, now i just dont fucking care! 

hello dear father you did a hell of a job 
i sit and ponder wondering what the fuck is wrong 
heres some toys, give this check to your mom 
cause if i dont pay, the judge wont let daddy come 

too young to know, we're too reckless to care 
too young to know, you were never even there 
too young to know, we're too reckless to care 
too young to know, now i just dont fucking care! 

the marriage vows are such a fucking joke 
how many times can one person have and hold 
sickness and health means nothing to me 
we are the future of this dysfunctional society 

too young to know, we're too reckless to care 
too young to know, you were never even there 
too young to know, we're too reckless to care 
too young to know, now i just dont fucking care! 

pack your bags and leave the family you built 
i hope youre feeling lots of lonliness and guilt 
so many fuck and knock there girlfriends up 
desert your family and let your kids raise themselves 

HEY DAD FUCK YOU
