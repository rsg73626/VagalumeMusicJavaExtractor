NO TURNING BACK

I'm sick in the mind, body, and soul 
this way of living has taken it's toll 
i'm abusing myself, but I'll never learn 
I just want to watch this city burn 

there's no turning back, once you've turned your back 

I'm sick of the human race 
wanna see society laid to waste 
of the people who destroy more than they create 
live to kill, love to hate 

I used to feel sympathy but now it's all just apathy 
I'll just turn my back as the world burns all around me 
am I dying for a change or just dead on the inside? 
maybe I don't look cause I'm not sure what I'll find 
so I point the finger at whose to blame 
but deep inside, we're all the same 
is this me, can it be? 
have I become... one of them?
