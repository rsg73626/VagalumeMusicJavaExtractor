ARE WE DEAD YET?

there's a heat down on the street 
and it's radiating through my feet 
there will be trouble in allston tonight 
there's a kid with a silent shout 
'cause he's livin' off of hand to mouth 
hey generation. i'm talkin' to YOU. 

are we did yet? 
NO! 

street lamps flicker and the young wolves wail 
as the vultures drag another off to jail 
if they had their way you know 
we would've been dead 20 years ago 
do you think they really care about you? 
NO WAY. 

how's this for an answer? 
FUCK YOU.
