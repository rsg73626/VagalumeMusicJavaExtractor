FORCE FED

What they feed you, is all lies...
And all you can do is... WONDER WHY!!

Brainwash the masses with corrupt authority
You're led like puppets on a string 
Yeah it's so nauseating! 
We live in a corrupted world
It's gonna fail, we're gonna die! 
Don't read the papers, or watch the news.
Don't bother, don't view!

The propaganda, what you're fed is fake!
I don't know how much more I can take...
Of that propaganda, what you're fed is fake!
I don't know how much more I can take!

We all make mistakes, 
some live their life so great 
Others are dealt a bad hand 
And live their life irate! 
Is it to late? 
Have we all sealed our fate
We must sit back! 
We must sit back! 
We must sit back and view!


The propaganda, what you're fed is fake!
I don't know how much more I can take...
Of that propaganda, what you're fed is fake!
I don't know how much more I can take!

What they feed you... is all lies! 
And ll you can do is... Wonder why!
Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! 

You're in a hole! 
Nowhere to go! 
You see the top, but you... 
Can't your goal!
You gotta reach...
Up to the sky!
Try to escape...
Before you die!
