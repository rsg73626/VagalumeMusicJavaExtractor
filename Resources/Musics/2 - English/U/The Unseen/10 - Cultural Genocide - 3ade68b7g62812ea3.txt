CULTURAL GENOCIDE

you family's lived here for generations 
but you can't afford it no more 
we're making room for the corporations 
got no room for the poor 
rent is up, so you are out, we fall deaf to all your cries 
this use to be your neighborhood 
now you've been gentrified 

what's really at the stake ain't real estate 
you're talking about people's lives 
rip the heart from a community 
their culture surely dies 

they call it progress but who moves ahead? 
the people who control the wealth 
'cause of their actions people end up dead 
they only care about themselves 
playing god, who goes? who stays? 
who the fuck are you to decide? 
they call it progress but it is a cultural genocide 

gentrified, genocide
