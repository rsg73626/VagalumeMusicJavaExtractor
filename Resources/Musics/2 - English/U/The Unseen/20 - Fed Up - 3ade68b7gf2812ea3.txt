FED UP

Happiness is hard to find
Everyone else has it I guess I'm blind
NO all I see is utter lies
Shake my head and close my eyes
But I cant escape and I question myself why?
Call it negativity - it's reality
You've got eyes look and you'll see
Envisioning life through my eyes
I'm so fed up I wish that I was blind.
It's coming back it's oh so clear
I used to feel sorrow now I don't care
Depression, anger, hate, ignite
It detonates and I feel all right
You all feed the fire
I'll sit and watch it burn
Oh.
I wish that I was blind
Fed up
I'm fed up and I wish that I was blind
