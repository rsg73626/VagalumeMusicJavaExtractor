SOCIAL SECURITY

I'm a punk get off my ass 
because I'm fucking working classs 
I get up everyday and go to work 
I'm treated like a fucking jerk 
They suck my money every week 
now my future's looking bleak 
they say the money's almost gone 
but what will I do when my time comes 

hey! hey! hey! 

Blue collar job you and I 
kiss your hard-earned dough goodbye 
Soon you'll be old you'll be gray 
And how will you earn your pay 
For over 40 years you broke your back 
But they gave your money to some bum on crack 
they say we won't get it 
but fucking the govt's leeches are still money sucking 

hey! hey! hey! 

Did you hear what they want to do to you and me 
they wanna take away our social security
