NEW WORLD DISORDER

our culture, our culture,
our culture has been lost.
how many, how many,
how many lives are at cost?
will you survive,
will you survive and watch other's die?
you have no chance, you have no
chance if you want to remain alive
new world disorder
as far as I can see
new world disorder
no hope for you or me.
our system, our system,
our system no longer exists.
scream, yell louder no one will help
they helped before it was their job
well they got paid. money gets health and power.
and ceased the other day.
oh
