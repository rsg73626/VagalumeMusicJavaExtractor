UNSEEN CLASS

we do this for ourselves 
and we do this for all of you 
it's just the four of us doin what we do 

oi! oi! oi! 

you don't like what we're doing 
you can fuck off 
if you don't like what you're hearing 
then you don't applaud 

oi! oi! oi! 

so fuck all of you, fuck your callous ways 
society doesn't care what we have to say 
so fuck all of them, fuck their careless ways 
the lower class is unseen, & its time we had 
our say 

oi! oi! oi! 

lower class fights to survive 
make just enough to get by 
don't let system bring you down 
some day our time will come 

oi! oi! oi!
