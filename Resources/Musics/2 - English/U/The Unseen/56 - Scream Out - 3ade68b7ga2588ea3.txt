SCREAM OUT

Well all my life music saved me
I cant afford your therapy
My frustration it needs release
Cut me open and hear me bleed
Playing punk it keeps me sane
I don't need drugs to numb the pain
It keeps me alive I hope it helps you
I wont let your your worthless America ruin me

NO WAY
I'm screaming out
Somebody listen
It feels so good
This therapy

I lost control and hurt myself
I knew deep down I needed some help
The self abuse it would not stop
No matter how hard I tried
So I lied and I tried
And I pulled my life together
Am I going insane think again
I got so fuckin fed-up
With being unstable

NO MORE
I'm screaming out
This is my help
