DON'T LOOK BACK

I'm sorry for the things I said
I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry for the things I did
I did them just to spite you
I'm older and wiser now I see how I played the fool
I guess there's times in all our lives we
Can't Explain the things we do
Oh.
Don't look back and feel ashamed about how
Easily you played the game cause the past
Is something we can't change.
The world was closing in on me
Fighting for some space
Misdirected anger and it
Blew up in my face
Life's to short for regrets so I'll learn from
My mistakes, but how much fucking learning
Can one person take?
Oh.
There are things I'd like to say but pride
Has got my tongue, so I'll take the easy way out
And blame it on being young
Can't take back what's been said it's been way too long
Won't be haunted by the past I'm trying to move on
