CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION

Father looks down to his son 
says "I was like you when I was young" 
Son looks up to father's plans 
Works in the factory with his hands 

Says "I wanna be just like you, 
organize the work for the collective few" 
But as he grows up he sees no change 
Systems won't let you rearrange! 

Some day people will say 
"Do we have to live this way?" 
"Is this how we have to exist?" 
And the people will rise up, and resist! 

A majority class dominates 
A world that the lower class creats 
media confusion hides the fact 
that we work with the rich man's knife in our back 
we're killing ourselves for a profit gain 
a profit off life what a fucking shame 
we burn that flag for the values sworn 
some day we'll burn it to keep warm 

What we have done will not be lost 
to all eternity 
everything ripens at its time 
and becomes fruit eventually!
