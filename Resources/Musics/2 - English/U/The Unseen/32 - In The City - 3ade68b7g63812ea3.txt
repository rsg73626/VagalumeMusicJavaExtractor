IN THE CITY

down here we walk a little faster 
down here we grow up real tight 
down here we stick together 
because down here you've gotta fight 

can live off this country's waste 
we consume so much in this rat race 
(the city is a) human breeding ground of exploitation 
but I won't become jaded 

IN THE CITY 

it's capitalism at its best 
people living neck to neck 
their glass buildings won't fall on their own 
so we should be throwing stones! 

IN THE CITY 

some of us were born here 
some of us were brought here 
some of us have moved here 
but none of us can leave here 

IN THE CITY
