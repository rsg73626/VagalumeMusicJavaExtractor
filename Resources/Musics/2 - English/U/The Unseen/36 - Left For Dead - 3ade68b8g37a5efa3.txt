LEFT FOR DEAD

We're left for dead if we don't try.
We're left for dead if we don't try.
We're left for dead if we don't try.
We're left for dead if we don't try.

10-26-2005 it marked the day 2000 soldiers died
We all live in fear, day after day
As global warming is on the way
Put a bullet in your gun
And point it at your head
Sometimes it seems like we're already dead
And new orleans suffered devastation
And from the graves the dead have risen

Sometimes it seems we're left for dead
So much hopelessness and destruction
We must rise up, open our eyes.
Make a change before we die.
We're left for dead if we don't try.

Plane strikes the target, was there a bomb?
Detonation leads to crumbling.
See the hole in the wall of the pentagon
Bodies gone, no bones or metal remains.
We all got a righ, a right to choose
Interpret what we see on the news
Religious war and racial hatred
The truth is fucking suffocated

Sometimes it seems we're left for dead
So much hopelessness and destruction
We must rise up, open our eyes.
Make a change before we die.
We're left for dead if we don't try.

Well can't you see it's fucking getting darker everyday?
How long can our world subsist?
When ill the madness subside?
Will extinction rain down from the sky?
3, 2, 1, now or anytime, we could all die.
We're left for dead if we don't try.
Poisoned or pure.
It's left for dead if we don't try.
There's no escape, ha.
We're left for dead if we don't try.
The poor, the rich are left for dead if we don't try.

Sometimes it seems we're left for dead
So much hopelessness and destruction
We must rise up, open our eyes.
Make a change before we die.
We're left for dead if we don't try.
