GOODBYE AMERICA

yeah everything bothers me 
just about everything that i see 
no need for a flag or a country 
raise your finger if you agree 

the problems won't go away 
if we keep our rage at bay 
the filth and slime will always stay 
if we choose to ignore and play 

goodbye america! fuck you america! goodbye america! fuck you! 

the stars and strips are prison bars 
they won't let you get too far 
the rule over many by the few 
you cant police my mind because i won't let you 

Goodbye america, fuck you america 
goodbye america, fuck you! 

pledge allegence to your self 
not greed, power, war, and wealth 
remember you were born a human being 
not a part of their machine 

Good bye america, fuck you america 
Goodbye america, fuck you! 

NO MORE SOCIAL ORDER!
