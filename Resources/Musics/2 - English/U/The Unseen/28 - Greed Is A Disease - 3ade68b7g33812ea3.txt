GREED IS A DISEASE

if you're sick and disease stricken 
the system's got a cure that you're not getting 
getting unless you're one of the elite 
and that's the only way that your illness can be beat 
with a nice insurance policy their eyes will light up 
these rich bastard doctors are shady and corrupt 

to make a million dollars off of someone's pain 
those heartless fuckin' bastards have no fuckin' shame 
medicines and treatments they should all be free 
but that will never happen in our society 

if your broke, unhappy they take you in 
if your heavily insured you should see their fuckin' grin 
as you pop your pills, they pop their champaigne 
as your paying off your debt, they're boarding a plane 
your misfortune pays for their vacation 
and the million dollar homes they resign in 
they don't care about your health, only their wallets 
their greed is a disease and we gotta stop it 

greed is a disease
