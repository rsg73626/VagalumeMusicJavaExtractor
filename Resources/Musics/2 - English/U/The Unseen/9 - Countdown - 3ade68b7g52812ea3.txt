COUNTDOWN

Countdown! to my extinction, my life falls apart in front of my face
Countdown! my life is such a disgrace
Countdown! should I hang myself or slit my wrist
Countdown! overdose on heroin, just like Sid

My life means nothing to me,
can't wait until I'm fuckin dead I can't stand this life any more,
wait 'till I blow off my head

Countdown! always got problems, can't seem to escape
Countdown! the lies you feed me are so fuckin fake
Countdown! can't put up with life's daily pressure
Countdown! suicide will be self expression
