I DON'T CARE

Blood on the hands, blood on the face
Last chance left for the human race
Forgotten heroes, fallen gods
The world we built is gonna fall

I don't care what you think

Hate the power they've abused
Punks stand alone, stand accused
Watch your back, watch your friends
Don't give in 'till the bitter end

I don't care what you think
