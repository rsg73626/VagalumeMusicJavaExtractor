NO EVACUATION

chaos chaos hear that sound 

when the time comes what are you gonna do? 
when the sirens blow, 10 seconds of chaos 
is it your regret? does it matter anyway? 
when the poisons come from all around 

no evacuations 

for a split second weâ€™re all the same 
nothing to lose, nothing to gain 
no classes, money, or politics 
just flesh and blood and eyes of fire 
all those years of fucking pain 
all those years of suffering 
are wasted away 

when the bomb is dropped 
and the button is pushed 
there is no second chance 
your nations on fire 
youâ€™re going down
