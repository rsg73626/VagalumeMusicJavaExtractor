ALONE

not gonna explain myself to the likes of you 
tired of feeling sorry for feeling the way i do 
ive heard that you cant please everybody on this earth 
so from now on im putting myself first 

doing what you know to be right, fuck everybody else 
doing what you feel to be right, you only got yourself 

never turn your back on friends that are true 
sooner or later it comes down to you 
stand up for yourself and what you believe 
as long as you're true to yourself, theres nothing you cant achieve! 

there comes a time when you may find yourself down and beaten 
NO HOPE, NO FUTURE, total utter abandon 
but you gotta take control, rise up outta nothing 
only you can help yourself, your strength comes from within 

have pride in nothing, cause nothing is sacred.
