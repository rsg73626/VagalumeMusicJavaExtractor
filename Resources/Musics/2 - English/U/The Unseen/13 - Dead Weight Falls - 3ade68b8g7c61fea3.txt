DEAD WEIGHT FALLS

Friends like you who needs enemies
Dead weight falls set you free 

Stabbed in the back time time again.
Life goes on learn to embrace the pain. 
Dealt with it so much but it was never enough.
Now your set free my wounds healing up.

Time to face reality
Dead weight falls and it sets you free

Can't stand this atrocity
Dead weight falls and it sets you free
Let's end this hypocrisy
Dead weight falls and it sets you free
Nothing left can't you see
The dead weight falls

Severed ties are we friends 
Well friends don't lie, cheat or steal
Is that what you are? Well good for you
I'll get a knife and stab you too. 

Time to face reality
Dead weight falls and it sets you free
Can't stand this atrocity
Dead weight falls and it sets you free
Let's end this hypocrisy
Dead weight falls and it sets you free
With friends like you, well I now see
Who needs enemies

No apologies or consideration
Dead weight, dead weight
You never pitch in but you're always taking
Dead weight, dead weight
I've been strung along time to cut the string

Dead weight, dead weight
Dead weight falls and it sets you free
Last chorus same as 1st chorus
