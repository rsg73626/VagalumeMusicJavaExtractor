POLICE BRUTALITY

No Authority!
I've spoke my mind a thousand times
You can resist peacefully 'till the end of time
There's a point where you reach an end of thought
And the thought turns to action, emotion takes control!

Authority! No Authority! Fuck Authority!
Police Brutality!

Politicians are pigs in business suits
Triangle of power, the good are few
If terrors what you represent
TERRORS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET!

Authority! No Authority! Fuck Authority!
Police Brutality!

First word learned was the word no!
