D.I.Y.

We are the punks of today, we are the punks of tomorrow
We will fight for what is right, we will fight to live our lives
We fight regardless of what you say
Look around at what we've created, take a good look at the scene

Build something from nothing, we gave it meaning
DIY or die, look out for everyone, concentrate on having fun
We can't fight each other, gotta try to stick together
That's how we'll keep the scene strong

The whole thing is still very young, its only been 20 years
We are the third generation, save the world from annihilation
With our silly punk rock anthems.
