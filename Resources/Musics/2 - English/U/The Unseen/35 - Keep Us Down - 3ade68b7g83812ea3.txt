KEEP US DOWN

No One wants to book us for reasons we don't know
Maybe because we look funny
Think nobody will go to the show
We're just a bunch of fuckin' kids
Workin' hard and getting shit
Don't ignore us, think we'll go away
Fuck off you dick, we're here to stay

You can't keep us down

Just when things are going good, we get kicked in the face
Our fuckin shows get cancelled, our flyers are a fuckin' waste
Our band members get shipped away and leave me in the cold
We will fight to live on but this shit is getting old

Some of us believe in revolution
Some of us are straight edge
Some of us like to get piss drunk
Some of us just want to go to bed
We've got one common goal, you can't keep us down
Fuck your respect, fuck your money
Fuck you 'cause we're her to stay
