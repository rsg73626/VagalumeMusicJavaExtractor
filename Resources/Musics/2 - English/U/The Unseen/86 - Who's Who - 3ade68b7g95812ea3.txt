WHO'S WHO

Don't wear team coats, can't play ball.
Stare at me as I walk down the hall
Call me a fag
Say that I'm gay but who's the one getting laid?
Fuck you, who's who!

Don't like me, think I'm a mess
Don't like my hair, don't like my clothes
I can't fight but I'll bite off your nose

Don't like me 'cause the way I dress
Don't like me 'cause of your ignorance
Have different styles and different thoughts
Why don't you wake up before you get fuckin' dropped
