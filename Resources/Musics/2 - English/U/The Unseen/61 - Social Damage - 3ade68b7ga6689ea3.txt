SOCIAL DAMAGE

Social damage (x4)

You cant believe what you see
It's individuality
This world has made me who I am
But you can't comprehend
So you blindly consume their lies
Evil wears a great disguise
Have you no conscience man?
This is what made me who I am.

social damage
controls your thoughts
No minds of your own
So you blindly march(you blindly march

Live like this till the end
Your lives i'll never understand
I know I come from nothing
You're all irrelevant to me
And I dont want your help
I hope you burn in hell
Live by your own rules, don't pretend
Yah zombies blindly follow trends

(CHORUS)

Cant you see yourself
Just like every one else
You're trapped inside this mirror
Nobody wants to break out
(Break out x3)


(CHORUS)

Someone tell me whose controlling all these marionettes
