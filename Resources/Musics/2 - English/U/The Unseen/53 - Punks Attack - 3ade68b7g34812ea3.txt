PUNKS ATTACK

they all claimed we'd go away 
we grow in numbers everyday 
rebellion can't be quelled for long 
someday we'll come back twice as strong 
while your pockets are getting thick 
you're gonna get a brick 
when it's time for you to die 
i'll look you right in the eye 

when the punks attack we'll have your back 
20 years ago and we ain't done shit 
when the punks attack you better watch your back 
'cause there's a brick with your name on it 

this isn't just an idle threat 
i swear you ain't seen nothing yet 
lets keep the feeling on the street 
where it belongs, it's where we meet 
the youth are selling drugs, commiting crime 
but that will only get you time 
direct your anger towards their hate 
i'm pro-violent against the state 

you're gonna get yours too 
you'll get whats coming to you
