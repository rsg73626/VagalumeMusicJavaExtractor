THERE'S STILL HOPE

mistreated due to color of skin 
how did this injustice fucking begin? 
this terror's ensued for thousands of years 
this terror's created millions of tears 

all is not lost 
there's still hope 

we're throwing bricks and making noise 
but the target's so big the bricks feel like toys 
and when we shout they don't hear a word we say 
but i'll never shutup and i'll never behave 

revolution beings when you look within 
so let not a word slip from your little white lip 

my dreams got shattered when i finally came to learn 
that people are so cruel and the power is so firm 
mass organization has to be the key 
but is there hope of unity?
