TRADITION

you cling to an old world, of morals of a long past age 
why is it hard to accept that things have changed? 

you swallowed every word without and question 
followed all you heard for the sake of tradition 

say that your religious but your faith just ain't true 
you salute a flag without asking what it did for you 

you've been spoon feed your every thought 
always did just as your taught 
you have a right to think that way 
but i question you integrity 
alwasy forcing your views on me 
but they're just slogans it's plain to see 

fuck tradition
