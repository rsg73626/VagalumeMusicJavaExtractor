STAND UP AND FIGHT

the 90's are almost over and hatred still runs deep 
ignorant fucks in police suits still rule the fucking streets 
the poor getting poorer while the rich stay fucking rich 
equality is no where in sight if you wanna win you gotta fight 

stand up and fight 

what the hell are we supposed to do? 
violence and despair are threating to destory the youth 
everyday on the news more murder more rape 
we're living in a dying world from which there's no escape 

what the hell are we supposed to do? 
what the fuck are we gonna do? 
living in a violent world with no hope for the youth
