GIVE IN TO HATE

violence surround me 
violence in society 
violence in our eyes 
violence in their cries 
violence it's our fate? 
violence it's too late? 
violence no escape? 
violence give in to hate? 

is it human nature to act like animals? 
we're all guilty, we're all criminals 
selfish species headed for a self destruction 
violent product of a moral corruption 

violence for love 
violence because of hate 
violence revoultion 
violence of the state 
violence you will find 
violence it grips your mind 
violence it's too late? 
violence give in to hate?
