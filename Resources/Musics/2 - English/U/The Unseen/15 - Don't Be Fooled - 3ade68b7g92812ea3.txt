DON'T BE FOOLED

resist, rebel, stand up for yourself 
they will try to bring you down 
one day those tables will be turned around 
we'll spit back in their face screaming "fuck the human race" 
their oppression has fucked us for so long 
then they say to rebel is wrong 
don't believe them our rebellion ain't wrong no! 

stand defiant, don't be fooled 
don't let anyone tell you what you do rebellion is natural 

when you're born they're telling you what to do 
schools force their beliefs on you 
say our ideals are just a phase, you'll grow out of it and cat your age 
but i don't want you society, fuck a culture that rejects me 
still i don't want the american dream, this "teen angst" don't die at 19
