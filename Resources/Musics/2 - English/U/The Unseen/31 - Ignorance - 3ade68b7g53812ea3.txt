IGNORANCE

Fuck that punk rock clone, you aint punk if you got a home
Forget that punk rock rule, gotta be like me to be cool
Go ahead, leave me alone, aint you got a life of your own?

The way you look just aint right
Don't care if it is your life, trying to tell you how to be
Trying to make you just like me
