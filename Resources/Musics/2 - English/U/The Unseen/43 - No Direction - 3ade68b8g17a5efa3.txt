NO DIRECTION

Madness I can't escape
Frenzy running rampant through my mind
How much more can you take when you have no...

No direction

All these years of living life on the run
Can leave you mentally or physically scarred
You're forced to sacrifice far more than you get
So many memories I'll never forget
To get ahead you gotta stand up and fight
They say you're wrong but you know that you're right
It's an uphill battle till the bitter end
Keep on swingin' gotta fight to win

Madness I can't escape
Frenzy running rampant through my mind
How much more can you take when you have no...

On my way to no destination
Living chaos and confusion
Disorder's all you have
The end is so uncertain
On my way to no destination
Living chaos and confusion
Disorder's all you have
The end is so uncertain

A life sentence with no escape
And now you're feeling so devoid of faith
Some things must be learned all alone
Nowhere to turn so where do you go?
It's a thin rope that you're forced to walk
If you fall then you better rise up
You came from nothing and when it ends
It dissipates, nobody wins

Madness I can't escape
Frenzy running rampant through my mind
How much more can you take when you have no...

On my way to no destination
Living chaos and confusion
Disorder's all you have
The end is so uncertain
On my way to no destination
Living chaos and confusion
Disorder's all you have
The end is so uncertain

Life spins just like a chamber
And we all go sooner or later
Damage is irreversible
That cycle spins around and around
Life spins just like a chamber
And we all go sooner or later
Damage is irreversible
That cycle spins around and around

Not telling what you'll find
Take along hard look and try
This is a state of discontent
Seems there's no destination
Run rampant till this day
I got so much more to say
Crossroads of life and death
The end is so uncertain
