RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES

Can't you see it's right before your eyes
(Your eyes)

The moon's becoming red
It's foreshadowing the end
It's right before our eyes
We just choose not to care

Like and engine that has seized
Theirs no more air to breathe
We've lost the right to live
Through carelessness and greed

We rest eternally

Darkness fills the air
The time has come
It's one mass grave
This is our fate

Overcome by brutal heat
This worlds now obsolete
The storm has killed the calm
Violence silence ends the cries
Crossroads of life and death
Extinction nothings left
From sea to shining sea
No more hatred, crime, disease

So now we reset eternally

Gasp your last breath
As we melt away
You can scream for help
It's hell to pay
And you're to blame
