SENT TO DIE

i'm never gonna fight for this corrupt country 
i never have, i never will 
it's never done fucking anything for me 
never! 
i won't fight a war to power your wealth 
fuck your power and your wealth 
'cause everyday i'm at war with myself 
a never ending fucking war 

war! 
sent to die are you free? 
you murder, you're brainwashed 
destroy their enemy 
destroy, shoot, kill the enemy 

i don't care about your senseless war 
war! 
or the fucked up shit your fighting for 
i never had, i never will 
millions die but the war will pass 
do you really wanna die 
fighting senseless wars for the upper class 
your pain and torture is their gain 

do you wanna die?
