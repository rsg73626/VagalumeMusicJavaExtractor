LET IT GO

For too long we've scoffed at the actions of the rest of the world, 
but what do we have to show for all our arrogance? 
Division, mistrust, and betrayal plague us just as badly as it does them. 
And when it's time for action, 
when it's finally our turn will we let petty difference divide us 
like it has time and time again or will we be able to rise up and let it all go?

We stand on the brink of leadership to inherit an urban waste.
The fruits of their of their failure are thrust in our mouths but we can't stand the taste.
Do we turn our backs on the mess they've made and blame it all on their greed?
Or do we stand together, proud and tall, where they failed can we succeed?
Where they failed will we succeed... Go!

These problems aren't our doing, but we inherit them at birth.
This suffering's not a legacy but a chance to prove our worth
So we fight against oppression and we pledge to do our part (Hey Hey)
Revolution's not born of bullets but from the fire in our hearts (It's in our hearts)

The will is there and the feeling is strong, but the messages seem lost.
We divide ourselves from one another, and then ignore the final costs.
Lyrics and slogans are not battle cries they're just ideas and nothing more.
Talk without actions is politics for fashion so check your ego at the door.
I can't take no more... No!

These problems aren't our doing, but we inherit them at birth.
This suffering's not a legacy but a chance to prove our worth
So we fight against oppression and we pledge to do our part (Hey Hey)
Revolution's not born of bullets but from the fire in our hearts (It's in our hearts)

The wars they wage and the problems they made, they now belong to us.
Will we let them rule us too or will we crush them into dust?
The choice is ours and the lines are drawn so it's time to pick your side.
Will you stand for the greater good or protect your battered pride?

Whoa, time to let it go (Let go, let go) [x4]
Time to let it go.
