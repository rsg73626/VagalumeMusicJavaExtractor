THE ANGER AND THE TRUTH

where's the anger? 

there comes a day when you finally realize 
that everything you've been taught was a fucking lie 
they always said that you should always tell the truth 
do as I say, but don't do as I do 

where's the anger? 
where's the fucking truth? 
did you lose it somewhere in your youth? 

sometimes it's hard to see the enemy 
the left, the right, or the fence of apathy 
the sheep or the wolf, it's a thinly veiled disguise 
movements are worthless if they're plagued with lies
