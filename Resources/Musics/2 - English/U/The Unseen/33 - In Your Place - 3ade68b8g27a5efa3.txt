IN YOUR PLACE

(in your place) you give your soul
Feel no disgrace
Seems like they spit right in your face
Day after day
It's nothing new
Paranoia (ha ha)
What can you do
It seems so mundane

You tried your best
Got nothing left
Where do you go from here?
It seems no one cares
Yeah that's how it appears

You tried so hard to shine,
But it just seems like every time
You get a shot, you just get pushed
Back in your place...(2x)
Go.....

And in the end what do you get?
The hollow stares are so priceless
A room so eager just to exit
Five minutes are gone
Sacrifice, devotion killed
Bands hypnotized by dollar bills
And kids love what's deemed hip
To the public

So when you try your best
You think you got nothing left
Don't let them push you
Shove them back

Put a end to this charade
A rated g horror parade
Make up and skulls are such a scream
This fad can't last another week

And when you try your best
You think you got nothing left
Don't let them push you
Shove them back

Back in your place
The end results the same
And its so clear to me
From the blank stares
That you don't care at all
