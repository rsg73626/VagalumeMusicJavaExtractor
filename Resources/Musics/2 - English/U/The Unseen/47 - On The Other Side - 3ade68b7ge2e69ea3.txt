ON THE OTHER SIDE

Pondering on your existence
You wonder why you are alive
Suffering from severe depression
Contemplating suicide
You're told your nothing, unimportant
You only see their life through your eyes
Well every life has it's own problems
If you can see the other side

Stumble and fail

Stumble and fail or reach the sky
You'll never know unless you try
Dealt misery while some are blessed
Who measures failure what is success

A part of you is gone and dead yah
But it just won't leave your head
So you try to push it all away all away
Take it all day after day
Theirs only darkness at the end
Will your soul wonder or descend
Is this how it's supposed to be
Can you control your own, own destiny

Stumble and fail or reach the sky
You'll never know unless you try

Yahhhh will you be free
Or suffer endless misery
Yahhhh will you be free
Or you suffer, suffer endlessly
