TSUNAMI SUICIDE

These feelings in my head
Of things that can't be said
Because I'm grasping for the words
To make you understand
And I wanna destroy myself
Don't wanna destroy myself
I wanna destroy myself
Hurricanes of love and pain
Tsunami tides of suicide
Like a cobra poised to strike
Like a criminal in the night
Depression sleeping in
Like a ship without a light
But life is just a game
And we all end up the same
So let the storms come
Cause the clouds will bring the rain
