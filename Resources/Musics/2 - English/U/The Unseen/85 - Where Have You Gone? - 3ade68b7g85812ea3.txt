WHERE HAVE YOU GONE?

Iâ€™ve seen so many kids over the years 
a few years come and go and they disappear 
punk rock is not a trend its a fucking life style 
yet so many fade out after a while 
when you grew up and deserted the scene 
found the american nightmare is the american dream 
your ideas changes as you matured and grew 
the system you despised now controls you 

where have you gone? 
you faded away 

you faded away, now youâ€™re gone 

so many scream the kids are united 
then they grow up and become divided 
donâ€™t look down on us, cause we wonâ€™t change like you 
who gave you the right to write the rules 
work five days a week and you slave nine to five 
well half your life you lived a lie 
I thought I knew you, man I was fooled 
you have gone and let the system trap you
