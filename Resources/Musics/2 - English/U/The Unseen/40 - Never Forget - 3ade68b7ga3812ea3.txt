NEVER FORGET

its the dead of night and she wakes up screaming 
but her terror doesnâ€™t end when sheâ€™s done dreaming 
she recloses her eyes and all she sees is your face 
bringing her back to that time and that place 
when you forced your way into her front door 
you took all her possessions, still you wanted more 
grabbed her by the arms, forced her to the bed 
you left her body but youâ€™ll never leave her head 

never forget, never walk away 
pain, regret, till her dying day 

he was very young but he knew when to hide 
he didnâ€™t recognize the smell booze 
but could see it in your eyes 
he swore when he was older heâ€™d get his revenge 
but he never got the chance cause you left when he was ten 
now he walks the street with hatred in his eyes 
a needle in his veins, a head so full of lies 
all his wounds have healed, scars still mark the flesh 
drugs numb the pain but heâ€™ll never forget 

how do you sleep at night? 
what gave you the right 
destroying peopleâ€™s lives 
only their pain will survive 

never forget
