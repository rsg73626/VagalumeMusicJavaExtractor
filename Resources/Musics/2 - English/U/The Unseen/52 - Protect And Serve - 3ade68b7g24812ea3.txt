PROTECT AND SERVE

Hate, hate building up for hours
That's their side, this one's ours
Blood and fists vs. total power
They didn't run, not fuckin' cowards

It's gonna blow,
it's gonna blow,
it's gonna blow,
it's gonna blow

Riot in NYC, how did this begin?
Riot in NYC, riot all the punks & skins!
Fight back, fight back we can't sit and watch
Innocent people, our friends get beat up by the cops

It's gonna blow,
it's gonna blow,
it's gonna blow,
it's gonna blow

Protect and serve,
protect and serve,
protect and serve,
protect and serve.
