COINCIDENCE OR CONSEQUENCE?

you have a job but you can't afford the rent 
why is life always just dollars and cents? 
if you can't get a job then you can't get a home 
the vicious cycle spawns and turns your soul to bone 

kill, kill, die, die, death, death, suicide 
why do you think those rates are so high? 
do you think it's just a coincidence that the black male 
is the highest statistic trapped on welfare? 

landlord system, life for rent 
capitalism doesn't make any sense 
don't join the system, it's suicide! 
coincidence or consequence: you decide! 

kill, kill, die, die, death, death, suicide 

welfare is warfare
