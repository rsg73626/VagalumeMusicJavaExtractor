THE SYSTEM'S DESTRUCTION

Smash the government smash the state
You feed the system you claim to hate
They get us all though corruption
Cause we will pay to feed addiction
Alcohol tobacco meat
Countless others they know we need
Never fall know we’re weak
Know we’ll pay to power their greed

Never meet their destruction
Because we support the system

Fuck the state, what a joke
They make money off the butts you smoke
Smash the government is looking bleak

They take our money every week
Destroy their power is kind of tough
If you can’t stand up if your too fucked up
Drink the booze they supply
Never win now you know why

Never meet their destruction
Because we support the system
