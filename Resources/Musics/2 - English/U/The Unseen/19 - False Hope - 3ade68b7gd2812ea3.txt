FALSE HOPE

you're expecting one well here it comes 
it's all been said it's all been done
this world will never change 
so i hope it burns down

you're expecting one well here it comes 
it's all been said it's all been done
well fuck the government, fuck the world
i hope they all burn down
i despise the government
and nothing's getting solved 
you think you're so fucking right 
well think once for yourself

( chorus )
try all you want 
nothing's getting solved
false hope

i have not changed my views
butevery band reports the same news
so let them tell you punks not dead
maybe they can get ahead
is that the subject you wanna hear
nothing's changed but the years
don't wanna repeat someone else's lines
that's such a waste of time
( chorus )

you can try all you want to 
but nothing's getting solved
(repeat 3X)

you can try all you want to 
you can try all you want!!!!!!!!!!

( chorus )
