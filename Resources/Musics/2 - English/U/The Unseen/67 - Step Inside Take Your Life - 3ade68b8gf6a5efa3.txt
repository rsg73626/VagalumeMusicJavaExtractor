STEP INSIDE TAKE YOUR LIFE

Step inside!
Step inside!
Step inside!

(you never know unless you try!)

You're entering a door way
A gate way to death,
Don't stay on earth come with me
And take your final breath,
No more pain and torture,
It's time to give them some
They'll wish they never picked on you
Your time has fucking come,

Will you step inside
Come on in and take you life
(kill yourself)
Will you step inside
As you take your fucking life

Your standing in a doorway
But are you coming in
You pains become pleasure
Commit your final sin,
There's no heaven from suicide
That what they always say,
You've done so much wrong,
You won't go there anyway

Will you step inside
Come on in and take you life
(kill yourself)
Will you step inside
As you take your fucking life

(you'll never know unless you try)

Razor blades across tender flesh
You wanna see whats on the other side,
Fun to your head
Close you eyes
You wanna see whats on the other side,
Rope around your neck
On the edge of a seat
You wanna see whats on the other side

Wits end, cant sleep,
Will you be at peace
On the other side,
Is it a promise
Or just another threat!
