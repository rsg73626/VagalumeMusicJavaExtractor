FLAMES HAVE DESTROYED

You walk the path, now deal with it: the problems you have made.
Go prove to them that you have changed, so memories can fade.
The tide's coming in... but will it wash away the times?
The times you disappointed them, the times you made them cry.
Where can you turn? The flames have destroyed.
Yah, can you rebuild the bridge that you burned?
The patience to reconstruct... or let the ashes wash away?
YAH!!!. Fight for what you want, let nothing stand in your way!.
