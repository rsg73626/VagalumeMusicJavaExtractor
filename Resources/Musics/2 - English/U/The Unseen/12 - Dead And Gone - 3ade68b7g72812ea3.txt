DEAD AND GONE

you were a violent drunk but now your dead and gone 
you were ruining my life the damage had been caused 
on the day of your funeral my life was reborn 

the first time i saw you i could sense bad luck 
it was eleven a.m. as you were drinking on my couch 
and then you moved in like a terrential rain storm 
you had nowhere to go but i knew where you were goin' 

you smiled when i was home but you abused when i was gone 
you hit my younger brothers and then you'd taunt me 
and when i would confront you you'd say it was a lie 
well i was at your funeral happy that you died 

dead and gone 

that night in the kitchen i trashed my house 
there was a fist fight and i threw you out 
and you were loaded with no place to go 
so you passed out and blacked out in the snow 
we got a phone call saying that you were dead 
all the shit you put me through raced through my head 
you died on a dirty motel floor 
now you can't make me suffer anymore 

do you see what i see 
you were a violent drunk 
you were ruining my life 
the damage you have caused 
on the day of your funeral 
my life was reborn
