SOMETHING TO SAY

I've got something to say 
and I just can't fucking hold it anymore 
it means more to me today 
then it ever fucking did before 
I'm a punk 
and I've finally learned what it means to me 
it doesn't dictate who I am 
I define what the word means 

I ain't ever scared to say 
I'm proud to be where I am today 
always follow your dreams 
if I ever cared what people say 
I wouldn't be who I am today 
be yourself to be free 

use destruction 
it's the only way to pave salvation 
but don't forget creation 
it's the REAL history of this nation 
hate and fear your government 
because what they steal is your onlycovenant 
love your land, your nation 
but don't forget theres a whole world out there waiting 

be yourself to be free
