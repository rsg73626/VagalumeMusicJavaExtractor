JADED

Always saying the system sucks
But its people like you who fuck it up
Always saying we need to change
Look at the problem we’re all to blame

Always pointing an accusing finger
You were here first you did it better
Sit in the back with folded arms
Kids today don’t know the cause

Revolt you scream and yell
Can’t change a country gotta start with yourself
