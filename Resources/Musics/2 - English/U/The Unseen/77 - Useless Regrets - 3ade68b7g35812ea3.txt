USELESS REGRETS

Useless Regrets
Useless Regrets
Useless Regrets
Useless Regrets
Got the demon in my veins,
Crawling blind and my head's a wreck
Wear it like a badge (of honor) on our chest,
But it's more like a noose wrapped around my neck
The more I fight the tighter it gets,
Cutting off my air and I can't breathe
Like the siren's song so innocent,
Till you're it's victim and cannot leave (so we)
Raise a glass to poor decisions,
Broken hearts, and blurred vision
This can't last forever
Everybody's got their own story
