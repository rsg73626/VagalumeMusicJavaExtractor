WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

Been a while since I've seen any constructive ideas.
Nothig new, "smash the state! smash the hate! smash the fear!" alright now, 
how about coming off that cloud. put in prespective.
Let's start small 
If we're not going to come together and be a sizeable force,
we're going to have to start out small and build it more and more.
let's use an old idea and start our own comunity.
we must work TOGETHER. 
if we are to work towards living free. 

They must think it's all a joke. 
We laugh at them and they laugh right back. 
We talk and talk and talk and yell. 
But is there any chance of attack? 

This is not a selfish act of "fuck the rest of the world" think about 
it for a second, if our commune could he heard, production would 
be high since everything'd be free. we could feed and cloth the 
starving of the poorest countries. 
development would rocket, setting examples for the world! 
stateswould loose suport when they see what we've unfurled. our 
sectionalist anarchy could overcome the factions. 
the masses will not try it unless they see it put to action! 
IS THERE ANY YOUTH LEFT IN THE CULTURE? 
IS THERE ANY CULTURE LEFT IN THE YOUTH? 
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? THEM?
