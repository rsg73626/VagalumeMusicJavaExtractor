MY OWN DESTRUCTION

it's late to remember
this thing almost destroyed my mind
i don't know where my way goes
i only know one day everyone will die

and i'm sorry
was my fault
was my option
i did my own destruction

why are you looking ate me by this way?
i know you think i'm the scum of the world
and i don't blame you
'cos i am the guilty of everything

tell me a story
tell me your secret
tell me your option
i did my own destruction.
