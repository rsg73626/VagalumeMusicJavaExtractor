SONG WITHOUT NAME

conexion
plug the wire
and let the rain fall
creativity
crazy ideas
and the color black

don't worry with clouds
and let the rain fall
our sheeps are running to the mountains
but they will come back in the early morning

and the blur in my eyes...
help me i can't see
help me, don't let me alone in the dark.
