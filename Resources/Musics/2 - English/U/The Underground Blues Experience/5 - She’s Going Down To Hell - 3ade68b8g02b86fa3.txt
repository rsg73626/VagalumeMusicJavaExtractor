SHEâ€™S GOING DOWN TO HELL

she's going down to hell
i don't know anyway to stop her
she's going to be a bad woman
and her game is over

she's left you, pal
and i don't blame her
she's hearing terrible voices
and i feel pain on my tooth

i see a light
and it gave me a stairway
i'll follow you
wherever you'll go.
