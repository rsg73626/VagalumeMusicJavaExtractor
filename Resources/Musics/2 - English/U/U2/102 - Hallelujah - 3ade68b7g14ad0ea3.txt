HALLELUJAH

I heard there was a secret chord
That David played to pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you
It goes like this, the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
Well I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken, Hallelujah

Hallelujah...

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my lips, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
