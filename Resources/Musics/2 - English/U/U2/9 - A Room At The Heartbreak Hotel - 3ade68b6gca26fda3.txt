A ROOM AT THE HEARTBREAK HOTEL

 
From where I stand
I can see through you
From where you're sitting pretty one
I know it got to you.

I see the stars in your eyes
You say you want the truth but you need the lies
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino
You give your life for rock'n'roll.

Stand, we're on a landslide of love
You got everything you want
But what you need you give away
For primitive love and a ride on a mystery train
A primitive love.
A room at the heart, the heartbreak hotel.
A room at the heartbreak, heartbreak hotel.

You say it's love, it's not the money
You let them suck your life out like honey
Turning tricks you're on the street
Selling your kisses so bittersweet.

For primitive love and a ride on a mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heartbreak, heartbreak hotel.
