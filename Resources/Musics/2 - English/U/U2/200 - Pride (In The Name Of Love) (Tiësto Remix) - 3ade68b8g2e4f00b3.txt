PRIDE (IN THE NAME OF LOVE) (TIÃ‹STO REMIX)

In the name of love

One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come, he to justify
One man to overthrow

In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love

Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

In the name of love

In the name of love

In the name of love

In the name of love
