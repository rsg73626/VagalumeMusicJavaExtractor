CARTOON WORLD

Mr Bourke is off to work
He carries papers in his carrier bag
Mr Postman takes his bag back
Those angry dogs, those angry dogs

It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world

Mrs Brown is off to town
She carries shopping in her shopping bag
Mr Brown is working hard
For some degree at university

It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It really is
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world

Uncle Tony hates a drag
He didn't give me a lot of time, dear
Jack and Jill go up the hill
They dropped some acid and popped some pills
(Last line sometimes sung as "to pick some flowers and pop some pills")

It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon
