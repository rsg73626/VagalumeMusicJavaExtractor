LAST NIGHT ON EARTH (SINGLE VERSION)

She feels the ground is giving way
But she thinks we're better off that way
The more you take the less you feel
The less you know the more you believe
The more you have the more it takes today

You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)
You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)
You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)

She knows just what she's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth

She's not waiting on a saviour to come
She's at the bus-stop with News of the World and the Sun
Sun, here it comes
She's not waiting for anyone

You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)
You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)
You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)

She don't care what it's worth
But she's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth

Slipping away
(Would you believe in something
Would you believe in someone)
 
Slip slide
She lets me
Slipping away

(Would you believe in something
Would you believe in someone)
 
The world turns
And we get dizzy
Slipping away

(Would you believe in something
Would you believe in someone)

She's living, living next week now
You know she's going to pay it back somehow
She hasn't been to bed in a week
She'll be dead soon then she'll sleep

You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)
You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)
You got to give it away
(You got to give it away)

She already knows it hurts
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth
Last night on earth
Last night...
