NATIVE SON

Yeah it's on the street 
It's under your feet 
It's everywhere 
But if you're looking for free 
Don't look at me 
My enemy became my country 

On the run 
Officer put down the gun 
Native son 
I never wanted to own one 
Native son 
Both of us want to be someone 
It's so hard is it so hard for a native son 
To be free? 

Tears fallen from the sky 
Fallen to the ground 
Bullets start to fly 
He's hurt he's in the dirt 
On my word 
I did not take his lie 

Don't want to run away 
This isn't in my father's plans 
I know I can't stay 
If I stay I know what's next 

On the run 
Officer put down the gun 
Native son 
I never wanted to own one 
Native son 
All of us want to be someone 
It's so hard is it so hard for a native son 
To be free? 

Yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah 

Free... 

On the run 
Officer put down the gun 
Native son 
I never wanted to own one 
Native son 
Both of us want to be someone 
It's so hard is it so hard for a native son 
To be free?
