UNCHAINED MELODY

Oh my love
my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea (yeah)

Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me

Oh my love
my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine

I need your love
Ineed your love
God speed your love to me
