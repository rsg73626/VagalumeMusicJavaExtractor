LOVE AND PEACE OR ELSE

Lay down 
Lay down 
Lay your sweet lovely on the ground 
Lay your love on the track 
We''re gonna break the monster's back 
Yes we are… 
Lay down your treasure 
Lay it down now brother 
You don't have time 
For a jealous lover 

As you enter this life 
I pray you depart 
With a wrinkled face 
And a brand new heart 

I don't know if I can take it 
I'm not easy on my knees 
Here's my heart I'll let you break it 

I need some release, release, release 

We need 
Love and peace 
Love and peace 

Lay down 
Lay down your guns 
All your daughters of Zion 
All your Abraham sons 

I don't know if I can make it 
I'm not easy on my knees 
Here's my heart I'll let you break it 
I need some release, release, release 

We need 
Love and peace 
Love and peace 

Baby don't fight 
We can talk this thing through 
With me, me and you
I'll call on your phone 
The Tv is still on 
But the sound is turned down 
And the troops on the ground 
Are about to dig in 

And I wonder where is the love? 
Where is the love? 
Where is the love? 
Where is the love? 
Love and peace
