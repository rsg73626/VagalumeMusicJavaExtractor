LUMINOUS TIMES

Hey sister love
Hey sister soul
Hey, only love
Can turn me 'round tonight.
Hey sister love
Save my soul
Save my soul

Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Love won't let you go
Love won't let you go.
Hold onto love
See the sunshine in her song.

Hey sister love, hey sweet surrender

She comes like carnival
She is the big wheel
She turned my head around
She turned my head around
She is the speedway
She is the slipstream
She is coming 'round.

Hold on to love, hold on to love
Love won't let you go
Hold on to love, hold on to love
See the sunlight in her song
See the sunlight in her song.

She is the gun fire
She is the car crash
She is the avalanche
She is the thunder
She is the waves
And she pulls me under.

I love you 'cause I need to
Not because I need you
I love you 'cause I understand
That God has given me your hand
It holds me in a tiny fist
And still I need your kiss.

Hold on to love
Oh, see the sunlight in her song.
See the sunlight in her song, yeah!
