MERCY (VERSÃO WIDE AWAKE IN EUROPE)

I was drinking some wine
And it turned to blood
What’s the use of religion
If you’re any good

I know I’m weed killer, honey
You’re sugar
If you’re the prosecution
I get away with murder

You’re gravity searching for the ground
You're silence searching for a sound

Your heart is aching
Your heart is my home
It’s fascinating
I know I’ll never be alone

You wanna kill me and I wanna die
We were meant for each other, you and I
Like time in a bed of rust
Like the rhyme of love and lust

I'm not sorry, you’re not gonna cry
You put the blue back in my eye
It’s just us
Because, because, because we can
We must

If you’re hunger, baby let me feed it
If your heart is full, baby let me bleed it
And happiness is for
Those who don’t really need it
I know you love me too much

You wanna kill me and I wanna die
We’re a perfect match, you and I
Neither can we resist
And neither can we trust

I’m not sorry, you’re not gonna cry
You put the blue back in my eye
It’s just us
Because, because, because we can
We must

I'm in love
I'm laying down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You wanna kill me and I wanna die
We were meant for each other, you and I
Like time in a bed of rust
Like the rhyme of love and lust

I’m not sorry, you’re not gonna cry
You put the blue back in my eye
It’s just us
Because, because, because we can
We must
Because, because, because we can
We must
Because, because, because we can
We must
