DISCOTHEQUE (DM TEC RADIO MIX)

You can reach
But you can't grab it
You can hold it, control it
No, you can't bag it

You can push
But you can't direct it 
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it

You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie dovie stuff

(I... I... I can't)
(I... I... I can't)
(I... I... I can't)
(I... I... I can't)

You get confused
But you know it
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love
You don't always show it

Let's go
Let's go

Let's go
Let's go

Discotheque

You want to be the one
But you know you're someone else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you hearing, yeah

Love...
(Heaven in your heart)
(You want heaven in your heart)
Love...
(You want heaven in your heart)
(You want heaven in your heart)
(You want heaven in your heart)
Love...

It's not a trick
'Cause you can't learn it
It's the way you don't pay, that's okay
'Cause you can't earn it

You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie dovie stuff

Let's go
Let's go
Discotheque

Go go
Go go
