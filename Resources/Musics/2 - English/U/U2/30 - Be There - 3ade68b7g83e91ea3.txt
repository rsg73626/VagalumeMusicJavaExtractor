BE THERE

outtake do Ã¡lbum War

You don't have to break your heart
In two my love
You don't have to play a part
It's you I love
You don't have to hide from yourself
You don't have to be someone else again


You don't have to rescue me
You don't have to watch me drown
You don't have to give to me
All I want is you


Be there, my love
Be there, tonight
Be there, my love
Be there, tonight


You don't have to dress yourself up
Or stay the same
You don't have to smile
If I say smile


You don't have to be the best
You don't have to give me rest
All I want is all you have
Nothing else
Nothing


Be there, my love
Just be there, my love


If you want the whole of me
That's all you'll get
I'll sing this song
I'd give my health
Give it all
You don't have to...


Ah, she comes on by
She says, I need you, my love
Ah, she says, all I want is you


You don't have to play your little game
If I fall apart
You don't have to work those strings
Or do those things
You're enough in my heart


You don't have to hide from yourself
You don't have to be someone else
All I want is all you have
All I want is you


Be there, my love
Be there, tonight
Be there, my love
Be there, tonight
