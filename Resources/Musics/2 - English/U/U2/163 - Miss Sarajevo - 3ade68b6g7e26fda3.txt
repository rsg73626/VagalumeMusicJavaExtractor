MISS SARAJEVO

Is there a time for keeping your distance 
A time to turn your eyes away.
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day.

Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
Is there time for cutting hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear.

Here she comes, heads turn around
Here she comes, to take her crown.

Is there a time to run for cover
Is there a time for kiss and tell.
Is there a time for different colours
Different names you find hard to spell.

Is there a time for first communion
A time for East 17
Is there time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen.

Here she comes, beauty plays the clown
Here she comes, surreal in her crown.

Dici che il fiume trova la via al mare
Che come il fiume giungerai a me
Oltre i confini e le terre assetate
Dici che come fiume, Come fiume  
L'amore giungerà, l'amore
E non so più pregare
E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare.

Is there a time for tying ribbons
A time for Christmas trees.
Is there a time for laying tables
When the night is set to freeze.
