CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE

Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help, Falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help, Falling in love with you.

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling so it goes, somethings are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
Cause I can't help, Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
