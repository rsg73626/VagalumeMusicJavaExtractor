NUMB (THE SOUL ASSASSINS MIX)

One nine nine three
Soul Assassins come to deal with roughneck destruction


I feel numb


U2 come down with the matter of numb business


Top of the matter


Don't move
Don't talk out of time
Don't think
Don't worry everything's just fine
Just fine


Don't grab
Don't clutch
Don't hope for too much
Don't breathe
Don't achieve
Or grieve without leave


Don't check
Just balance on the fence
Don't answer
Don't ask
Don't try and make sense


I feel numb


Don't whisper
Don't talk
Don't run if you can walk
Don't cheat, compete
Don't miss the one beat


I feel numb


Don't travel by train
Don't eat
Don't spill
Don't piss in the drain
Don't make a will


Don't fill out any forms
Don't compensate
Don't cower
Don't crawl
Don't come around late
Don't hover at the gate


Don't take it on board
Don't fall on your sword
Just play another chord
If you feel you're getting bored


I feel numb


Don't be heavy
Don't be unkind
It's not that bad
Just try and unwind


I feel numb


Don't change your brand
Don't listen to the band
Don't ape
Don't gape
Don't change your shape
Have another grape


Come on, come on, hey
I feel numb
Come on, come on, hey
I feel numb
Come on, come on, hey
I feel numb
Come on, come on, hey
I feel numb
Come on, come on, hey
I feel numb
Come on, come on, hey
I feel numb
