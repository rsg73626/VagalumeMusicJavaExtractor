THE SAINTS ARE COMING (OUTRA VERS√ÉO)

There is a house in new orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And god, i know i'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone
how long now
Until the clouds unroll and you come home
the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent
your descent

I cried to my daddy on the telephone
how long now
Until the clouds unroll and you come home
the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent
your descent

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply

SOLO

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief
How long now
Until a weather change condemns belief
The stone says
This paternal guide once had his day
Once had his day

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
