MOFO

Lookin' for to save my soul
Lookin' in the places where no flowers grow
Lookin' for to fill that God shaped hole

Mother mother sucking rock and roll
Been around the back been around the front

Holy dunc, spacejunk comin' in for the splash
White dpoes on punk staring into the flash
Lookin' for baby Jesus under the trash

Mother mother suckin' rock and roll
Mother rock and roll

Mother am I still your son
You know I've waited for so long to hear you say so

Mother you left and made me someone
Now I'm still a child but no one tells me no

Lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world
Lookin' for the father of my two little girls
Got the swing got the sway got my straw in lemonade
Still looking for the face I had before the world was made

Mother mother sucking rock and roll
Bubble poppin' sugar droppin' rock and roll

Woo me sister
Move me brother
Soothe me mother
Rule me father
Show me mother
Days passin
Around each other
