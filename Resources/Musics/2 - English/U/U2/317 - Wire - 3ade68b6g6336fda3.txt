WIRE

 
Innocent and in a sense I am
Guilty of a crime that's now in hand.
Such a nice day to throw your life away.
Such a nice day, to let it go.

Cold in his eyes, I can't believe it.
Cold in his heart and soul.
Heart and soul.

Cold man, such a cold heart
Such a cold man, I watch you tear yourself apart.
So lay me down, my soul to keep.
So lay me down, the longest sleep.
Oh, the longest sleep.

In I come and out you go you get
Here we are again, now place your bets
Is this the time, the time to win or lose?
Is this the time, the time to choose?

Cold in his eyes, I can't believe it
So deep inside a cold fire.
Cold in his heart and soul.

Don't do it, d-d-don't do it
Don't do it, d-d-don't do it
Anytime you're on the earth… is kissing time.

You can't take me, that's right but you can keep me going.

It's so white trash if you've got the cash.
A cartoon cut out, a cut-throat let out.
Look I'm on your side, we're both right.
Hey, I'm alright Jack, just don't piggyback.
I'm no dope, I'll give you hope.
Here's the rope.
Here's the rope…
Now swing on it.
