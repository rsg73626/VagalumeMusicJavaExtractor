SLIDE AWAY

Are you gonna wake again? 
Are you gonna take it down? 
Oh babe, I don’t wanna deal it 
Oh, make it alright 
Gimme some, my love 
Away, Away, Away 
(Michael e Bono)
I just wanna slide away and come alive again 
I just wanna slide away and come alive again 
I will see that love again, and find a life again 
I just wanna slide away and come alive again 
(Bono)
I wanted to let it go 
Just couldn’t let it go 
I wanted to let it go 
Just couldn’t let it go 
I would catch you 
( Just couldn’t let you go) 
I’d catch you as you fall 
( Just couldn’t let it go) 
I would catch you 
( Just couldn’t let you go) 
I’d catch you if i heard your call 
But you tore a hole in space 
Like a dark star, falls from grace 
You burn across the sky 
And I would find you wings to fly 
And I would catch you 
I Would catch your fall 
(Michael e Bono )
I just wanna slide away and come alive again 
I just wanna slide away and come alive again 
I will see that love again, and find a life again 
I just wanna slide away and come alive again
