THE TROUBLES (ALTERNATIVE VERSION)

You think it's easier
To get your fingers out of trouble
When the trouble is you
You think it's easier
To keep your hands out of trouble
When the trouble is you

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me, then hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore

Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say

You think it's easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
You think it's easier
To know your own tricks
Well it's the hardest thing you'll ever do

I have the will for survival
So you can hurt me then hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore

Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say

I stepped outside like I had never seen the night before
Looking at the stars that never looked so bright before
This crooked heart it never felt so light before
A brand new man, I'm a brand new man

Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody stop the world I'm on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
