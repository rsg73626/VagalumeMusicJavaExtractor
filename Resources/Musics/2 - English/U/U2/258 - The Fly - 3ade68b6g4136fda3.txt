THE FLY

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y' know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child

(Bono Vox - Main Voice)
A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all
(The Edge - Secondary)
Love, we shine like a
Burning star
We're falling from
The sky... tonight

It's no secret that a conscience
Can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief

(Bono Vox - Main Voice)
A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
(The Edge - Secondary)
Love, we shine like a
Burning star
We're falling from
The sky... tonight

Love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight

(Bono Vox - Main Voice)
A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all
(The Edge - Secondary)
Love, we shine like a
Burning star
We're falling from
The sky... tonight

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploding 'cos-a one man's lie
Look I gotta go, yeah, I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange
