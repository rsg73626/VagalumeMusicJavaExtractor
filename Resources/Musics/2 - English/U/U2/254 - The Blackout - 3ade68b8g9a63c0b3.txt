THE BLACKOUT

A dinosaur, wonders why it's still off the earth, yeah
A meteor, promises it's not gonna hit, yeah
Earthquake, always happen when you are in bed, bed
The house shakes, maybe was it something I said, Ned

Go, easy on me, easy me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me now

When the lights go out, throw yourself about
The darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

Statues fall, democracy is flat on its back, Jack
We had it all, and what we had is not coming back, Zack
A big mouth says the people
They don't wanna be free for free
The Blackout, is this an extinction event we see

Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me, now

When the lights go out, throw yourself about
The darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

Blackout, it's clear, who you are will appear
Blackout, no fear, so glad that we are all still here

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

When the lights go out, throw yourself about
The darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
