SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY

I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes, make them go away

How long?
How long must we sing this song?
How long
How long?
Tonight we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
And bodies strewn across a dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up
Against the wall!

Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday

And the battles just begun
There's many lost
But tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday

How long?
How long must we sing this song?
How long
How long?
Cause tonight we can be as one
Tonight

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Wipe the tears of your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Wipe your tears away
Wipe bloodshot eyes

Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and Tv is reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On a sunday, bloody sunday

Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
Sunday bloody sunday
