THE CRYSTAL BALLROOM

Life begins with the first glance
The first kiss at the first dance
All of us are wondering why we're here
In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier

Wet the glass till the glasses sing
We punish our hearts till the heart bells ring
Cos where we come from we're not always kind
The human story is what love leaves behind

We're the ghosts of love and we haunt this place
We're the ghosts of love in every face
In the ballroom of the crystal lights
Everyone's here with me tonight
Everyone but you

Our first chance, is their last dance
Our life is shaped by another's hands
Buttoning unbuttoning her Coco dress
Stopping and unstopping every cold caress

Born for bliss, born for this
Every human life begins with a kiss
Kissed by every kind of possibility
And everyone is here tonight with me

We?re the ghosts of love and we haunt this place
We're the ghosts of love in every face
In the ballroom of the crystal lights
Everyone's here with me tonight

Everyone but you
Everyone but you
