NEW YEAR'S DAY (U.S. REMIX)

Yeah...

You won't hold me hold me down
You won't break this sound
I, I will be free again

A stone cold night
On a cold stone floor
A cross of light
On a prison door

I want to be with you, be with you
Night and day
Nothing changes
On New Year's Day

I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again

Though I want to be with you, be with you
Night and day
Nothing changes
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
