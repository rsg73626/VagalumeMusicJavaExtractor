ALL I WANT IS YOU

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want your story to remain untold.
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you.

You say you'll give me a highway with 
no-one on it
a treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night.

You say you'll give me eyes in the 
moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest.
All the promises we make, from the 
cradle to the grave
When all I want is you.

You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night.

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold.
All the promises we break, from the 
cradle to the grave
When all I want is you.
