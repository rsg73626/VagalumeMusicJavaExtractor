ZOOROPA

Zooropa, Vorsprung durch Technik.
Zooropa, be all that you can be.
Be a winner, eat to get slimmer.

Zooropa, a bluer kind of white
Zooropa, it could be yours tonight.
We're mild and green and squeaky clean.

Zooropa, better by design
Zooropa, fly the friendly skies.
Through the appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence.
And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back.

And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we got.

Zooropa, don't worry baby, it'll be alright.
Zooropa, you've got the right shoes
Zooropa, to get you through the night.
Zooropa, it's cold outside, but brightly lit
Zooropa, let's skip the subway,
Zooropa, let's go to the overground.
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby,
Overground.

No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from?

Zooropa, don't worry, baby, it's gonna be alright
Zooropa, uncertainty can be a guiding light.
Zooropa, I hear voices, ridiculous voices
Zooropa, in the slipstream.
Zooropa, let's go, let's go overground.
Zooropa, take your head out of the mud, baby.

She's gonna dream up the world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud, she's gonna dream out loud,
She's gonna dream out loud, dream out loud.
