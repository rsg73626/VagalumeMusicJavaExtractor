EVERLASTING LOVE

Hearts gone astray
Keeping up when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret
I'll come back begging you
Don't you forget
Welcome love we once knew
Yeah

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand was my
Everlasting love

Need you by my side
Come and be my pride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love

From the very start
Open up your heart
Feel the love you've got
Everlasting love

This love will last forever
This love will last forever

Hearts gone astray
Keeping up when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret
I'll come back begging you
Don't you forget
Welcome love we once knew
Yeah...

When love's river flows
No one really knows
'Til someone's there to show the
Way to lasting love

Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
Eternal love

Whatever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong
We'd have our own
Everlasting love

This love will last forever
This love will last forever

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I said was my
Everlasting love

Need you by my side
Come and be my pride
Never be denied
Everlasting love

From the very start
Open up your heart
Feel the love you've got

Everlasting love
