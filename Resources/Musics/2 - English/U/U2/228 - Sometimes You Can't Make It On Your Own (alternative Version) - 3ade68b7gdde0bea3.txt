SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN (ALTERNATIVE VERSION)

Tough, you think you've got the stuff 
You're telling me and anyone 
You're hard enough 

You don't have to put up a fight 
You don't have to always be right 
Let me take some of the punches 
For you tonight 

Listen to me now 
I need to let you know 
You don't have to go it alone 

Sometimes you can't make it on your own 
Sometimes you can't make it on your own 

When I was a young boy, 
In the suburb of seedleborg 
I wanted to be great 
Because good would not be good enough 

Now that I'm older 
I don't see things any clearer 
Nearer now, but still a long way off 

Listen to me now 
I need to let you know 
You don't have to go it alone 

Sometimes you can't make it on your own 
Sometimes you can't make it on your own 

Sing 
You're the reason I sing 
You're the reason why the opera is in me 

Hey now, gotta let you know 
A house still don't make a home 
Don't leave me here alone 

Sometimes you can't make it on your own 
Sometimes you can't make it on your own 
Sometimes you can't make it 
Best you can do is to fake it 
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
