HOLY JOE (GUILTY MIX)

I...
I'm a humble guy
No, really I try
Though it's hard sometimes


True...
I'm hard working too
Working it up to get to see you
Shame, shame
Make shampoo


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe


Please...
Don't make me say please
Champagne and ice cream
It's not what I want, it's what I need


Precocious
Just a little precocious
Expialadocious
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Devotion
And some appreciation
Little heavy rotation
Looks good on me


You know it's not hard
If you think of a lot harder, oh, yeah
Just wanted a moment
To last a little longer, oh, yeah


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe


(Having the best time of anybody's life)
(Closer than ever to everybody's wife)


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be good to me


Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Be good


Here it comes
Here it comes
