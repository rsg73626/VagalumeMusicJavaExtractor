THE THREE SUNRISES

Spirit of the rising sun
Lift me up.
Hold me there and never let me fall.
Love me till I die, my heart can't wait
Soon Thy will be done in this love song.

Love, love song
Love, love song
Hey, hey love won't find
Find its own way home,

In this love song, love
Love, love song.

Sunshine, sunshine on me
Sunshine, sunshine on me.
In this love song, love.
Love, love song.

Hey, hey, love won't find
Find its own way home.

In this love song, love
Love song, love song.
Sunshine, sunshine on me
Bring it through to my heart.
And I will give you everything
I will give you my desire
Sunshine, sunshine on me
Sunshine, sunshine on me.
