NO LINE ON THE HORIZON

I know a girl who's like the sea
I watch her changing every day for me
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

One day she's still, the next she swells
You can hear the universe in her sea shells
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

No, no line on the horizon
no, no line

I know a girl
a hole in her heart
She said, "Infinity is a great place to start"
Oh, oh, oh, oh

"Time is irrelevant, it's not linear"
Then she put her tongue in my ear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line

oh...

The songs in your head are  now on my mind
You put me on pause
I'm trying to rewind, reload and replay

Every night I have the same dream
I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm a traffic cop, Rue de Marais
The sirens are wailing, but it's me that wants to get away
Oh, oh, oh, oh

No line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
