ENERGY DRINK

Are you ready

(Like a Duracell I be energized) --> Grandmaster Caz
(Go berzerk)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Now have you ever been out at the party spot
And you start feeling tired at 11 o'clock?
If stayin up's what you'd like to do
Then this song might be right for you
It's a product designed to keep you in command
And a brand you won't find in an aluminum can
It gets the jam jumpin like a pogo stick
To turn a wallflower to a go-go chick
And it comes with a special guarantee
That if you don't like this song the next one's free
So next time that you start to sink
Tell the DJ play the Energy Drink

(Energy)

(Like a Duracell I be energized)
(Go berzerk)

(Bouncing bounding beverage)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Mainting the rock, don't stop the rock
If you're tired you be wired when I pop the top
Now comin up with no further ado
Diz is gonna get it energized for you
If you need some energy
You can come see him or me
Ugly Duckling pours the cup
Here's your chance to drink it up
When you need a refill you can't be still
There's no - sleep - till..
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 AM
Stop - watch a new day begin

(Energy)

[ VERSE 3 ]
(Einstein)
Drop the break, rock the plate
How long are we stayin up? Awfully late
To a white or a black kid
If you're crawling like an arachnid
This'll get you hyperactive
If you need a second wind or some more adrenaline
I would like to recommend
that you let the record spin
Till the last dance stops the show
So one more time let the energy go

Do what, do what
Do what, do what
Do what, do what
Do what, do what
Do what, do what
Do what, do what
