GOODNIGHT NOW

Quiet
Sh...
Relax

[ VERSE 1: Andy C ]
I'm headin home for some well-earned rest
I watch the moon rise in the sun-lit west
I've had a very long afternoon
But soon I'll escape inside my room
Electric blankets help me hide
From the cold wind and the rain outside
A grandfather clock sounds off its chimes
I reach to the window and shut the blinds
The room darkens to a shade of gray
And I feel my brainwaves fade away
So quiet please, don't talk
I'm about to doze off
Bed so soft I didn't even take my clothes off
Remember all those lovely little lullabys
That your mother used to sing to you, so you close your eyes?
Well, I hope this helps you fall asleep right now
Turn the light down, then relax, goodnight now

Goodnight now

[ CHORUS ]
Much to do, a lot to say
It seems that you've had quite a day
But now it's late, time for bed
Settle down and rest your head

[ VERSE 2: Dizzy Dustin ]
I drink a little milk from a nice warm glass
Put on my PJ's, ready to crash
Took a shower so I'm nice and clean
Mr. Sandman, please bring me a dream
The evening's come, the work is done
My eyes get heavy, my legs are numb
Layin in the sheets feeling lighter than air
So long to go but I'm already there
I'm dog-tired but I'll sleep until I'm restless
And when I'm awake I can make a late breakfast
I see you in the morning, my friend
And until then
Goodnight now

Goodnight now

[ CHORUS ]

Goodnight sweetie
Mommy loves you
