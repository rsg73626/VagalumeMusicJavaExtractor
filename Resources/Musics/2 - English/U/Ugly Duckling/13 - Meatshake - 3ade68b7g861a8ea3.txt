Well hi, welcome to MeatShake where you can 'taste the secret'
And when I tell you what it is, you won't believe it
There's something special in our food you'll taste when you start eating it
Everything we serve has meat in it

But don't you serve french fries and a vegetable plate?
It all has meat (What?)
What about the green salad and the cookies you bake?
Everything has meat (Oh...)
It's nice and tender
Mixed in a blender
Don't you want some meat? (Yeah)
So hot and steamy
Yet smooth and creamy
Come and get your meat (Hey)

Now when your body's hungerin, drive on down and stumble in
Come on, give us half a chance, I promise that you'll come again
If you're not carniverous consider us a challenge
You're too lean and need some proteine, we got it by the gallons
Rest assured our healthy indiscriminating guests prefer
The sweet and meaty morsels we concoct behind my register
Giving good service plus a smile in a paper hat
Our competition's food is crap, who would wanna pay for that?
Please try a beef pie
