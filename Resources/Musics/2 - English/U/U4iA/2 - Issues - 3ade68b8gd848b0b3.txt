ISSUES

I got issues, you got 'em too

I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
I could leave you just this fast

You don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
You don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to suffer

I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

You don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
You don't judge me
'Cause you see it from same point of view

'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to suffer

Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

I got issues, you got 'em too
(And one of them is how bad I need you)
I got issues, you got 'em too

I got issues, you got 'em too
