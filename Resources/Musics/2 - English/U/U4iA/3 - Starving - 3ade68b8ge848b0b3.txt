STARVING

You know just what to say
Things that scare me
I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet
The more that I know you
The more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
(I was so much younger yesterday)

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies
When you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way
Right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I didn't know, I didn't know that I was starving
I didn't know, I didn't know starving till I tasted you

You know just how to make
My heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake
Bring on disaster
You hit me head-on and got me weak in my knees
And something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
So much younger yesterday

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies
When you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way
Right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
(Tasted you)
Till I tasted, till I tasted
So much younger yesterday
Till I tasted, till I tasted
I was so much younger yesterday
Till I tasted, till I tasted
Yeah

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
