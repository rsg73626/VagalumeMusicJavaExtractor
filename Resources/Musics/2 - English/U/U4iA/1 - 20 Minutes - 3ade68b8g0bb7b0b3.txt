20 MINUTES

Humid summer air, pedal to the floor
Wind is in her hair, skinny jeans are torn
Followin' the road, fire in our bones
Lookin' at her phone right before she says to me

It's 20 minutes 'till midnight
Racin' all of the street lights
Tell me what do we got to lose?
Singin' over the airwaves
In my '98 Hyundai
Nothing keepin' me up but you

Up but you

In my flannel shirt from the night before
Woke up next to her lying on the floor
I don't even know how we made it home
Lookin' through my phone, remember what she said to me

It's 20 minutes 'till midnight
Racin' all of the street lights
Tell me what do we got to lose?
Singin' over the airwaves
In my '98 Hyundai
Nothing keepin' me up but you

Up but you

Singin' over the airwaves
In my '98 Hyundai
Nothing keepin' me up but you

Up but you

Humid summer air, pedal to the floor
Wind is in her hair, skinny jeans are torn
