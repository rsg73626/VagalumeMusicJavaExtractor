BACK AGAINST THE WALL

Check me out, I’m standing here
How do you feel now, my dear
Your were wrong and I was right
(I got) your eyes on me tonight

A million times you had me going up and down, back and forth
You won’t get away with it no more

Ooh, you had my back against the wall
But I’m still standing tall
I got my ticket to heaven can’t you see it baby
Now, you’re calling out my name
I still remember the day
You said I was no good for nothing
Nothing got up and saved me

Remember how you put me down
Got me running ‘round and round
Always crawling at your feet
Just to soothe your every need

You turned me inside out and then you had your way with my soul
You won’t play your games with me no more

Ooh, you had my back against the wall
But I’m still standing tall
I got my ticket to heaven can’t you see it baby
Now, you’re calling out my name
I still remember the day
You said I was no good for nothing

Baby, look who’s laughing now
Jokerman’s just left this town
You had your chance
