DEAR NOSTALGIA

Dear Nostalgia

Hey it's been a long time
We've been apart it's true
The road I had to follow
Has led me back to you

I'm staring deep into your eyes
You just can't turn and look away
What you see has made you blind

Dear nostalgia is over
You got to make amends
Both your wings are burning
And no one's gonna follow you my friend

Hey I know I've been there
A thousand times before
The minute I was able
I walked out through that door

I wonder how you've stayed alive
You just can't turn and run away
From the debt you keep inside

Dear nostalgia is over
You got to make amends
Both your wings are burning
And no one's gonna follow you my friend

My friend, all things are gonna change
Tell me why my friend, you just wanna be the same
You keep waiting for my sins
To be punished into sores
And you scream inside, and you bleed inside
No one listens anymore
No one listens anymore
