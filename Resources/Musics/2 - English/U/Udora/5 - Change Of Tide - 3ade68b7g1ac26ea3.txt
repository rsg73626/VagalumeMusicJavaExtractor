CHANGE OF TIDE

Change of Tide

I look outside the memory
And wait for life to start
I tell myself in secret
Now you know just who you are

Been waiting in the shadows
With many wars to fight
All this will be different
And the world I know will make some sense tonight

I don't need you to save my soul
I found the place I'm supposed to go
Running free like the change of tide
I'm so alive, so alive, alive

I walk into the open
The streets are breakin wide
I thought I'd never reach out
But I never really tried

Maybe I'm only dreaming
None of this is true-to-life
I'll just keep on sleeping
Smile at everyone and dive into the light

I don't need you to save my soul
I found the place I'm supposed to go
Running free like the change of tide
I'm so alive, so alive, alive
