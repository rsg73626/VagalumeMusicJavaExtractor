BREATHING LIFE

Here's my body
I'm giving in to you
All these time
have made me see through

I'm stumbling upon the start of something precious
And no one else could ever ever make me turn and say

I'm breathing life
Here today
No more walking 'round in circles
Hold me tight
It's okay
I'll carry this world on my shoulders if you stay

See these thoughts
I'm sharing them with you
As you embrace me with your point of view 

I'm painting every picture filled with expectations
'cause no one else had ever ever made me feel this way

I'm breathing life
Here today
No more walking 'round in circles
Hold me tight
It's okay
I'll carry this world on my shoulders if you stay 

I know that there are never many answers to my questions
But somehow now, I feel like I could open this heart once again

I'm breathing life
Here today
No more walking 'round in circles
Hold me tight
It's okay
I'll carry this world on my shoulders if you stay
