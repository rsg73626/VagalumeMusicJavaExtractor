THE SLEEPING GIANT

The Sleeping Giant

Don't mind apologizing...
Raise your head, take my hand and say
I'll drown mine
No place for preconceptions
It's your turn now so please just say
I'll drown mine

I can't find a way alone
But I won't die away, my son

I see you as one of mine
Took you in when everyone else
Told you lies
Just take your hands off your ears
Tell me would you rather be close
Or always right?

I can't find a way alone
But I won't die away, my son

You just have to let me in
I have killed my fears so now say
I'll drown mine
You are the sleeping giant
Drop the blade, change your destiny
I've drawn mine

I can't find a way alone
I won't die, you are my son
