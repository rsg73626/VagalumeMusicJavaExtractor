THE SONG YOU'LL NEVER HEAR

The Song You'll Never Hear

On a sunny day she wants to fly alone
All these years have come to an end
As unexpected as a fractured bone
She said this one just won't mend

A thousand days to awake and greet the morning
I thought it would kill me, but it made me strong

I'm done, with nothing else to fear
This is the song you'll never hear
I'm holding on to something dear
This is the song you'll never hear

Is there anyone that I could blame this on
This is the end, and it's fair
Is there a way to make it easier
Maybe so, I don't care

As they opened their mouths to a faded story
I thought it would kill me, but it made me strong

I'm done, with nothing else to fear
This is the song you'll never hear
I'm holding on to something dear
This is the song you'll never hear
