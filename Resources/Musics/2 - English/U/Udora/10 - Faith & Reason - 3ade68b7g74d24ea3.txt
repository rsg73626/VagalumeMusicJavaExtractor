FAITH & REASON

Yesterday I ran because I wanted
To swallow up the whole world from a cup
I freed myself from an unforgiving fortress
Riding wheels that never gathered dust

But this time I'm shaking
I'm straying, I'm slowing down
This heart is changing faster
than this will can keep up
I'm trying to like it
I'm trying to fight this war
It's hard to see tomorrow
When faith and reason
Don't rhyme anymore

These days I miss all the ones I avoided
I realized that I was one of them
I'll free myself from every current fortess
And I'm not gonna go back home again

And this time I'm shaking
I'm straying, I'm slowing down
This heart is changing faster
than this will can keep up
I'm trying to like it
I'm trying to fight this war
It's hard to see tomorrow
When faith and reason
Don't rhyme anymore

Yesterday was simple 'cause I wanted
To swallow up the whole world from a cup

But this time I'm shaking
I'm straying, I'm slowing down
This heart is changing faster
than this will can keep up
I'm trying to like it
I'm trying to fight this war
It's hard to see tomorrow
When faith and reason
Don't rhyme anymore
