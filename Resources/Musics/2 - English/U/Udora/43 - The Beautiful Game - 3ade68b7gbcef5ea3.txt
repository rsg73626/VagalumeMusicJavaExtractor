THE BEAUTIFUL GAME

I can do anything 
I can be crowned a king
It’s my time now
To play the beautiful game

Something inside of me
Won’t take them long to see
I’ve kept my vows
Things will never be the same

Closer now, in the sun I wanna stay
’Til those memories are burning
And broken times couldn’t mean more than today
I’m giving everything I’ve got now
To make them remember my name
I’m giving everything I’ve got now
To play the beautiful game

Up on my feet again
Kissing away the pain
It’s my time now
To taste this beautiful game

A new state of urgency
Floods me internally
To show them how 
Things will never be the same

Shining down, there’s a light in front of me
Help me find what I’ve been wanting
Not so far from the world I wanna see
I’m giving everything I got now
To make them remember my name
I’m giving everything I got now
To play the beautiful game
