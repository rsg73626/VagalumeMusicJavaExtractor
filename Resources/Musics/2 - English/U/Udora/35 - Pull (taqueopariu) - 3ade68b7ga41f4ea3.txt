PULL (TAQUEOPARIU)

Pull (taqueopariu)

Did you know that I'm your denial
The voice inside your head
And all the things you took as the only truth
Now are lies instead

I can kill the sun and crack a smile
Would you even touch me
If you only had to crown me

Pull the trigger
Drop the load of fear
Pretend that I am dead
Get inside and be the demon in my head

Can't you see that I'm your reflection
I am what you will be
You'll see thru my eyes, devil in disguise
Soon you'll come to me

I could rape the moon and give you a dime
You could even bleed me
If you only had to crown me

Pull the trigger
Drop the load of fear
Pretend that I'm dead
Get inside and be the demon in my head
