WHEN IT ENDS

When it ends 

Can’t fight alone 
I can’t face it on my own 
And with the first rays of the rising sun 
I won’t talk so loud 
I won’t make a sound 
I’ll sever all the ties with my worst fears 

Now’s when it all ends 
She’s here to take me 
Gather my wings 
I will become free 

Where I should go 
Somewhere like I've never known 
And when the moon will bring the evening glow 
I won’t talk so loud 
I won’t make a sound 
And listen to the voice inside my ears 

Now’s when it all ends 
She’s here to take me 
Gather my wings 
I will become me 
Wait's finally over 
Wait's finally over 
Now's when it all ends 
I will become free
