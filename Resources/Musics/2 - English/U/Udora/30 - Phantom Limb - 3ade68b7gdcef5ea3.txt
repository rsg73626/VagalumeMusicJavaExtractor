PHANTOM LIMB

Hey now, I’m turning away
Far and alone
It’s pulling me deep inside
Hey now, I’m facing the day
Far and alone
Tucked in the hands of time

Know that my thoughts still claim for you
know that I long

Burning inside of me
No matter where I’ll be
I feel like it’s still somewhere within
Just like a phantom limb

Hey now, I’m running away
Far and alone
Stumbling upon my mind
Hey now, I’m placing the weight
Far and alone
No one could break this stride

Know that my heart still begs for you
Know that I long

Burning inside of me
No matter where I’ll be
I feel like it’s still somewhere within
Just like a phantom limb
Just like a phantom limb
Just like a phantom limb

Know that my thoughts still claim for you
Know that I won’t be long
Know that my heart still waits for you
Know that I long

Burning inside of me
No matter where I’ll be
I feel like it’s still somewhere within
Just like a phantom limb

Burning inside of me
No matter where I’ll be
I feel like you’re still somewhere within
Just like a phantom limb
