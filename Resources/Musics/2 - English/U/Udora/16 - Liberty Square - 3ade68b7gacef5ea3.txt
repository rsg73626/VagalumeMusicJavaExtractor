LIBERTY SQUARE

I see you for the first time as the golden age was poured
All the love is still immune to changes like before
Walking down the pathway I was lifted off the floor
I close my eyes and know it’s much too strong to be ignored

All these words I hope to say
Won’t you take me in today

Liberty square downtown
Far away you’re still in me
Liberty square right now
I dream of starting over when I’m here

As seasons passed I burned inside and longed for something more
I tried to find it carelessly by drifting from the shore
But every moment told me I could knock back at your door
Open arms all reaching til I'm back into the core

By your side is where I’ll lay
Hold me in and make me stay

Liberty square downtown
Far away you’re still in me
Liberty square right now
I dream of starting over when I’m here
