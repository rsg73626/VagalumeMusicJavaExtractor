NOWHERE, EW

Nowhere, EW

I could burn the flag 'cause I'm from nowhere
Spit on the swastika - tattooed forehead
I could turn the crosses upside down
Your savior is not enough, not enough for me

I could urinate on a chest filled with stars
Laugh when the game ends before its start
So player of the day, a new record's set
No merit is in the back of a net

Home is all around, away from none
It's beyond borders
When the same old voices keep swaying
With a subtle change of tone, I wonder

Is it me or is the whole world wrong?
When I think about how important
A golden tiolet seat can be
The water splashes once again
And as soon as I breathe in
It gets hard to tell any difference from what I smell...

I'm so tired of breathing lies
About the rules I should know and ways I should sing
There ain't just place I belong to
The further I go, the closer I get

The more it feels like home
I could burn the flag 'cause I'm from nowhere
Came all the way from everywhere
I wanna turn the structures upside down

One flush is not enough, not enough
When the same old voices keep swaying choices
Is it me or is the whole world wrong?
