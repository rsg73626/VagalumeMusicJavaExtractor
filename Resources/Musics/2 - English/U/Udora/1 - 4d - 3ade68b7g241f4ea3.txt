I think you will feel no pain
When heads fall, eyes close, blood drips
Soulless automata cure me, cure me
'Cause I am no longer what I used to be

I'm dead
Dying
Diseased
Disabled

I need to justify this
For measure of value's sake
Suits me if propaganda is force-fed, force-fed
'Cause eyes sewn shut don't pose a threat, they won't see

I'm dead
Dying
Diseased
Disabled

You will die so I can live here
Peel your body, hiding my fears
Rest my thinking brain on your skin
In God we trust, never shed a tear
I've never felt a thing
