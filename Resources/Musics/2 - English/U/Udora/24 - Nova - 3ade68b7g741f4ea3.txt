NOVA

Nova 

Nova how can you defy 
One thousand thoughts of maybe 
You shine through all our souls 
Umbilical cord embrace 
Break it find it just take me away 
Nobody gets it at all 

Under a moving rooftop 
Sheltered in blue rusted walls 
'til the daylight 
Dressed in costumes of stool 
Spilling tides of naked beauty 
and the stench of purity 

High spinning head counter clockwise 
Unwavering linkage, it's soul delight 
Blow us away we'll land back on our feet 

Nova how can you untie 
one thousand knots of hatred 
You shine through all our pores 
no one ever gets the trace 
break it find it just take me away 

In time just a flick of the wrist 
is the satellite for an escape 
Drawing near echoes around us 
Screaming, let's live through decay 

Nova how can you defy 
One thousand thoughts of maybe 
Come shine through all our holes 
Fast forward into grace
