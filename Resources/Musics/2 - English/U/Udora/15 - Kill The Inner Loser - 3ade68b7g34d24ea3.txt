KILL THE INNER LOSER

Never looking back is how I faced it
The will was stronger
And I just wanted to taste it
I didn't wanna be left behind or treated unkind

Gave in to the dance so easily
Ty pushing 'till doubts about to leave
Screaming in the head everyday
It's here and it's here to stay

How long does it take
For you to deceive me again
You're gonna prove it
Then make me believe
Kill the inner loser
Is it over I can't tell
I crave for amusement
Don't take me out
Ain't time to crack this shell

I hope you tell me I'm beautiful
You tell me I'm good, yes I hope
I know my frustrations are gone
If I can pay for what you sell again
Sell myself again

How long does it take
For you to deceive me again
You gotta prove it
So make me believe 
Kill the inner loser
Is it over I can't tell
I crave for amusement
Don't take me out
Ain't time to crack this shell

Never looking back is how I faced it
Your will is stronger
And I just wanna taste it
I still don't wanna be left
Behind or treated unkind
