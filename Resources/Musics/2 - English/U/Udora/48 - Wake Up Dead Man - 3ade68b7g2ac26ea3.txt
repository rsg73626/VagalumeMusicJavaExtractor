WAKE UP DEAD MAN

Wake Up Dead Man

I dare you to wake and rise above inertia
When everything you see is standing still
Learn how to live and set yourself in motion
A change of story rests upon your will

I count the minutes for you to understand this

Wake up dead man
Stillness can be undone
Go find your answers
You’ll be living as one

I dare you to breathe and start a revolution
Against the things that ever caused you pain
Cry all the tears that fit this indignation
And don’t let yourself get hurt again

I count the minutes for you to understand this

Wake up dead man
Stillness can be undone
Go find your answers
You’ll be living as one
