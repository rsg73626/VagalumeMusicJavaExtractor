SEE YOU LATER

See You Later

Little pins on airplane windows
Help me with the fear as it flows
Countless hours, wasted patience
Struck by ancient reservations

See you later, don’t you cry
I’m done waiting
Gonna leave this place behind
See you later, don’t you cry
I’m done waiting
There’s some things I’ve got to find

Unmade choices blur my vision
Seats against my disposition
Crying baby, indecision
Slowly fading, healed incision

See you later, don’t you cry
I’m done waiting
Gonna leave this place behind
See you later, don’t you cry
I’m done waiting
There’s some things I’ve got to find

Captain finally turned the lights on
Someone smiling asks a question
As I’m searching for the reason
Seatbelt’s open, world’s not prison
