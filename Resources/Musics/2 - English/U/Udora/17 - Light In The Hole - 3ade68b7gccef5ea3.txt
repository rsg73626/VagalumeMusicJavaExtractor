LIGHT IN THE HOLE

Shaken by the rapture
All I know is out of place
Gave in to the lure to kiss her face
Ruthless in reaction
Stern embrace I learned to crave
She's the master I've become a slave

But I'm here,
Can you hear, hear me
Another year
I'm somewhere near

Said I'd be gone tomorrow
'Cause it feels like she's in control
Trying so hard to swallow
I believe, I believe I can see
a light in the hole

Gaze upon the wonder
All in me is made of clay
Promises are made and thrown away
Easy prey to conquer
Someone help me run away
She will pull me in and make me stay

And I'm here
Not a fear, fear 
Another year
And I'm still here

Said I'd be gone tomorrow
'Cause it feels like she's in control
Trying so hard to swallow 
I believe, I believe I can see
a light in the hole

But I'm here
Can you hear, hear me
Another year
I'm somewhere
I'm still here
