PLASTIC SMILE

Plastic Smile

Smiling, and the world's come to see my eyes
I'm trying, I could wave without a hand this time
All the way up, I'm crashing into fame
Taken by surprise, a backseat ride, it's sustenance

I'll believe I'm Sharon Stone
Bright spotlight is where I belong
From the ease stage I see someone
Stepping in my shadow
More make-up
I'm blushing on the inside
I've got now my own line of
Non-toxic plastic limbs

Smiling, and the world's come to hear my side
I'm trying, I can dance without my legs with pride
Smiling, 'cause the world comes at 8 tonight
I'm trying, I could just put on a plastic smile
Severed a member and burned myself
There's a framed horizon falling for it

All the way up, I'm crashing into fame
You'll be taken by surprise, a backseat ride on a car wreck

Smiling, and the world's come to see my eyes
I'm trying, I could dance with my prosthetic thighs
Smiling, 'cause the world comes in at 8 tonight
Smiling, I could wave without a hand this time
