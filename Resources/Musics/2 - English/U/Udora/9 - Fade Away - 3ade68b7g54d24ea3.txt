FADE AWAY

Distance kills my pride
It makes me numb inside
Blood won't run throughout my veins
My love slowly dies
As I forget these ties
And what was pure is filled with stains

I'm running 'round the world alone
I'm losing ground away from home

Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Just say it's all right, all right, all right
Tell me there's still some time
Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Just say it's all right, all right, all right
And I'll be feeling fine

I feel my eyes run dry
from learning not to cry
Nothing seems to go as planned
I'm curving down my spine
Because this sun won't shine
I see no light from where I stand

I'm running 'round the world alone
I'm losing ground away from home

Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Just say it's all right, all right, all right
Tell me there's still some time
Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Just say it's all right, all right, all right
And I'll be feeling...

Come back and save me
Come back and save me

Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Say it's all right, all right, all right
And I'll be feeling fine

I'm running 'round the world alone
I'm losing ground away from home
I'm crumbling as something I don't wanna be
I begging you please, bring the life back in me

Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Just say it's all right, all right, all right
Tell me there's still some time
Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Just say it's all right, all right, all right
And I'll be feeling...

Come back and save me
Come back and save me
Fade away
Don't let me fade away
Say it's all right, all right, all right
And I'll be feeling fine
