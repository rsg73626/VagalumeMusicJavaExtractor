PIECES

I'm sinking into solitude 
Awakened by the call 
I hear the words I feared the most 
They crushed my heart against a wall 

I look around 
Everything seems to be falling apart 
I loosen my grip on those years 
And let me come down, my way 

All pieces remain intact 
It's coming, coming 
I know I know I know 
It’s gonna take some time 

A part of me is screaming 
But I'm born again somehow 
I'm slippery from motherly fluids 
Still I'm breathing doubt 

I stack up piles of minutes 
Against memories from afar 
I loosen my grip on these fears 
And let them come down, my way 

All pieces remain intact 
It’s coming, coming 
I know I know I know 
When that day comes 
There will be no regrets 

So I'm waiting 
And it's aching 
Like the words inside your head 
I'm waiting...
