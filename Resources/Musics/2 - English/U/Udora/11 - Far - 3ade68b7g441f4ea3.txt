FAR

Far

Cut my heart
Drowned my fears
Torn that page
I just know I'm gone

Blind to the touch of your eyes
I meant to save the reason
When I had to say goodbye
'Cause I followed the leading role of the deceived
I hoped it all could still live when it should die

Holding my spite
For a half-empty bed 
I'm lying on again
There is no room for suffering
It's ended and I'm wishing you so well

I've cut my heart
Drowned my fears
Torn that page
I just know I'm gone

Maybe we could have stayed closer
Instead of going so far
'Cause I followed the leading role of the deceived
We hoped it all could still live when it should die, should die

All my fears replaced
Way down, on my own
Take this broken pledge
And leave me here, 'till it's all in vain
And all my fears are replaced
Way down, all by one
Take this broken pledge
And leave me here, 'till it's all in vain
And all my fears replaced
