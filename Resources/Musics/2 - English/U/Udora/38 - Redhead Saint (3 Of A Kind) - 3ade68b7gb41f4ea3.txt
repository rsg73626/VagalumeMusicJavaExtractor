REDHEAD SAINT (3 OF A KIND)

Redhead Saint (3 of a kind)

Every time I try to say it
Some airbag stops me from colliding
With the memory of this pain
But today I arrived on time
To break out and toss my hate
Let me tell you right now this is real
Hey is it too late now? I'm dying
Hope it ain't too late now, I'm dying
I can't pretend I'm here to say goodbye


Never seen a redhead saint
But this time I can make it right
As 23 years of sweeping away
Pass right before my eyes
So blind I could hardly see
We were meant to live like
We're 3 of a kind
Hey is it too late now? I'm dying
Hope it ain't too late now, I'm dying
Don't wanna carry the weight
Need to see your faces, tie your shoelaces
So both of you please, make me get in touch
With who I am, I am

Time to break out and toss my hate
As I approach the door
Closer, the 2 of you
Ask me how have I been...
This time I know I should say it
But I'll just pretend I'm here to say goodbye
