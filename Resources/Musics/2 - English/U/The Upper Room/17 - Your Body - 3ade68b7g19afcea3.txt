YOUR BODY

In a recipe for a disaster 
In a tragedy forever after 
I hate to say, I hate to say, I hate to say 
That the people in my life have gone tomorrow 
Here today, they're here to... 

I have lost the only one who mattered to me 
Creep around your house because you hate your family 
But I have lost the only one who mattered to me 
Lights are very low because you hate your body 

In a club at night into the dark 
In another time into the heart 
The more we drink, the more we drink, the more we drink 
Then our problems aren't as bad as what we think 
As what we think, as what we... 

I have lost the only one who mattered to me 
Creep around your house because you hate your family 
But I have lost the only one who mattered to me 
Lights are very low because you hate your body 
(repeat)
