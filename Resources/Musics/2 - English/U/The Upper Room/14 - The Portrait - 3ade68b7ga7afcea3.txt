THE PORTRAIT

We hate everyone we meet 
Cause they think that they are sweet 
Live together in a house 
Life is easy in this town 

And from the day that you were born 
You made it clear that you are torn 
Between joy and misery 
Happy times, agony 
Or is that just me? 

This is a portrait of a life 
This is a photo on the wall 
This is the sharp edge of a knife 
Ending it all 
Ending it all 

We hear laughter all around 
Cover ears, escape the sounds 
But feel guilty later on 
Cause we know that we are wrong 

And from the day that you were born 
You made it clear that you are torn 
Between joy and misery 
Happy times, agony 
Or is that just me? 

This is a portrait of a life 
This is a photo on the wall 
This is the sharp edge of a knife 
Ending it all 
Ending it all 

Oooh... 

This is a portrait of a life 
This is a photo on the wall 
This is the sharp edge of a knife 
Ending it all 
Ending it all
