IN LOVE WE TRUST

You are a leader 
You must be a spiritual healer 
Oh no probably not 

You are a teacher 
You must be a wonderful creature 
Oh no probably not 

But all that i wanted 
From you was alot 

It's an airport early morning 
You need somebody else 
In love we trust 

You are an artist 
You must know the secrets behind this all 
Oh no probably not 

But all that i wanted 
From you was alot 

It's an airport early morning 
You need somebody else 
In love we trust 
And it came without a warning 
It's messing with my health 
In love we trust 

But we probably shouldn't 
No we probably shouldn't 
We possibly shouldn't 
No we probably shouldn't 
Probably shouldn't
