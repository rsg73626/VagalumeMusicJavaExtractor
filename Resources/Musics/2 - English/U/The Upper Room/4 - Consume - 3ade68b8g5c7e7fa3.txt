CONSUME

I can hear Your still small voice, 
In the quiet of my heart
I can feel Your hand on me, 
When I cannot take a step
So I lay down my pride, 
And I pray this prayer to You

Consume all of  me, Lord take my life I  pray
Consume all of me, mold me day by day
Consume me, so that I can say
All that I have and all that I am
Is in You, In You

Spirit of my Living God, 
Come and fill my life
So many times I run this race 
Competing for Your prize
So I lay down my pride, 
And I pray  this prayer to You

You have made me Lord I know, 
To worship at your feet

So when Iove nothing left of me, 
I find myself with You
So I give You all I am, 
And I live this life for You

Take all of me 
Consume me
