NEVER COME BACK

Remember slagging all your best friends off 
it always made me happy, yeah 
because i do prefer you when you're cross 
i need your tears true 
i need your sighs too 
i do despise you 

then there was a terrible crime 
near to our house 
we talked all the time 
panicked about if they'd ever come back 
ever come back 
ever come back 

remember calling you some nasty words 
i said that you were evil, yeah 
all the terrible things you heard 
i need your tears true 
i need your sighs too 
i do despise you 

then there was a terrible crime 
near to our house 
we talked all the time 
panicked about if they'd ever come back 
ever come back 
ever come back 

i need your tears true 
i need your sighs too 
i do despise you 

whenever there's a terrible crime 
near to our house 
we talk all the time 
panick about if they'll ever come back 
ever come back 
ever come back 
(never come, never come)
