KILL KILL KILL

You say that I'm over the top 
You say that I couldn't feel... 
That wa-a-a-ay 
From the back of your automobile 
I say that I know it's real 
So never ever stray 

You were happy but that changed from day to day 
Whenever you were under, whenever it was over 
Think it's over then 
You're living on a fancy street 
But you're not complete 
You are not complete 

They can't kill kill kill you anymore 
They can't kill kill kill you anymore 
They can't kill kill kill you anymore 

It's a wound that will never heal 
Weighed down cause you couldn't feel... 
That wa-a-a-ay 
You fell in love but that's okay 
You had a friend but that's okay 
So never ever say 

That you're happy and it's better every day 
Whenever you were under, whenever it was over 
Think it's over then 
You're living on a fancy street 
But you're not complete 
You are not complete 

They can't kill kill kill you anymore 
They can't kill kill kill you anymore 
They can't kill kill kill you anymore 

When we're on the concrete 
Standing on the same street 
I won't let our eyes meet 

And it's true that I told them how 
It's here and I'm feeling now... 
That wa-a-a-ay 
She swims a lot but thats okay 
We don't talk a lot... 
That wa-a-a-ay
