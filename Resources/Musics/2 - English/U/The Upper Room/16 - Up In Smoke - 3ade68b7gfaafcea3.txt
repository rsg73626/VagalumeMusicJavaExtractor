UP IN SMOKE

Just the other night talking on the news 
Mixing chemicals in an old test tube 
And in her interview she said 
I will find the cure but it's time for bed 

And you do it, I do it, we do it 
You want them, yeah we want them only for ourselves, aah 

But when her test tube broke 
It all went up in smoke 

Mixing chemicals and chemicals 
Mixing chemicals 
Oh 

Take me to a place where the coats are white 
In the surgery will be up all night 
And in the doctor's waiting room 
I will take your hand and we'll sing this tune 

And you do it, I do it, we do it 
You want them, yeah we want them only for ourselves, aah 

But when her test tube broke 
It all went up in smoke 

Mixing chemicals and chemicals 
Mixing chemicals 
Oh 

But when her test tube broke 
It all went up in smoke 
If you could ask you would 
But it would do no good 

Mixing chemicals and chemicals 
Mixing chemicals and chemicals 
Mixing chemicals and chemicals 
Mixing chemicals 
Oh, oh
