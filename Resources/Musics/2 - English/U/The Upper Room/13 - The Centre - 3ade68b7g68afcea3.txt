THE CENTRE

On the last day 
Of the year, year 
In the garden, very clear 
But what I fear 
Is that I'm losing 
What I held dear 
But my goal 
Is nothing at all 

They said it's (they said it's) 
Pathetic (pathetic) 
But I won't (but I won't) 
Forget it 

She was the centre 
You're taking me 
Towards the centre 
Of my old life 

Take an issue 
Or a truth, truth 
Go and shout it from the roof 
Yeah from the roof 
People call it 
Self-abuse 
But my goal 
Is nothing at all 

They said it's (they said it's) 
Pathetic (pathetic) 
But I won't (but I won't) 
Forget it 

She was the centre 
You're taking me 
Towards the centre 
Of my old life 

(guitar solo) 

Don't talk about it 
(Don't talk about it) 

They said it's (they said it's) 
Pathetic (pathetic) 
But I won't (but I won't) 
Forget it 

She was the centre 
You're taking me 
Towards the centre 
Of my old life 
She was the centre 
You're taking me 
Towards the centre 
Of my old life
