ONCE FOR ME

Be like me, quit your job 
Money don't mean anything much 
I took a means of transport 
Down to your old school 
All the way thinking how 

That you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 
That you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 

Around the world they have been told 
She let me down lightly in love 
She took a means of transport 
Down to my old school 
All the way screaming how 

That you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 
That you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 

Oh, you hate everything I do 
Oh, you say nothing good reminds me of you 

Oooh... 

When you arrive, and when you leave 
Nothing will change here, and so... 
You take a means of transport 
Down to our old school 
Tearing your photos of her 

And you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 
And you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 

Oooh...
