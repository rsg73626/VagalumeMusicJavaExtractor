IT BEGAN ON RADIO

I came across who I want 
When I heard the first in the morning 
Singing song about her love 
It was clear that I would be falling 

It began on radio 
And the feeling seems to grow 
It was only tend to wait 
But I thought it could be fate 

I walk into a record store 
And I see a face that's familiar 
Someone asks me what I need 
And I say I want to be with her 

It began on radio 
And the feeling seems to grow 
Saw my poster on the wall 
But my friend was bound to call 

And all I know is that she's not here 
All I hope is maybe, maybe next year 
Maybe next year 

Turn the light only in my room 
On the day when nothing is easy 
She turns the light only in my room 
If I wrote to her would she needs me 

It began on radio 
And my feeling seems to grow 
It was only tend to wait 
But I thought it could be fate 

It began on radio 
And the feeling seems to grow 
Saw my poster on the wall 
But my friend was bound to call
