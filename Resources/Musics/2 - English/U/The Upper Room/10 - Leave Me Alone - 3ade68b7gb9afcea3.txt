LEAVE ME ALONE

She really gets me started 
Every time that she is near 
Shame that we're always parted 
Shame that she's never near 

On the day that we went out shopping 
All she bought were very short skirts 
Shame that we're always parted 
Shame that she's always saying 

Please stop calling me at home 
Please stop calling me at home 
Thought I think you're lovely baby 
Won't you please, leave me alone? 

Found a note lying on your table 
Found a note, dropped it on the floor 
And he always will be parted 
Of that I'm completely sure 

Please stop calling me at home 
Please stop calling me at home 
Thought I think you're lovely baby 
Won't you please, leave me alone? 

Please stop calling me at home 
Please stop calling me at home 
Thought I think you're lovely baby 
Won't you please, leave me alone?
