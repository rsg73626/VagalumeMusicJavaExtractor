COMBINATION

One heart beats suffocation 
You're in my eye 
You talk of starving nations 
That are very dry 
And all the years of segregation 
Make you wanna cry 
Heart beat of the starving nation 
Telling me the reasons why 

It was a combination of many things 

Big bang and the constellations 
Make you feel alone 
You march on the corporations 
That invade our homes 
You don't take all the new medication 
So tell me why you have grown 

It was a combination of many things, uhuh 
It's like a combination of many things, uhuh 

You're the kind of girl that could fit 
You're the kind of girl in my world 
You're the kind of girl that could fit 

You ... to a new medication (?) 
Far away from here 
It's too bad your accomodation 
Isn't very near 
Cause you make me think twice 
And you are kind of right 
That we're sitting on top of... 
And we're dancing on top of... 
And we're jumping on top of... 
And we're laughing on top of... 
And we're living on top of the ice 

It was a combination of many things 
It's like a combination of many things 
It was a combination of many things 
Of many things 
Of many things
