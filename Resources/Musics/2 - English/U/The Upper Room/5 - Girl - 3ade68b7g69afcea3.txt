GIRL

Set the scene, we're running from danger 
In a new area we're living with a stranger 
And taking precautions so they'll never know where we've been 

And couple that are going out, we're nowhere to be found 
When I was young girl, you were never really here but now 
With a piano in a freezing deserted house 

A little piece of me was calling 
A little piece of you was falling 

When they come for our mothers and brothers 
And under the floorboards they look for our lovers 
And throwing our clothes out of the window and down the stairs 

But all around the area they will only find ties and hats 
Under the pianos they will only find booby traps 
Under their noses we're moving behind their backs 

A little piece of me was calling 
A little piece of you was falling 

We weren't always this close 
But I loved you the most 
You weren't always my girl 
Girl... girl... girl 

And almost every night 
Almost alright, almost there... 

A little piece of me was calling 
A little piece of you was falling 
You weren't always my girl 
Girl... girl... girl
