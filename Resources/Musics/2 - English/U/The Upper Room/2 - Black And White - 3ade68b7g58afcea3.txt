BLACK AND WHITE

I met her under a shelter 
We were hiding from the rain (ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh) 
She was blowing bubbles 
And I'll never feel the same (ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh) 
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain 
I'll miss you in a minute 
If you'll only feel the same 
Oh... 

Now it's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
It's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
Yeah 

She held an orange bottle 
And she drunk it with a straw (ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh) 
I watched her glide around 
Around the people on the floor (ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh) 
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain 
I'll kiss you in a minute 
If you'll only feel the same 
Oh... 

Now it's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
It's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
Oh... oh... oh... ooooh... 
Yeah 

She threw a dart right through my shirt to my heart 
Then came back later I had all but fallen apart (ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh) 
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain 
Will she ever feel the same 
Oh... 

Now it's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
It's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
Oh... oh... oh... ooooh... ooooh... 

Now it's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now 
It's all black and white for me baby 
It's all black and white for me now
