ALL OVER THIS TOWN

It's a funny feeling, not really 
Comfort me, cos I'm hearing violins 
In the streets, friends I meet say 
It's all over this town 

The way you cheat, the way you lie 
The way you want me to die 
Over this 
Over this 
Over this town 

The way you drive through the night 
With a gun, me in your sights 
Over this 
Over this 
Over this town 

I'm caught in your headlights 
No escape, move too late 
And I'm hearing violins, in my head 
In my bed, 
Cause it's all over this town 
And that does get around 

The way you cheat 
The way you lie 
The way you want me to die 
Over this 
Over this 
Over this town 

The way you drive through the night 
With a gun, me in your sights 
Over this 
Over this 
Over this town 

So many questions, floating around 
But for the moment, hide underground 

The way you cheat 
The way you lie 
The way you want me to die 
Over this 
Over this 
Over this town 

The way you drive through the night 
With a gun, me in your sights 
Over this 
Over this 
Over this town
