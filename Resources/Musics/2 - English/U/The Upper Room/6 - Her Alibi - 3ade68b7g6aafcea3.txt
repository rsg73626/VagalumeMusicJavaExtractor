HER ALIBI

Beds of roses 
It's not anymore 
Some will do, some die 
This is her alibi 

Went to see him 
Breathe free the other night 
Never went inside your door 
Think I was home by four 

You never trust in me 
Like I trust in you 
You check my alibi 
You'll see it's true 

People talking 
They say they heard it all 
Never went inside the door 
Except for on the floor 

While you're sleeping 
And I'm wide awake 
Thinking back, your alibi 
Sounds like it's not a lie 

You never trust in me 
Like I trust in you 
You check my alibi 
You'll see it's true 
You never trust in me 
Like I trust in you 
You check my alibi 
Oh oh 

Check it out 
Check it out 
Check it out 
Check it out 

You never trust in me 
Like I trust in you 
You check my alibi 
You'll see it's true 
You never trust in me 
Like I trust in you 
You check my alibi 
Oh oh
