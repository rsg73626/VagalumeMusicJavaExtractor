POP THE GLOCK

Mc am i, people call me Uff
When i rock the party, bust a nut
Feadz is breaking out the beat
Shit be hotter, than me
Me and he are crusalicious
Better watch out, my clan gets vicious
Bad ass bitch, im rated x
I'm get to hip, and gotta sell sex
Cross the beach onto the street
Gotta work hard, no room to cheat
Crunk and grime, that's my bloodline
Feadz is mixin, uffie's shoutin
Uffie is bangin, feadz is bangin
Time to get low, do the tootsie roll
That's how we do, do it hot
And if you understood, would you?

Stop hatin and playin hard
I got a loaded bodyguard
Don't make a pull, you glock them pop
Uffie's gonna make this shit rock
Like Dough, Dough I like
Boys call me when they feel freaky hot
I run this show, you got to slow
Pick up the pace, with you cracked out face
Uffie's bangin, feadz is bangin
Time to get low, do the tootsie roll
That's how we do, do it hot
And if you understood, would you?
Beat my rhyme, if you can
Yeah you talk shit, think i care?
My style in this flow, is confusin cause ya don't know

(the) Pop the glock (7x)
The glock you pop!

Sound like twista, fast as hell
I rock this beat you know damn well
Gonna make it to the top
Spit this shit, till you drop
Down low is where ya keep it
Boy, don't let anyone know
Gonna tear you down, underneath you just a clown
Time everyone see, what you really be

Play the game, the game get's played
I got a man and he goes by feadz
Play the game, the game get's played
I got a man and he goes by feadz

Uffie is bangin, feadz is bangin
Time to get low, do the tootsie roll
That's how we do, do it hot
And if you understood, would you?
Beat my rhyme, if you can
Yeah ya talk shit, think i care?
My style in this flow, is confusin cause ya don't know

Pop the glock, the glock you pop
If you're outta line it's your bang pop
Pop the glock, the glock you pop
If you're outta line it's your bang pop
Pop the glock, the glock you pop
If you're outta line it's your bang pop

Uffie's bangin, Uffie's bangin, Uffie's bangin, feadz's bangin
Uffie's bangin, feadz's bangin
Time to get low, do the tootsie roll
Uffie's bangin, feadz's bangin, uffie's bangin, feadz's bangin
Me and he are crusalicious
Better watch out my clan gets vicious
Thats how we do, do it hot
And if you understood, would you?
Stop hatin and playin hard
I got a loaded bodyguard
Don't make a pull, you glock them pop
Uffie's gonna make this shit rock
Like Dough, Dough i like
Boys call me when they feel freaky hot
I run this show, you got to slow
Pick up the pace, with you cracked out face
