GIVE IT AWAY

I don't know what else to say 
I give it away 
You keep on making me wait 
But I'm not your slave 

I waste a shit load of time 
And I'm on the rush 
You're playing tricks with my mind 
And you lie so much 

I've got my own responsibility 
I don't need anyone else to take care of but me 
You are out of my life 
Why should I work for you 

Now it's time to handle your own shit as we do 
I gave you more than one chance 
To redeem yourself 

You're still lying to my face 
You don't give a fuck 
For you I've built a good life
