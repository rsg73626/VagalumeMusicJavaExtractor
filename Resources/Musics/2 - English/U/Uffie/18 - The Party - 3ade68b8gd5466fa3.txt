THE PARTY

Let me tell you what I do when my day is over.
After picking the right clothes for about an hour.
Oooh, I'm turning orange from all the carats around my neck.
Tonight, I'm takin' out the bling and I'm dressed to impress.

I'm gettin' ready for my night out on the town.
I'm lookin' hot cause you know we are holdin' it down.
Rockin' high-tops and sayin' no to stilettos.
Cause I might get drunk off my ass and I don't wanna fall.

Out on the streets all the taxis are showin' me love.
Cause I'm shinin' like a princess, in the middle of thugs.
And at the clubs, the bouncers recognize my face.
So while your waiting in the line, we just enter the place.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

I'm callin' all my ladies at the table of 3.
Throwin' back a couple bottles and the tabs on me.
I been waitin' to get crazzzy.

Table dancin, smashin glasses, it's nice to get naughty.
Now we all ready to head out of the VIP.
I'm lookin' good and I can feel that all eyes are on me.
It's time to show how em how we do on the floor.

So while my DJ play the track I want my girls on the floor.

Now you know I made an anthem for all my hot chicks.
And I ain't about how we girls are raisin' your dicks.
I got the surround sound so why ya wanna see me fall?
I'm just tryin' to have a blast and I ain't takin' your call.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

You and me, c'mon let's take it to the next level.
Let's all go to the hotel pool as we finish the bottle.
Maybe kiss and don't tell, it's the rule around here.
You must have put me under a spell I lose control when your near.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)
