NEUNEU

You wanna talk about it?
(Uh!) Let me talk about it
I got the sound that kills and there is nothin like it
I came to rock the party
You got to work your body
We in the dark, no one can see so I can touch your body

You know my name, right?
I'm kinda famous now
I'm takin pictures with my fans and signin tits now
I am a rockstar

And I party like one
In fact I partied like a rockstar before being one
Push on the accelerator
I like when we drive faster

I want to feel the speed
This car got what I need
No we ain't gonna stop
We drivin to the top

I don't want to look back
I'm choosing the fast track
You can practice all you want just to get me
I ain't tried to test no one

I'm just tryin to quiz me
Sometimes what I do is wrong
Sometimes I can reach the
Higher state of livin cause I'm making you feel free

You wanna talk about it?
(Uh!) Let me talk about it
I got the sound that kills and there is nothing like it
I came to rock the party
You got to work your body
We in the dark, no one can see so I can touch your body

Music is the best thing to ever happen to me
I'm hooked on that thing
Now I'm feeling like a junkie
I'll bring your radio dance if you do it with me
The U the F-F-F-F-F-I gets better with the big E

Right now I don't think anyone is gonna bounce outta here
The music got you on the floor
We ain't goin nowhere
I know you like the way I drop it like the barstool
I might be young, but I'm killing like I'm supposed to
Dancing like I'm supposed to
Party like I'm supposed to
Like R. Kelly in the club where I'm supposed to

You know we sound so fresh
No one can do it best
It's just another track
No we ain't gonna stop
Y
