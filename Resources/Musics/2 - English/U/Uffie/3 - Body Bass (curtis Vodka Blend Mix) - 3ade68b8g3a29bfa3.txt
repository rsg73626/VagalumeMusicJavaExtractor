BODY BASS (CURTIS VODKA BLEND MIX)

What?
Spank spank spank spank it, fuck it
Swi-sw-swi-swi-switch it, fuck it
Spank it, fuck it, spank it, fuck it
Switch it up, switch it up
Spank it, fuck it, switch it up

Come on fellas, bust a nut
All the ladies with a slim slim waist
Lemme see you work your booty
There's one real sketchy boy who's out there
Comin' too close, gettin' in my hair

Yeah yeah wow, you can see my underwear
But yo! It's not about you I care
I write my rhymes with shit penmanship
Open my teeth, you won't see any chip
Watch my smile bleedin' on this clip

Fuck with me and you'll feel snip snip
Yeah that's right, I'm a damn crazy brat
But it's okay 'cause my style's so phat
Yo dawg, I got a crazy ass coolcat
She's walkin' around, lookin' like a hood rat

I make my sound and fuck the rest
You can't talk shit cause I roll with the best
Ed Rec crew's gonna make the West
We're unstoppable, so don't get stressed
What's that look, boy, you wanna box?
Or maybe just see how the how the how the pussy pops
Either way I'm gonna knock your socks
You def-definitely know I rock
I'm not a girl that's lackin' courage (?)
But don't be fooled, I do feel fury
In this flow I'm makin' you hurry
And all your eyes are turnin' blurry

Me and my clique, we makin' hits
That's why the girls wanna show us their tits
Roll with the boys, but I got wits
Even though I spit on the rudest shit

I never go out when I'm not tipsy
My bling's jingling just like I'm a gypsy
Sure, I'll drink Jack and Hennessy
But mostly pass on the ecstasy
Spank it, fuck it, switch it up
Come on fellas, bust a nut
All the ladies with a slim slim waist

Lemme see you work your booty bass
Spank it, fuck it, switch it up
Come on fellas, bust a nut
All the ladies with a slim slim waist
Lemme see you work your booty bass
Golden, get out, your style's goodbye, and gifted

I make everything shine, 2, 3
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 admit
Tha-tha-that that girl's lookin' fine
You're way too close, all up in my face
Move out the way, bitch, give me some space
Gettin' ready, time to pick up the pace
All the ladies like her are boomin' to the bass

Hot civil night to the dancefloor hurry
Fucks my drink, so now I'm all dirty
Sweatin' and grimin', feelin' filthy
Smack the boys, I'm feeling naughty
My eyelid's choosin' rebels phase (?)
I'm 19, and I made my own ways
Yeah, sure I get lazy or stuck in a haze
But when I'm hot, I can go for days

A boy like you, new black and white (?)
You'll never know what I'll do or like
Yo, there's one difference, just at night
That's when you see the mania take flight (?)
See me in a tracksuit, or in a dress
Lookin' all grungy, or like a princess

On my concerts I always impress
Can't read my funds 'cause I got no stress (?)
Used to run rowdy on Miami beach
Poppin' them pills 'til I lost my speech
I learned my lesson, now I don't preach
But I'll eat candy like it's a peach

Okay
Okay
Come on
Okay
Okay
Okay

Let's-le-le-let's let's go, let's go
Spank it, s-spank it, fuck fuck it
Switch i- swi swi switch it up
Come on fellas, come on fellas
Bust bus-bust bust bust a nut
Spank i-i-it spank it, fuck fuck it
Swi-tch-tch switch it switch it up

Come on come on come on fellas, bust bu-bust bu-bu-bust a nut
Spank it, fuck it, switch it up
Come on fellas, bust a nut
All the ladies with a slim slim waist
Lemme see you work that booty bass
Spank it, fuck it, switch it up
Come on fellas, bust a nut
All the ladies with a slim slim waist
Lemme see you work your body bass
