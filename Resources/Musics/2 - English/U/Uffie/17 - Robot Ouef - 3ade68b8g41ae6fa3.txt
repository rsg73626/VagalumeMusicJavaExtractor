ROBOT OUEF

Got up this morning
and thought about what was I doing last night...........

I met a boy, the kind I like
so I took him on this ride.........

I had some fun,
the time was right
and you know Im pretty wild..........

Love is just a game you know it,
and we all like to play

My responsibility stayed in PARIS
tonight Im gonna play.....

You got yourself a good girl
so move it
before I get out the way (and he did)

You dont have to buy me drinks
(I'm UFFIE and I shine)
Follow me to backstage, right here we're gonna have a good time..

We are young and we hot
we got skills to make us pop
I want you and you want me so lets not wait to fall in love

Seen a few crazy things with my pretty green eyes
I aint afriad to talk about how far we going by night

Im arriving in the club I get drunk and I get drugs
Faces booming on sub I lay my vocals on the dub

Now we rock we dont stop
We drop songs to keep you HOT

In the front in the back
Watch me get it on like that

Im the shit
Im a freak
Now everybody get on this
Move yer waist and rock yer hips

And (??) To the Ed Rec Hits

Robot Ouef (x4)

Rock and dont stop
And we rocking non stop

We taking (??)
Rocking all around the clock

The substance is on my brain
And I gotta do it again

Im getting late to catch the plane
Its not the END of my weekend

Everybodies on my back
I gotta do this right

I got to give them motherfuckers something good tonight

Im back from tour with my friends it feels like I never stop
A few hours of sleep and Im already back on the track

Cuz there is no time to loose
We rocking around the clock

130 BP
and we think inside the speaker box

Like the JR MAFIA
Im here to get the money

I got dope beats from my FAMILIA
Im taking it honey

At the club and the hotels sometimes with my homies
Getting paid from the club
We come back with your lady

If you dont like what I keep talking about
Turn this shit off

We aint fucking we still about what makes you pop that head off

And if you hate it, its cuz you not hot
As the ED BANGER Crew

Cuz from Tokyo to Skandinavia they say
Ed BANGER crew
