ALL WE ARE

Suddenly there's a man with a gun at the door
You shout, "What have you come for?
Who have you come for?"
It's too late, I'm too gone
Now he's right there on time 
As he shoots in your side
And you beg and you plead
And he screams, "Get on your knees!
Shut up! You've accomplished nothing.
You are nothing, no one."

Give me a purpose
An answer
A point to this life
Cuz all that matters now is we're gonna die so hold on tightly

If all we are is all we know
Then yes my dear, we die alone
If all we are is all we know
Know this my dear, you gave me hope

Wake up
Alarm's like ticking like time bombs
Quick, look at your bed clock
It's only a dream
Breathe a sigh of relief
Now what do you see?
Do you believe in you and me?
Like the blind man said
Just close your eyes and open your mind to truly see

Give me a purpose
Give me an answer
A point to this life
Cuz all that matters now is we're gonna die so hold on tightly

If all we are is all we know
Then yes my dear, we die alone
If all we are is all we know
Know this my dear, you gave me hope

I'm the devil at your death bed
The ghost in your machine
Whoever's calling the shots fell asleep at the wheel
You ran over my heart and split both of my heels
It's all in your head
And life's all in your head
And I know it's so sad to bear

If all we are is all we know
Then yes my dear, we die alone
If all we are is all we know
Know this my darling dear, you gave me hope
If all we are is all we know
Know this my dear, I loved you
