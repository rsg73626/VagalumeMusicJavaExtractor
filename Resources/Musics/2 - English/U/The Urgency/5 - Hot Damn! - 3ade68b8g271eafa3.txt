HOT DAMN!

She's dancing in those photographs. 
She's having fun and lots of laughs.
I thought I told you, boy, 
when it hits this low it lasts.
Well I waited for the storm to pass, 
I clung and held tight to the mast.
But all the while I wished it crept 
and sank with me.

Called you on the phone
You were not alone
Busy dancing, love, 
with a boy that looked like me.

Put your hands in the air, no more dancing on the furniture.
Put your hands in the air, can we please get your signature?
Miss, you're gonna be a star! Only hope you don't fall.
Put your hands in the air, no more dancing on the furniture.
Put your hands in the air, can we please get your signature?
Hot damn! You've taken this too far, only hope you don't fall!

She's running with a whole new crowd. 
And if you see her, you'd feel proud.
If only you could see 
past that darkest patch of cloud.
She tried to save you're fragile heart,
But you're not strong when you're apart
I thought I told you boy, 
time to set sail, time to start!

Called you on the phone
You were not alone
Busy dancing, love, 
with a boy that looked like me.

Put your hands in the air, no more dancing on the furniture.
Put your hands in the air, can we please get your signature?
Miss, you're gonna be a star! Only hope you don't fall.
Put your hands in the air, no more dancing on the furniture.
Put your hands in the air, can we please get your signature?
Hot damn! You've taken this too far, only hope you don't fall!

Put your hands in the air, but don't you dare dance on the furniture!!!
Put your hands in the air, can we please get your signature?
Miss, you're gonna be a star! Only hope you don't fall.
Put your hands in the air, no more dancing on the furniture.
Put your hands in the air, can we please get your signature?
Miss, you're gonna be a star! Only hope you don't fall far.

But if you do don't you go breaking your neck 
'cause I don't feel much like bringing the net
Hot Damn! Think how we watch
