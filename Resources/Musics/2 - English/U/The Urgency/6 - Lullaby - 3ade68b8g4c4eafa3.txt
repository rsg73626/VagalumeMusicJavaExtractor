LULLABY

She left me on your birthday
But all I could think of was you
So then I fled far from that place
Thinking it's too good to be true
It was

Already the sound of your footsteps
Picking up snow in your driveway
Is making my heart pound
I'm seeing sideways, I'm missing you

A white chalk outline surrounds me
A death aura left over from the night I should've died
It's a shame he didn't cut me when he well had the chance
'Cause this subway home is a lonely ride

My heart is bleeding
My soul is teething, ready to break away
From this new life
A newborn ready to die

Allow the expound of my hindsight
Cause Doc's making rounds
And its not looking too bright
Just let me sleep, know I am fine
Knowing you love me

A white chalk outline surrounds me
A death aura left over from the night I should've died
It's a shame he didn't cut me when he well had the chance
'Cause this subway home is a lonely ride

My heart is bleeding
My soul is teething, ready to break away
From this new life
A newborn ready to die

Already the sounds of your footsteps
Making their way up into my room
Its making my heart pound
I'm so glad to see you, baby doll
