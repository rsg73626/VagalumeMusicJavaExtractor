REVOLUTION

It's so obvious
The tone you're taking with me makes it's hits
Pinpoints the weak spots in my tympanum
You're love is deafening and oh so very dumb

Can you hear it now
The siren song before the final bow
The dying screams before my ears give out
Ironic how I actually said I'd miss the sound

Of your voice
Like a lamb's
Soothing close
Making plans

Revolution, will you save us, will you take us so far away
Make us more, make us whole
Strip us bare of all desire

But if the mood should hit you
Hell I wouldn't mind a bit
Just give it a taste, it might abate
The heartache i feel deep inside of you

We were kids back then
We could never truly understand
That there may never be the blinding light
Perhaps no tunnels ever led to gates of white

But your voice
Soothing close
Like a lamb's
Gave me hope

Revolution, will you save us, will you take us so far away
Make us more, make us whole
Strip us bare of all desire

You said you had enough
Hell that's all you had to say
All these bold-faced stuntas
Won't know what's coming for them
You better believe we're biting at their heels

Revolution, will you save us, will you take us so far away
Make us more, make us whole
Strip us bare of all desire
