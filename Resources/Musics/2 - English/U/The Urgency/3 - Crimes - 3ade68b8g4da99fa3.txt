CRIMES

Remember
when we were young
and so in lust
the hard times could never keep us down
you had me
wrapped around your finger
till I let it linger
you think I'd blame myself

honey won't you let me help you
get your facts straight
I'm doing time for a crime I did not commit
Surely you believe I'm not the man I know I am,
why else would this be over now?

and why are you waiting in the crowd??

I'm older, now I see where I went wrong
but I can't help it
I'm addicted

she's got coca leaves for eyes
and knives between her teeth

honey won't you let me let you let go
honey won't you let me let you go

honey won't you let me help you
get your facts straight
I'm doing time for a crime I did not commit
but if I did wasn't sorry so forget that shit
why else would this be over now?
