STOP!

Hey you!
Yeah you!
Is it true?
Were your best days in school?
When you had no responsibility?

Now it's time to step up,
Time to step up at bat
Yet you fear that you lack the ability

I'm slowin down my words for you
These past few songs I've spoke far too loosely
Slowin' down my mouth for you
I promise I'll deliver smoothly

Don't you worry
I'm sure they'll love you

Stop!
Why wont you let it go?
It hurts to see you so!
Assuming that you know,
Stop!
Why wont you let it go?
That youve been giving us false hope
assuming that I no
so stop assuming that I dont

stop! stop! stop!

Hey you!
Yeah you!
So it's true!
Your best days were in school,
Where you had no accountability

Now it's time to step up
Time to step up at bat
Yet you fear that you lack the resiliency

Don't you worry
I'm sure they'll love you
Don't get scared now
Show some spine!

Stop!
Why wont you let it go?
It hurts to see you so!
Assuming that you know,
Stop!
Why wont you let it go?
That youve been giving us false hope
assuming that I no
so stop assuming that I dont

stop! stop! stop!

so I let it go
Let it all dissolve around me
This picture perfect world we painted
so I let it go
Let it all dissolve around me
This picture perfect world we painted

Stop!
Why wont you let it go?
It hurts to see you so!
Assuming that you know,
Stop!
Why wont you let it go?
That youve been giving us false hope
assuming that I no

why just you stop
why you let me stop
why I can't you stop

So stop assuming that I dont

stop!
