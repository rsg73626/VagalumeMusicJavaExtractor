MEMORIES

I haven't seen you in so long
These past few months I've been down to the wire
I thought I'd reach you by landline
But your voice sounds even further than it did before
You tell me that you're gone

Wait, all you lose with age
Are looks and faded memories
Better off just left that way
Time is only on your side
Until it takes your better days
And washes them away

I haven't seen you in so long (so long)
These past few years it seems have treated you well
I thought by now that I'd see it (see it)
But by the tone of your voice I can tell
You don't know me anymore

Wait, all you lose with age
Are looks and faded memories
Better off just left that way
Time is only on your side
Until it takes your better days
And washes you away

Like an avalanche
Or the rising tide
It will take you away
Like a speeding car
Ohh

Wait, all you lose with age
Are looks and faded memories
Better off just left that way

Wait, all you lose with age
Are looks and faded memories
Better off just left that way
Time is only on your side
Until it takes your better days
And washes them away
