ROOFTOPS

Step by step
I climb to you
floor by floor
steps ascend up to the roof
I must be dreaming

'cause when I close my eyes
it takes me back to city skylines
to summer night I spent inside
...of you

here on your rooftop
the moment is right
we'll come together, light up the night
Over the rooftops
and under the sky
when I'm around you I get high

back to ground again
like snow I'm falling
my heart beat races back up the stairs
but you're never there waiting

but when I close my eyes, it takes me back to city skylines
to summer nights I spent inside of you.

in your eyes I see for miles

in your eyes I see for miles
