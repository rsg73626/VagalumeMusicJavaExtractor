MOVE YOU

When the lake you let wakes up 
And recalls you're finally home
You won't have time to right the wrongs
and you'll be sorry

I tried so hard to move you
to make you feel as I do,
but the ground bellow's not sound now. 
Babe, it's giving way

And when your knight
in armor falls,
Will you follow?
But when you opened up his head
the suit was hollow

I tried so hard to move you
to make you feel as I do,
but the ground bellow's not sound now
Babe, it's giving way

… Ride the horse he said, Notorious, Notorious
… Ride the horse he said, Notorious, Notorious

When I am king you'll have your crown and I will burn it

I tried so hard to move you
to make you feel as I do,
but the ground bellow's not sound now. 
Babe, it's giving way
