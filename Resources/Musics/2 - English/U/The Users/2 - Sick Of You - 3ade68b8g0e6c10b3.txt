SICK OF YOU

Don't want to fight with you
Don't even want to talk to you
Well I wish I had never met you girl
You're always trying to rule my world

Sick of you like I've never been sick before

Always hanging around
Always trying to please
Well all you seem to be is terminal disease

I don't stand for nothing
I believe we're through
I'm sick of everything
But most of all its you, its you, its you... babe

When you're with me
You're like a bitch on heat
People like you
Are all out on the street

I can get you out of my soul
I can get you out of my heart
But my head is trying to tell me
That we are never going to part
