(I'M) IN LOVE WITH TODAY

Got a chain reaction into my brain
White hot fever burning out through my veins
I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm taking the blame
I won't listen no more coz I'm in love with today

Sometimes I feel more than dead or alive
But I realise that I'll always survive
Don't ever look back life's much too fast
Another thing I hate is living in the past

Future plans don't mean a thing
I don't care what tomorrow may bring
I don't care what people say
Don't even listen coz
I'm in love with today hey hey

Ah you better believe it
Won't take no more of your shit!
