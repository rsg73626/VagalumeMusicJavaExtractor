DEATHWALKER

Light fades and the shadows lengthen...

An age with only death as ones company 
Would disguise any face in a mask of insanity
And she wore, wore it too, as she unbolted the gates
A senseless act which can never be undone

Jaws of death, stretched wide open
Escaping souls surge and flood this world

You shall walk again, let my voice lead you
In the lifeless we found a new home
And death is just the beginning 
In the crucible of the undead
Undead, undead

One shadow, growing stronger than all
Armed with her unholy tools and black arts
A baleful instrument to combat the living
The ultimate hammer of injustice

For every mortal that falls
Another of us will be born

You shall walk again, let my voice lead you
In the lifeless we found a new home
And death is just the beginning 
In the crucible of the undead
Power we do not need, we are power
Our empire of bones will prevail
Because death is just the beginning 
In the crucible of the undead
Undead, undead

The burning eye, soulkeeper, deliver us, grant us strength
At last the dim light of mankind 
Flares up against the black tide of revenants

You shall walk
Imprisonment it wanes
The wards are fading
And can never last
You shall

You shall walk again, let my voice lead you
In the lifeless we found a new home
And death is just the beginning 
In the crucible of the undead
Power we do not need, we are power
Our empire of bones will prevail
Because death is just the beginning 
In the crucible of the undead
Undead
