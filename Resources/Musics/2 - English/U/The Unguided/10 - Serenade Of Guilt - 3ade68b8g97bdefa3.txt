SERENADE OF GUILT

Don’t waste my time, or rather don’t waste
The time you’ve been granted with me
When it’s all said and done (said and done)
Would you have done more than you’ve said?

You try to fashion your citadels against time,
But they will be nothing but your prisons
You’re at the point where life is taking more than giving
Cause youth is wasted on the young

Every breath you take is stolen

If I was life I would leave you
Never trust in me ‘cause I’ll deceive you
Like a phantom I will always haunt you
And you are running out of miracles

Morality is one great glass world which could be utterly
Shattered by one act
If you paint an armless being (armless being),
Remember it has to exist like that forever

You don’t have enough tears for what I’ve done to you
A perfectly broken dream
You don’t have enough tears for what I’ve done to you
Perfectly broken
Perfectly broken
A perfectly broken dream
