THE MIRACLE OF MIND

Everything is dynamic
And synergic systems
A fractal resonance created
Everything that you see
And no dead prophets can give you the answers, 
That we already have
Animal became man
And man became machine
Evolution

It's the miracle of mind
I say man you're god
You are god
It's the miracle of mind
I say man you're god
You are god

Through eternities
All million years
We are kings in our own time
It's more than a miracle 
I say man you're god
You're god

Mohammed, buddha, jesus
Speak the truth with complicated words
But the secret fit
In a human equation
When reality ends
That's where your mind takes over
