GREEN EYED DEMON

Another angel falls from the skies, smashes to the ground
In a whirlwind of white feathers
Another demon claws his way to the surface
Spreads his black wings as he lusts for more blood

Something expendable was all I craved
To fill a hole in my soul, and I found that in you
You where up against a russian roulette
With all chambers loaded

Everything burns, if you apply enough heat
Everyone yearns, parted from their desire
Your innocence was never an excuse
That dream was yours and never mine...
A misplaced step got me in debt, it´s a debt I can´t repay
Even with all the money in this world
Caught in an impending doom, too late to repent
I´ll run and hide in my castle of cards

I don´t fear to go slow, just to stand still
Shun the sniper marks and barricade the gate
My only protection is other people's silence
I have to keep moving

Everything burns, if you apply enough heat
Everyone yearns, parted from their desire
Your innocence was never an excuse
That dream was yours and never mine
If they find me, they will drown me
In a lake of fire
I will never, regret what I did
Even as I expire

Every word you said was ammunition to me
I emptied a clip into your face to discover your identity
Behind the mask
Behind the ragged mask
A green eye demon
Behind the mask
Behind the ragged mask
A green eyed demon
