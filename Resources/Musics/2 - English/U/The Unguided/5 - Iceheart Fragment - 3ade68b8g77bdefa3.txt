ICEHEART FRAGMENT

You cleaned a skeleton
Out from your darkest closet
What about the remaining ones?
Will you save them for a rainy day?
In your sovereign life
You’ll get plenty of these
Eye for an eye
I’ll take the blue pill
And escape while I can
I won’t be blighted by your infestation anymore

Somehwere deep inside
You can separate right from wrong
You always left ruins behind you
But you also carry it with you…

Once you open the box
Of pandora, there’s no putting
The darkness back in
That’s a bell you can’t unring
Can’t unring
How to right your wrongs?
When the damage is done (is done)
I’ll take the blue pill
And escape while I can
I won’t be blighted by your infestation anymore

I want to give you my world
Everything in my universe
(but) will you burn it down
With the rest of me?

You will always carry it with you
Carry it with you

Your past glory doesn’t redeem your present guilt
That’s the phantom that will haunt all your plays from now on
