PATHFINDER

Just for so long, my barbed wire deflected you
My defenses could never stand the legions of her
As the last hooks were hurled over my shielding walls
I was reduced to nothing and the slaughter was to begin

No time to evacuate
There is not much to be saved at all
What is left of me is yours to keep
I could never hide from something
Fused by my soul and heart
You will hunt me down to the ends of the earth

My last bullet I used to take out the runner
Last bit of strength conserved to absorb the mortar fire
Your hell brand glimmered in the moonlight
While you had a steady chokehold on my heart

I want to give you all the details
There is to find out about me
Will it change the way you look at me
Or will it only make us stronger

When I found the passage out of nightmareland
There was a will and a way for me and you
Before we burn in the restless fires of hell
At least there's a lifetime to explore together

No time to evacuate
There is not much to be saved at all
What is left of me is yours to keep
I could never hide from something
Fused by my soul and heart
You will hunt me down to the ends of the earth

I want to give you all the details
There is to find out about me
Will it change the way you look at me
Or will it only make us stronger
And you stole something I would always give to you
The hunter is nothing without his prey
And you took something I would not refuse you
You're nothing without me

No time to evacuate
There is not much to be saved at all
What is left of me is yours to keep
I could never hide from something
Fused by my soul and heart
You will hunt me down to the ends of the earth

I want to give you all the details
There is to find out about me
Will it change the way you look at me
Or will it only make us stronger
And you stole something I would always give to you
The hunter is nothing without his prey
And you took something I would not refuse you
You're nothing without me

We are leaving nightmareland to pursue our dream
We are leaving nightmareland to pursue our dream
