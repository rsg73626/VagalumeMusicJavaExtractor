BETRAYER OF THE CODE

God damned us

My voice uncovers, reveals your hidden secrets
My songs, they spellbind and brainwash feeble minds
On and on I traveled lonesome roads
In the savage garden of our world
But what am I, where do I come from?
Little did I ever know,

This is the end of everything
(the end of everything)
This is the end of all you know
(this is the end of all you know)

By the dark hearts of my kind
By the fire in my mind
Forsaken, I'll never be
I am to live to the end of the world
And I don't even know what I am

Dream after dream portrayed twins in terror
Their emerald eyes and flaming hair
One of them was blind
The other walked forever silenced
My queen forever I'll be a slave to you
We'll never be dead to the world again

Bane of the fallen king, victim of her change of heart
Burning fledglings everywhere and the end of men's brutality
Blood tears they cry
As they combust in flames
She must be kept
Even though it was all her doing
Enforcing balance in act of lunacy
Now she stands with me (she stands with me)
Empower me with your blood

"be my angels in a new world order"
The divine offer we declined
A primal force of vengeance; the queen's fall
And the speechless one saved us all
She fed on the mind and heart of the damned
