MY OWN DEATH

You think you’re safe when you’re living your simple fishbowl life
But I’m closer, I am closer than you think

I, the keeper of your time. or what’s left of it…
I’ve counted your every second
Since you first entered this world

I like to sit beside you (and) listen to your heart and thoughts
You always think so much yet you do so very little (you do nothing)

You believe you are the one that
I have forgotten, I have not
I know you and I will never leave you
Why do you always wait
Until it’s too late? (too late)
You want know why I’m here
And where I’m taking you… (my own death)

I observe how well you spend your limited seconds of life
And I’m afraid to say that you don’t really use them well

You misuse loved ones, but once you stop breathing
You all go back to the same thought
And it makes you heavy to carry (to carry)

My own death
“I hope they know how much I cared about them”
It’s my own death
“how much I cared in the court of my heart”
My own death
And you dare to say that I’m the mystical one?
It’s my own death
When it’s you that always waits until it’s too late…

You think you are safe, but I’m closer than you think
You think you are safe in your “own” life…
