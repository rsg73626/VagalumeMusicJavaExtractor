COLLAPSE MY DREAM

Back again, veterans of the same war
Fighting compact darkness
While we wish upon the black star
Man never seems to change,
If you know one you know them all
Just collect your heart and run for higher ground
(we arm) we arm ourselves with all that we’ve been through
While we watch the sun rain down on you

Your only mistake was to let me live
My mind is now a stronghold no one shall enter
And you can’t blind what already can’t see
Now I channel all my pain to you

Don’t speak to me as if I can be wrong
Some wounds are not meant to heal at all
You’ll make the same mistakes all over again
Stick to your guns and fight for what you are

Tried to put myself in the wrong place at the wrong moment
But there’s no power under god that can’t break me
Eerything I hate in this world I find in you
(but) there’s a six hundred sixteen reasons not to care

No one comes to love pain…
No one comes to love pain…
No one comes to love pain, we can only hope to endure it
No one comes to love pain, we can only hope to endure it

Collapse my dream
