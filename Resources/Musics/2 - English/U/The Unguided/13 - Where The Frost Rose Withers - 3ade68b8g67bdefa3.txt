WHERE THE FROST ROSE WITHERS

Trapped under ice too long I broke my frozen chains
The body saved itself when no mind remained inside
The nightmare’s over now and I reclaimed my heart this day
Your eclipse was all I needed, not your burning scars

The wraiths are by my side as I ascend into history
We will all gather there, the dark star blackens the way for us

Hell is frozen, Heaven’s on Fire
Whatever is left is for the Unguided
When the last flower withers and dies
Meet us at the dark side of the sun

Leaving our sacred grounds, heading for the battlefield
These cold plains we know so well, but we’ll take the fight to them
Six hundred sixteen strong, the battalion is on the move
Our frigid hearts can’t calm the inferno raging in our minds

No lamentations can save you now
Your world must fall and we will rise

By the trail of skulls and devoured minds you can follow us
With iron banners we’ll stake out our path
You can follow us to the end

Rally all the misanthropes, envenom our adversaries
We refuse to live a lie, your kind will be extinct
With shattered souls, no regret and black minds
We’ll end your broken world and take the crown
Rally all the misanthropes, your kind will be extinct

The invasion has begun, our last stand
The invasion has begun, the final stand
The invasion has begun, you won’t enslave our minds again
