THE WORST DAY

Speeding down memory lane
I find a lot of grudges to be held
But a few ripe enough, to let go
She hailed like a storm wind
I hardly knew what hit me
My heart was taken hostage
And then it's just illusory

We all know there's no happy ending
Only a varied haul before the bad one
Sometimes you have to lose everything to find yourself

May the bridges that I burn
Light the way on this nameless road
We passed the point of no return
(And) watched the worst day unfold

How is life treating you?
Undeniably better than you ever did
For once I'm just going to call it for what it was
A futile dream, stuffed with naivety
Built on pillars of lies and egoism
You had your reasons, I had my pride
And with my pride I soldier on

May the bridges that I burn
Light the way on this nameless road
We passed the point of no return
(And) watched the worst day unfold

We are not fooling anyone
We are both going to burn in hell
I will book the furnace next to you
And we can argue for eternity
Whoever mistreated who the most
Since there's a dispute on the matter

May the bridges that I burn
Light the way on this nameless road
We passed the point of no return
(And) watched the worst day unfold
And I would let you off the hook
But it's such a complex hook
Better be leaving on my road
Never ask which way I took
