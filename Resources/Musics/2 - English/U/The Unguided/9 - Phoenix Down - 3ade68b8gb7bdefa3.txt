PHOENIX DOWN

In this big panorama of lies, which we came to call life
I’m rubbing everything to find, to find that genie inside (inside)
A state of not caring for my thoughtless wrongdoings
Cause I know by the end of the day there’s no punishment divine
Reckless, you walked right into my crosshair (I walked right into)
Careless I inscribed my name on your heartstone (you inscribed your name)
Loveless I already know my exits
And relentless I enjoyed every second of it…
The sky is the limit and I’m afraid it’s falling down

Don’t you dare to read my mind
Because you don’t like, won’t like what you’ll find
And the more that you resist me
The greater the damage will be

Along came another bright eyed demon
My last stand was always, always versus her
Breaking my armor just to reach the patchwork of my heart
Not caring what she wished for cause in the end she wanted it all
What you see is never what you get and we both know
The sky is the limit and I’m afraid it’s falling down

Through the ashes I spread my wings again
Why am I cheating death when it’s life that’s the enemy?
I bite the bullet and get right up on my feet again.

I spread my wings
My wings again
Why am I cheating death
When it is life that's the enemy?
