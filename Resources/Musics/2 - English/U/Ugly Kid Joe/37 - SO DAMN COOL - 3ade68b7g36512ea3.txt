SO DAMN COOL

I wanna know, why the people are everywhere
and I wanna know, where to go if I get scared
and I wanna be, in a place where no one cares
and I wanna know you
Because you're so damn cool
Yeah so damn cool
I wanna feel like I'm floatin' in the air
and I wanna know if the sun's gonna bleach my hair
and I wanna know, why life's just so unfair
and I wanna know you
Because you're so damn cool
Yeah, you're so damn cool
So damn cool
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside me
Who knows if I'm feelin' all right
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me
Who knows what is runnin' around in my brain
Now that I'm done and I seen it
Don't think I' tryin' to complain
Don't think I'm lyin' cause I mean it
n' all you people don't look at me to lay
all of your blame 'cause you need me
And you want me to go down with the rest
It's just that I'm sick of denyin'
