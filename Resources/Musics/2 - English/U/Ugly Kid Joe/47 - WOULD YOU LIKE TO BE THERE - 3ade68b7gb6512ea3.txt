WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THERE

Somewhere the evening sun
Is falling down, the day is done
How I'd like to be there, how I'd like to share
Somewhere the darkness frowns
And hides behind the ones in doubt
Would you like to be there, would you like to share
With me, 'cause my arms are stretched a mile wide
Under the ocean floor, the sand is crawling up the shore
How I'd like to be there, 'n how I'd like to share
Under the western sky, the days are slowly passing by
Would you like to be there, would you like to share
With me, 'cause my arms are stretched a mile wide, yeah
The more you see, the more you know
The more you see, the more you know
The more you see, the more
Somewhere the songbird sings, but hears there's no-one listening
How I'd like to be there, 'n how I'd like to share
Out in the blackened sea, there's unison and harmony
Would you like to be there, would you like to share
With me, 'cause my arms are stretched a mile wide
The more you see, the more you know
The more you see, the more you know
