Watching, waiting
You know it shouldn't take this long
Leaning, forward
I know it couldn't possibly take much longer
I know the pain moves on
And I feel the same for the wrong
Angels, walking, floating on and on
Breathing, eloquent
I know it couldn't possibly wait much longer
Searching, so long
I know we'll find a way
Reaching all alone
I know they couldn't possibly hate much longer
