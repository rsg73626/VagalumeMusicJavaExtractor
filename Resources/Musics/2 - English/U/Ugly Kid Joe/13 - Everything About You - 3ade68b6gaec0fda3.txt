EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

I, hate the rain and sunny weather
And I,I hate beach 'n' mountains too
(and) I don't like a thing about the city, no, no,
and I, I, I, hate the countryside too!

And I, hate everything about you!
...everything about you!

 And I, don't like a thing about your mother,
and I, I hate your daddy's guts too,
I don't like a thing about your sister,
'cause I,I,I think sex is overrated too.

And I, get sick when I'm around,
I, can't stand to be around,
I, hate everything about you!
 Everything about you!
Everything about you!
Everything about you!

Some say I've got a bad attitude,
but that don't change the way I feel about you,
and if you think this might be bringing me down,
look again 'cause I ain't wearing no frown!
 
I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
Put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe
I know you know everybody knows
the way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad,
well that's too bad,
'Cause I'm havin' a ball,
Hatin' every little thing about you! ha-ha!

Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around

I hate everything about you
