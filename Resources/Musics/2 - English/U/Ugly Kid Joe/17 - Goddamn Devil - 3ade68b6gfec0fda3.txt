GODDAMN DEVIL

Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery
These are the things that will bring you to me
Murder and theft and all of the above
You can bet your life I know what your thinkin' of
I've taken you and I'll take your friends
Don't you worry we'll all meet in the end
Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Trust me baby cause I don't lie

I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, and I do it for free

I know the story about your life
If you killed your brother or you beat your wife
And I am here to punish you
You can't fool me cause I ain't no fool
The time has come to say goodbye
The end is here for those who cheat, steal and lie
There will be torture and there will be pain
Cause this is hell baby, die in flames

I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, Satan if you please
I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, and I do it for free

I don't care about you, don't care about your life
Don't care about your children or about your wife
I'm here to do my job so if you've broke the law
You're checkin' in with me
And you can never leave

There's one way out if you dare
We'll make a deal, you'll grow your hair
As satan's child you'll start a band
And spread the word across the land
