SHE'S ALREADY GONE

She's already gone
Riding the horizon line alone
Chasing down the sun trying to call it home
She's already gone
She's already gone
She's already

Gone and left it all behind
You take yours and I'll take mine
There's nothing left here
Feels like a thousand years
We're just swimming in lies
Don't you want to see it die
There is no closure
This life is over now
Don't you want to see it die

She's so blessed indeed
Knows that when she wants she can make it bleed
Feeding from the hand that shouldn't feed
She's already gone
She's already gone
She's already

Gone and left it all behind
You take yours and I'll take mine
There's nothing left here
Feels like a thousand years
We're just swimming in lies
Don't you want to see it die
There is no closure
This life is over now
Don't you want to see it die

All the colors are changing
Or is it just the way I see
Can you just rearrange me
It's all my fault again and it rains on me
Now the colors are fading
Or is it just the way I feel
All the world's to blame
It's all my fault again and it rains on me
We're just swimming in lies
Don't you want to see it die
There is no closure
This life is over now
Don't you want to see it die
