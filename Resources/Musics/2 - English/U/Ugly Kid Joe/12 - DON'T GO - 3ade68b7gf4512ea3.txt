DON'T GO

written by Ugly Kid Joe and Eric Phillips

This time, this time I love you
Last time, last time I hate you
Next time, ohhhh I need you
Baby please me don't go 
Remember when I met you
School dress on
I never could forget you
And Baby now you're gone
I'm goin' around, around today
Just trying to find the truth
It doesn't really matter anyway
When I'm living without you
This time, this time I love you
Last time, last time I hate you
Next time, ohhhh I need you
Baby please me don't go
I said come on little darlin'
Baby don't you see
I'd never do you harmin', no
It's just you and me
I'm on the corner right now
Waiting for your love
You better make your choice now
Before a push comes to a shove
Yeah things seem kinda different
It ain't the way it was
Remember what your mama said
The bond that lies in us
This time, this time I love you
Last time, last time I hate you
Next time, ohhhh I need you
Baby please don't go
This time, this time I love you
Last time, last time I hate you
Next time, yeah I need you
Baby please don't go
I'm by the phone, I'm all alone
Just waitin' and a prayin' that maybe you'll call
I gotta know right now, should I stay around, should I stay a while
Should I stand here crying or baby should I fly - yeah !
Oh come on darlin', Don't you see and don't you know
I gotta have your lovin', now now I'll never let ya go
I'm lookin' round and round
Tryin' to find that girl of mine
She's so far away
