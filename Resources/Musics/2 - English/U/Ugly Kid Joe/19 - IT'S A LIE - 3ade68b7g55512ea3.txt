IT'S A LIE

Always on the road
You know I'm never looking back
And I always slay the demons
Cause I'm always on attack
Looking to the moon
And I'm trying to find my place
And now I'm looking to the north
And I'm living at a pace
On the tour, on the road
Never stop for rest
Who's the one, who's the one
Who's the fuckin' best
Now I've got to move
And I've got to move on
Now I got to laugh
While I'm singing this song
I hand you love
It's no surprise
Don't step to me
It's a lie
Alive in me for all to see
I am the man
Slowly walking down
You know I'm falling into place
And I'm screaming at the heavens
While I'm looking at her face
But I've gotta move fast
And I've gotta keep my back
Like the vision that she wasn't
Like the girl who never danced
Took my love, she took my heart
She took me to the level
Took my love, took my heart
She took me to the devil
Now I've got to move
And I've got to move on
Just like I said
You try to bring me down
You try, you try, to make me one of you
I am the man
