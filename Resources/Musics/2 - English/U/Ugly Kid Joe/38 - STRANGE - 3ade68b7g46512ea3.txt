STRANGE

All the way from across the sea
From the man to you, from the man to me
Four white sticks with good intentions
Feed the flame for my protection
I want to know what you want
To find what I don't
But now it's yesterday
Falling down a broken spiral
Heed the flame for no tomorrow
Back up on your feet again
Hold my hand, I'll be your friend
Cause the leaves are falling, falling down
Again
