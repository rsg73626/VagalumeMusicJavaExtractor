SAME SIDE

I am looking for you
I have seen the light
I am the fire
Without the one
There can only be you, my child
It doesn't matter who you are
Or what you're gonna be
People from all walks of life
You gotta have diversity
We're all in this together
And together we shall be
You gotta be a friendly neighbor
If you're gonna live next to me
We're all
Livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin' down the same streets
The streets that are all around
You could be my brother
Or you could be my friend
But don't turn your back on me
Cause we'll be here 'til the end
We're all in this together
And we all have that dream
To live in perfect harmony
Like a family that's the scene
Yeah, we're all
Livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin' down the same streets
The streets that are all around
Livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Shufflin' to the same beat
The beat that's all around
Stumblin' down on D.P., keggers all around,
Laughin' at the police as they try to take us down
Hangin' with each other, yeah hangin' with our bro's
