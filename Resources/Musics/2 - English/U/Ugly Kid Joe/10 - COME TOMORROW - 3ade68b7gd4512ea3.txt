COME TOMORROW

written by Ugly Kid Joe and Roger Lahr

About the time I'm eight years old
I met the devil, kept my soul
Walkin' out on lakes of fire and I'm gone
Walkin' in a wonderland
And I don't really understand
The place I'm comin' to right now today
Come tomorrow, you could see the light
Come tomorrow, break it right down to the place you were before
Fifteen years on down the line
I guess you'd say I'm doin' fine
Wandering down that same old road again
Walkin' in her wonderland
But Alice doesn't understand
The place she's comin' to right now today
Come tomorrow, you could see the light
Come tomorrow, break it right down to the place you were before
Move a little slower
You yome a little faster, honey
On your knees, you'll be beggin' me please
As you feel the disease
You're goin' down again tonight
See me runnin', watch me fall
I guess you'd say I've finally found my own,
See me cryin' and wonder why
I guess you'd say its time to die today
Come tomorrow, you could see the light
