OOMPA

written by Ugly Kid Joe

In the beginning
Had to pay for all man sins
Oompa doompa doopady doo
I've got another riddle for you
When you lie in your bed
We'll come in, kill you dead
Oompa doompa doopady dee
I've got another coming for me
If you lie, if you cheat
You'll lie dead, watch your fate
