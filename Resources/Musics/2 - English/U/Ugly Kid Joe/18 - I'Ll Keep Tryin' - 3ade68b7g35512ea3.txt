I'LL KEEP TRYIN'

Written by Ugly Kid Joe and Alan Reed

If I had the time and lotsa money
Then I'd take you 'round the world
'N' if I had a dime for every penny
Then I'd buy you diamonds girl
You don't even know how much I love you
And how much I wanna be
Your knight in shinin' armor, yeah, baby
That's good enough for me
And I'll keep tryin'
Yeah I'll keep tryin', to make you mine
mine all mine
I hope you're buyin', I hope you're buyin'
All of my lines
Now if I was the kind and had a castle
Then you'd surely be my queen
we would live up in the tallest tower
And we reraly would be seen
You don't even know how much I need you
And how much you mean to me
I'm a dog without a bone hear me cryin'
and it's time for you to see that
And I'll keep tryin'
Yeah I'll keep tryin', to make you mine, mine all mine
I hope you're buyin', I hope you're buyin'
