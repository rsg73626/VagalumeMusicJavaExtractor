MADMAN

written by Klaus Eichstadt

Disneyland is the place to be, c'mon baby, just you and me
Hand in hand, to Disneyland, we go, not slow
Happiest place, in the world until a madman grabs a girl
Hand in hand, with the madman she goes
Knife gleamin' no feelin's, axe wieldin', child stealin'
madman is loose... in Disneyland
Come here little girl if you wanna see
Peter Pan's Magic flight on L.S.D.
Up and down, all around, we go
Knife gleamin' no feelin's, axe wieldin', child stealin'
madman is loose... in Disneyland
Madman is loose in Disneyland, he's back here by popular demand
Madman is loose in Disneyland, he'll take no shit but he'll take your head
Surprise, Surprise, I'm comin' at ya' live
I sure as hell ain't Mickey Mouse, I'm a killer in disguise
You can run and you can hide
But you ain't gettin' away 'cause I got you in my sight
Axe wieldin', child stealin'
I'm a mad motherfuckin' man and I'm loose ... in Disneyland
have you heard the news, madman sure is loose
Got you by the noose, have his way with you
Nothin' you can do, headlines in the news
Madman sure is loose, in Disneyland
Disneyland is the place to be, in California by the sea
Sunny day, well A.O.K., for now, and how
Knife gleamin' no feelin's, axe wieldin', child stealin'
