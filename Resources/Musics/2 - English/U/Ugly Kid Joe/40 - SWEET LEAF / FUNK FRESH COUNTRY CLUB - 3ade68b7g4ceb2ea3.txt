SWEET LEAF / FUNK FRESH COUNTRY CLUB

written by Tony Iommi, Bill Ward, Geezer Butler, Ozzy Osbourne (Sweet Leaf), Whitfield Crane and Eric Philips (Funky Fresh Country Club)

When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you, for your suprize
you introduced me, to my mind
And left me wanting, you and your kind
Oh yeah!
Straight people don't know, what your about
They put you down and shut you out
you gave to me a new belief
and soon the world will love you sweet leaf
Oh yeah!
Funky fresh tunes
And you're walking down the street
And you're trying to find the girl
That you really want to meet
You're flying past the reef
And you're drinking shrunking heads
You wake up in the morning
And you wish that you were dead
As you stagger home
In the blackest form of night
The rollers out in force baby
They're looking for a fight
You try to play the game
You try to pass the test
But the only thing in sight baby
Is the sight of your arrest
Jail cell - living hell
Cains off me I'm free
Doing time - one more time
Mine, all mine, all mine
Now the country club is cold
And the country club is mean
The attendants at the country club
Ain't something to be seen
If you're messing with my girl
You're messing with your life
Cause I'm gonna cut you
With a big, big knife
You bet your fuckin' life
Now as you stagger home
In the blackest form of night
The rollers out in force baby
They're looking for a fight
You try to play the game
You try to pass the test
But the only thing in sight baby
Is the sight of your arrest
Jail cell - living hell
Cains off me I'm free
Doing time - one more time
Mine, all mine, all mine
I wanna tell you a story baby
I hope you wanna hear
I wanna tell you a story baby
I hope you wanna hear
Going downtown in the back of a car
Some motha'fucka' left the door ajar
Remember what your parents said
Be home by eight and in your bed
Now as you stagger home
In the blackest form of night
The rollers out in force baby
They're looking for a fight
You try to play the game
You try to pass the test
But the only thing in sight baby
Is the sight of your arrest
Jail cell - living hell
Cains off me I'm free
Doing time - one more time
