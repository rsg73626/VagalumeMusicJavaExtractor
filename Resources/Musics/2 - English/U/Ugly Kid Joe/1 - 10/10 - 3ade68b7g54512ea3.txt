10/10

written by Ugly Kid Joe

Hey, do you finally see it
Wait, we are there
Fate, refuse to believe it
May, I don't care
Ten outta ten die
Framed, we'll try to escape it
Safe, it ain't fair
Wait, we'll try to achieve it
May, I don't care
Ten outta ten
Let me sleep, let me sleep
See me struggle and hold on to my soul
Fallen faster and don't know which way I'm gonna go
10/10 kills
