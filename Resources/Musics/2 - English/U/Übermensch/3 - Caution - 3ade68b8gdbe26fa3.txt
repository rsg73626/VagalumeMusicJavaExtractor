CAUTION

Mercilessly I question why,
your feelings of devotion,
your self sacrifice, your self denial!

Contemplation devoid of all interest,
is nothing more than a guise
for the emasculation of art!

Take caution in the actions of others
they do them not for you!
They sacrifice themselves,
for the sake of their reputations!

All this sugar and charm,
are merely seductions,
for to ease your conscience!

You don't do it for me,
you do it for your own,
to ease your conscience!
