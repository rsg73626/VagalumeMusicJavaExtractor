ON SELF SUFFERING

The abundance of joy,
in one's own suffering,
it's nauseating, me!

The joy of making oneself suffer,
the folly of a fool,
resides in self-mutilation!

[Chorus]
Desensualize!
Decarnalize!
Contrite!
Penitent!
Vivisect conscience, sacrifice intellect!
Vivisect conscience, sacrifice intellect!

You won't get any pity from me,
your senseless self sacrifice,
it's nauseating me!

[Repeat Chorus]
