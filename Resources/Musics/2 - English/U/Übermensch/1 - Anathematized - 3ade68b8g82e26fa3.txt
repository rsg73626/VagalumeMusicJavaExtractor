ANATHEMATIZED

Bastardized life,
Anathematized, for knowlege your feble minds can't handle!
Condemned to a non-existant world,
Of Demons and Satan!

I gladly accept this punishment,
The gift of solitude, catalyzes learning!

Bastardized life,
Anathematized, for knowlege your feble minds can't handle!
Condemned to a non-existant world,
Of Demons and Satan!
