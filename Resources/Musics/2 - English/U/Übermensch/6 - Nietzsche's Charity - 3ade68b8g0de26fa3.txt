NIETZSCHE'S CHARITY

You are botched, you are weak,
You shall perish!
It is our charity, and we will help you to it!

Christianity, is your crutch!
It cannot withstand, our weight,
Bearing down upon you!
You, must, DIE!

Christianity, is your crutch!
It cannot withstand, our weight,
Bearing down upon you!

You're living rot, poinsoning the earth,
With lies and deciet!
We are not fooled by this masquerade of meriticious corruscation!

Hell is not real! Hell is not real!
Your fear is misplaced,
Accep the gift of death,
And help to cleanse the human race!
