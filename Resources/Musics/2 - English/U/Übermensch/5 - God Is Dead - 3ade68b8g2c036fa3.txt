GOD IS DEAD

[adapted from a poem by Agnethe Ouren]

This day [the mob] lives for dreams
we know can't be, this very hour pretending [they] are free.
The Lord is dead, but one god's living...
a new religion's saving souls today!
Its sacred dogma, saying "have my way."
Heaven is considered lame,
you see the holy spirit, of our time is ME!
