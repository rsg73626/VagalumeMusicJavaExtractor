SENTIMENTAL WEAKNESS

Appropriate the weak!
Overpower the weak!
The will of life, is exploitation!

To refrain from exploitation,
is a denial of life,
a principal of decay!

Sentimentality is weakness,
they will walk all over you,
so walk all over them!

Appropriate the weak!
Overpower the weak!
The will of life, is exploitation!
