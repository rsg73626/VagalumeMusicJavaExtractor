VOICELESS

Drag your things you're ashamed
In your back I've found the weight
Of a world about to break
Living in lies, moving with chains
There's no excuse to drain our pain
Staring grey eyes, robbers of faith
Under the flag? s shadow of our fate

How many times?
The question that moves
The blind under those iron trees
I cannot wait!
Until the time makes it disappear

All the political songs I've heard from
The voiceless that still stand
Will you grab their hands?
Will you try some changes?

Just for one more trophy
they're cutting all the strings
Guided by all the greed
That makes men disappear
Just for one more trophy
they're cutting all the strings
Guided by all the greed
Guided by all the greed
That makes men disappear

What could I do?
The question that moves you
To the land of the confusion
You better say
That you were always afraid

But you've heard all the songs from
The voiceless that still stand
Will you grab their hands?
Will you try your changes?

Just for one more trophy
they're cutting all the strings
Guided by all the greed
That makes men disappear
Just for one more trophy
they're cutting all the strings
Guided by all the greed
Guided by all the greed
That makes men disappear
