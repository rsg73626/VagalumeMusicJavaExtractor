DORIAN'S SOLUTION

This is a story of a man who stared at goats
And was beloved by his sons
One day he found a way for his golden dreams

and then she came to my room all dressed in red
put a letter in the desk asking me to relax
"Sign here and you'll be remembered
even when you're gone

Dorian, now you are the king of the world"

She left with my soul
There's nothing left to love but me
Who will hear me crying out for Jesus Christ?

In sickness and in health, the oath was made
No regrets are allowed
Now he misses things that money cannot buy

I wanna give up to sell, please call me a priest
To send her back to hell and bring back the time missed
"It's to late my dear, now you go everywhere with me"

She left with my soul
There's nothing left to love but me
Who will hear me crying out for Jesus Christ?
Dorian would you do it again?
Dorian would you do it again?

She ended with my world
She left with my soul
There's nothing left to love but me
Who will here me crying out for Jesus Christ?
