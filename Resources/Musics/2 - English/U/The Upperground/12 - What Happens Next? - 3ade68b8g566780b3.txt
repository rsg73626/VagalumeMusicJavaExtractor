WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Stop pressing me!
I'm not so strong as you think
Sometimes I feel like I? m wearing a mask on face

I did bad things
Just before you arrive
And I don't guess you would forgive

Here comes the question
What happens next?
I hope you learn the lesson
And hold tight with me
Here comes the pressure
But life still goes on
I hope you learn a the lesson
And hold tight with me

Here lies the doubts
Between our happiness
And the world I have to find out

It's just a matter of time
Until our "happily ever after"
Or until we kill our freedom for a dream
