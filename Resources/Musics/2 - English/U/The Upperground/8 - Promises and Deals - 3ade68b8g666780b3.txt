PROMISES AND DEALS

Can you understand
How much the words have value to me?
How much the words have value to me?

And if it means nothing in your world
How could you understand?
How could you understand?

I'm suffocating between all the promises and deals
That will never become real
No matter how much I believe
But you're never tired of playing with people's lives
I could spit in your face
If you ever face me

Sell to someone else
The city of dreams that you are building
Draining our hope with your speeches

But if it means nothing in your word
How could you understand?
How could you understand?

I'm suffocating between all the promises and deals
That will never become real
No matter how much I believe
But you're never tired of playing with people lives
I could spit in your face
If you ever face me

(If you ever face me)
I can read your eyes
(If you ever face me)
I can see your lies
(If you ever face me)
Shut your mouth

I'm suffocating between all the promises and deals
That will never become real
No matter how much I believe
But you're never tired of playing with people lives
I could spit in your face
If you ever face me
If you ever face me
If you ever face me
