BLACK SHEEP

Immoral, incorrect and undervalued
Your terms are lower than your fame

I like my sanity, so I learned to read
I learned to read all the small prints

You have no power over me
I bet my chances, I'll play your game

From now on I'll be known as the black sheep
as the black sheep, as the black sheep

I bet against your brain
I'll beat you in your own game

And once in your life
you will face
And once in your life
you will face the failure

Bridge
If it's to bring this shit, then stay away
Don't throw on me false ideologies


I bet against your brain
I'll beat you in your own game

(From now on I'll be known as the black sheep
as the black sheep, as the black sheep)
And once in your life
you will be facing
(From now on I'll be known as the black sheep
as the black sheep, as the black sheep)
And once in your life
face the black sheep
