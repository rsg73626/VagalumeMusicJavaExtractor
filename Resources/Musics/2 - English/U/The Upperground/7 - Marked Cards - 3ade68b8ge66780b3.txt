MARKED CARDS

She always gets what she wants
How could you get out?
Shut up 'cause you want too
How could you get out?

When the others say
That you went too far forgetting who you are
It's just a game of marked cards

She always gets what she wants
How could you get out?
Shut up 'cause you want too
How could you get out?

When the others say
That you went too far forgetting who you are
It's just a game of marked cards
