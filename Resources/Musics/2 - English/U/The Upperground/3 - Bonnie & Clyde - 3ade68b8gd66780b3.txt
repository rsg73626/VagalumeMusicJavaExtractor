BONNIE & CLYDE

Something new
Something changed
Kiss of the death on the cheek
When you're different no one cares

(Waiting for your fall)
They are waiting for your fall
(Waiting for your fall)

Took some time to feel and realize
Need to live it all
Moving along
Moving along, hard times to believe in life
But I'll live it all
Pass it along!

Something new
Something changed
Now I know I gotta make it
(Waiting for your fall)

Took some time to feel and realize
Need to live it all
Moving along
Moving along, hard times to believe in life
But I'll live it all
Pass it along!

Our prosperity put a doubt
in the way they live their lives
Me and you, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and you, Bonnie and Clyde


Yeah we are living it all
Yeah we are living it all
Yeah we are living it all
Need to move along


Yeah we are living it all
Yeah we are living it all
Yeah we are living it all
Need to move along

Something new
Something changed
Now I know I gotta make it
Something new
Something changed
