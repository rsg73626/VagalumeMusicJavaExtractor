FEET OF STONE

Feet of stone
They never feared the road
In my backpack the memories of home

The lights of trucks
Warm me when it? s cold
Behind me the footprints grow
Behind me the footprints grow

Not a single tear drops
Even when I pretend to be sad

Stop now
Coffee break
Take a time to take a breath
Roll the compass
Let it stop
I have the entire world to cross
Stop now
Coffee break
Take a time to take a breath
Roll the compass
Let it stop
I have the entire world to cross
And not a single tear drops
Roll the compass
Let it stop

Each new face
I see along the way
Show the marks of a world betrayed

But my feet of stone
Never feared the road
Behind me the footprints grow
In my backpack the memories of home

Not a single tear drops
Even when I pretend to be sad
