INVISIBLE WAR

The faith that should release
Is the faith that repress
The options given to you
Were pre-selected

Polar bears with it? s antennae
Provoke disasters

What you think is what you really want?
The war for domination is more and more invisible
Have you met someone affected by the last plagues?
The war for domination is more and more invisible

Tanks are no longer seen
The weapons are being changed
New bombs are no longer created
But the battle is the same

Whose side are you on?
Choose before it's too late
Whose side are you on?


What you think is what you really want?
The war for domination is more and more invisible
Have you met someone affected by the last plagues?
The war for domination is more and more invisible
