APRIL

April started cold
With winds whistling a melody

And that song that keeps going through my mind
Insisting on remind me of the good times
And that song that keeps going through my mind
Insisting on remind me

April ended up empty
With the silence reciting poetry

It's only a matter of time
Lack of brakes
And willingness to stay on course

Just follow the signs
Fill the tank
And not look back
And not look back

And that song that keeps going through my mind
Insisting on remind me of the good times
And that song that keeps going through my mind
Insisting on remind me
