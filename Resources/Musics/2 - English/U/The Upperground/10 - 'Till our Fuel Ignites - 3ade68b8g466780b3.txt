'TILL OUR FUEL IGNITES

Between lines we insist to dig
hoping to find a hole to breathe
cause I always think on me as you think on you
I always think on me as you think on you
I always think on me
Is it better leave?

Our time wasted and briefed in broken glass
Our time is up and we still are in the starting line
We keep going around
We keep going around
until our fuel ignites

Between lines we insist to dig
hoping to find a hole to breathe
cause I always think on me as you think on you
I always think on me as you think on you
I always think on me
Is it better leave?

It takes time, courage and sweat
And a large trash to forget what it hurts

Our time wasted and briefed in broken glass
Our time is up and we still are in the starting line
We keep going around
We keep going around
until our fuel ignites


We may die trying but we shall live fighting
