FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE

I finally found someone, that knocks me off my feet 
I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete 
It started over coffee, we started out as friends 
It's funny how from simple things, 
the best things begin 

This time it's different, 
It's all because of you, 
It's better than it's ever been 
'Cause we can talk it through 
Oohh, my favorite line was "Can I call you sometime?" 
It's all you had to say to take my breath away 

[Chorus:] 
This is it, oh, I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one, to be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone, 
I finally found someone, 

Did I keep you waiting? - I didn't mind 
I apologize - baby, that's fine 
I would wait forever 
just to know you were mine 

You know, I love your hair 
Are you sure it looks right? 
I love what you wear - isn't it too tight? 
You're exceptional, 
I can't wait for the rest of my life 

[Chorus:] 
This is it, oh, I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one, to be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone, 
I finally found someone, 

Whatever I do, it's just got to be you 
Oh, my life has just begun... 
I finally found someone... 
Someone 
I finally found someone
