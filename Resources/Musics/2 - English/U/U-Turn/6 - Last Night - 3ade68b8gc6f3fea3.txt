LAST NIGHT

I just lost the way to truth
Try to find myself and wish you had told me though
But it feels like home when you leave me alone 
At the end of the day i'm a fool of my own

But if I
Had just a minute to forget
The otherside
And made the words undone I said
After all I tried to get you in my bed
I wonder how to get lost and found 
Without you I'm reject

Where's that shallow thing that makes my life brighter
Can't you see i'm not cool enough to say
