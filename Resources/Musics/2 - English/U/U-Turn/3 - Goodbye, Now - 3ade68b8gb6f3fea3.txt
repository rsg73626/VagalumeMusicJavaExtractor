GOODBYE, NOW

Your heart's been broken
Your memories gone
She took them as a token
And left with the sun

You realize now
Your life was a lie 
You fell into the ground
Looking up to the sky

All you do is cry now
Nothing's really worth
Since she said goodbye now
And left you oh so hurt

Screaming at the stars
Watching passing cars
You see the birds flying by
But all you do is cry
