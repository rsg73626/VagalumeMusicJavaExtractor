HURTING INSIDE

There are moments when i feel i just can't go on, wishing that you are here oh how i wish you're holding me close to you whispering those words "i love you"
But baby you're not there, like you were before. no words of love to hear, i can't smile anymore. Is it finally over? i can't wait any longer. do you ever think of me? cos baby can't you see?
**that i'm hurting inside 
all these tears i can't hide
life is never the same without you baby
i want you to know
that i'm hurting inside
the pain is deep inside wishing you would come to ease the pain in my heart cos loving you just hurts deep inside
Empty moments, these just fill every part of me. since you've been away from me any chance to say how much i care and hold me close to you, let me through
but baby you're not there, like you were before. no words of love to hear, i can't smile anymore. Is it finally over? i can't wait any longer. now do you ever think of me? cos baby can't you see?
**that i'm hurting inside
all these tears i can't hide
life is never the same without you baby
i want you to know
that i'm hurting inside
the pain is deep inside wishing you will come to ease the pain in my heart cos loving you just hurts deep inside
***i want you to know 
that i'm hurting inside
