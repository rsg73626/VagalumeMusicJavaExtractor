RADIO UNFRIENDLY

Turn on my radio
I wanna hear some rock â€˜n' rock
All I get is a sludge fest
Girl and boy bands and the rest

Try another station
Not doing so good
I get the middle of the road
I turn on the news

Radio unfriendly
Playing the same thing over
Radio unfriendly
Collecting your payola
[x2]

Hey kids, I've found
A brand new station
It's going out
Across the nation
Don't need no tuner
Or other wires
Don't need no radio
It's called d.I.y

Radio unfriendly
Playing the same thing over
Radio unfriendly
Collecting your payola

Radio - unfriendly [x4]

I think it's just me
Getting old and cranky
It's all opium for the people
I need something to believe in
Before I stop breathing
