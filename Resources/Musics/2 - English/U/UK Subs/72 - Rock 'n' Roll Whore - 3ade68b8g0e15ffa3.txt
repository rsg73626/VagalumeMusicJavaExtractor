ROCK 'N' ROLL WHORE

She comes out with her pretty face
Fish nets, black lace
You know she comes from outer-space
You just can't ignore her

Said that she has done it all
New york is such a bore
No cbs anymore
No place left to go

She's just a rock n roll whore
She's so hardcore
She gives out pussy galore
She's just a rock n roll whore

Concrete jungles at a mall
Her head is always in the stars
Haunted all the new york bars
Her life is a go go

Climbs into her spaceship
Trying to find a place that's hip
Hollywood sunset strip
East coast is a no no

She's just a rock n roll whore
She's done it all before
Nobody can ignore
She's just a rock n roll whore

She's just a rock n roll whore
She's done it all before
Nobody can ignore
She's just a rock n roll whore

She's just a rock n roll whore
She's done it all before
No cbs anymore
She's just a rock n roll whore

She's just a rock n roll whore
She's done it all before
Nobody can ignore
She's just a rock n roll whore

She's just a rock n roll whore
New york is such a bore
Can't stand it anymore
She's just a rock n roll whore

She's just a rock n roll whore
Nobody can ignore
She's done it all before
She's just a rock n roll whore
