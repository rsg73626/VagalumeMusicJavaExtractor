HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE

Save your sermon, save your conviction
Your holy book - nothing but fiction
Hell fire, gentle persuasion
Just look around you - the fear is frightening

Hell is other people
Hell is…

Said I was a bad boy, I'll go straight to hell
Tried to beat some good in me, I was born to rebel
Grew up with a chip - one on each shoulder
But I found the truth before I got much older

It seems the world's turned lazy
That they've all gone crazy
I start to smile
But in a while
I start to think…

Hell is other people [x3]
Hell is…

So maybe it's me
Maybe it's the age I've reached
I look around
I see straights and freaks
Some people get happy looking at a clown
Some people get crazy, having them around

It seems the world's turned lazy
And that they've all gone crazy
I start to smile
But in a while
I start to think…

Hell is other people [x7]
Oh, hell is…!
Hell is other people [x3]
