I COULDN'T BE YOU

First of all they come along and say “there, put your baby in school”
But I was taught to win this game you must obey each golden rule
I said that I'm too young to die and can I wear my cowboy hat?
They said “wait a minute son, now that's the end of that”

And I couldn't be you if you wanted me to
And you couldn't be me if I begged you to be

They said that you're a big boy now, it's time to set you free in the world
Don't forget that steady job, and don't forget that steady girl
They said you start at nine o'clock and then we let you out at five
And if you act very smart you get a pension when you're 65

I said I couldn't be you if you wanted me to
And you couldn't be me if I begged you to be

Said I couldn't be you if you wanted me to
And you couldn't be me if I begged you to be
