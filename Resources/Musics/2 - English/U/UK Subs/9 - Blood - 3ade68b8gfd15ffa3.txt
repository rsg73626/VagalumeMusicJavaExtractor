BLOOD

Looking out my window
What you think I see?
Another stormy night
On a stormy sea

Another round of bars
Another drink or three
I'm driving down a road called
No mercy

An accident
Just waiting to happen
I'm standing here
On this sterile stage
Paranoia all around
I got my both feet on the ground
The crowd cried out for more, more, more

Blood
They want blood
You got to give â€˜em blood
Blood on my guitar
Blood
Blood
Can't you see the blood?
Blood on my guitar

I wanna see some blood

Blood
Blood
Blood on my guitar
