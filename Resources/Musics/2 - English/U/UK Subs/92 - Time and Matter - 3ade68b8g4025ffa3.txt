TIME AND MATTER

Someday, baby, I'll take you there
Where time don't matter at all
I'll take you to a place deep in space
Where time don't matter at all
I'll take you to a place that no one knows
Where time don't matter at all
There ain't no age limit and no rules
Time don't matter at all
At all

People say I'm wasting my time but
Time don't matter at all
No opening time, no closing time
Well, time don't matter at all
No public opinion makers
Well, time don't matter at all
One day, baby, you're gonna realize
That time don't matter at all
At all

Don't get confused, it ain't deep
Well, time don't matter at all
Care but don't lose sleep
Well, time don't matter at all
Don't you pay no agency
â€˜cause time don't matter at all
They fix time, they don't fix you
Well, time don't matter at all
At all
