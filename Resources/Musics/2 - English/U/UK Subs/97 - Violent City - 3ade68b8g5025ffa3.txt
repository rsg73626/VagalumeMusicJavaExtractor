VIOLENT CITY

We're living in a violent city
And it's a violent game we're gonna play
Offensive weapons, tools and knives
For your safety in the night
For living in a violent city
We survive in a violent age

Boys and girls come out to play
What are we gonna destroy today?
Thieve a car and do a job
You get ten points for hitting a cop

Walking the streets of a violent city
One day you're gonna make your big mistake
Someone more mob handed than you
Is gonna put you in a ward for a week or so
When you're living in a violent city
Yeah, we're living in a violent age

Saturday afternoon comes around
We're all down to the football ground
Two nil down when half time comes
If we don't win we're gonna run

Living in a violent city
We're living in a violent age
Down the elevator, I step outside
With my all situation boots I feel alright
We're living in a violent city
We're living in a violent age
