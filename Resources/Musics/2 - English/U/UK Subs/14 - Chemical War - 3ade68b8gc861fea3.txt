CHEMICAL WAR

Chemical war chemical war, nations to destroy
Chemical war chemical war, future nightmare toy
Chemical war chemical war, and if you should survive
Chemical war chemical war, more dead than alive

They say "we don't use it" but we know they lie
We say they abuse it before they run and hide

Chemical war chemical war, take your little pill
Chemical war chemical war, go and make your will
Chemical war chemical war, here comes the cyanide
Chemical war chemical war, just not on your side

They say "we don't use it" but we know they lie
They try to abuse it then they run and hide
