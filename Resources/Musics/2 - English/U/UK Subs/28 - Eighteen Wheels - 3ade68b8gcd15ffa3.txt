EIGHTEEN WHEELS

Eighteen wheels a-rolling
Rolling down the road
Out on highway one
Waiting to implode

For I am, I am
I'm your highway man
I am, I am
What I am

Look out any window
Open any door
You'll see me riding by
Down the golden shore

I am, I am
I'm your highway man
I am, I am
What I am

Some drive up to heaven
Some drive down to hell
I'm on highway number one
There's no one here to tell

And I am, I am
I'm your highway man
I am, I am
What I am

Eighteen wheels a-rolling
On highway number one
San diego to spokane
On my whiskey run

I am, I am
I'm a highway man
I am
What I am
