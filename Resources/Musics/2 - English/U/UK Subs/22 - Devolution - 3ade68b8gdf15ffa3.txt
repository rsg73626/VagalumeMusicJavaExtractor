DEVOLUTION

Dehumanise - devolution
Marginalise - devolution
Deforestise - devolution
Terrorise - devolution

The mother of revolution
You know the prize of everything
And the value of nothing

Live is cheap - devolution
You're in the way - devolution
To the corporation - devolution
You're just human waste

(devolution) is the mother of revolution
You know the prize of everything
And the value of nothing

Dehumanise - devolution
Marginalise - devolution
Terrorise - devolution
Deforestise - devolution

The mother of revolution
You know the prize of everything
And the value of nothing
