BLUES

The more I try, the harder it gets with you
Up day and night and day but I still don't have a clue

I need another blue [x3]
To get through to you

If someone told me that you'd be here
I die of fright or freeze in fear

I need another blue [x3]
To get through to you

When I come down to your side of town
I always get a buzz just knowing you're around

I need another blue [x3]
Oh
