LIMO LIFE

I'm sitting here and I wonder why
Could this be true
I'm a dog I am selfish
And did I really do this to you
One day I'll wake up from this dream
And I'll wonder where I am
This God forsaken everybody's taken
It's a nowhere land

All I need is a little bit of action
You can't take five in this limo life
So what's the satisfaction

The rock and roll hall's downtown
They don't know my name
I could be Valentino
To them it's just a game
I stand naked on the street
I scream 'til I'm blue
Nobody sees nobody hears
I'm only passing through

All I need is a little bit of action
But you can't take five in this limo life
So what's the big attraction
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't look at me so seriously
What did I say
I am lost then I'm found
Doesn't matter anyway
One day I'm gonna break on through
To the ....??......???
'Til that day comes along
Down the road I go, just looking

All I need is a little bit of action
But you can't take five in this limo life
So what's the big attraction

All I need is a little bit of action
But you can't take five in this limo life
So what's the big attraction

All I need is a little bit of action
But you can't take five in this limo life
So what's the big attraction

All I need is a little bit of action
But you can't take five in this limo life
So what's the big attraction
