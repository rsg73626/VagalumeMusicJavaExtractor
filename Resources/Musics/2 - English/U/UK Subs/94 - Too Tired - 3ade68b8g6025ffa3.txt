TOO TIRED

I wanna get high, you wanna stay low
You're tired, tired, tired tonight
I wanna get some, do you wanna come?
Are you tired, tired, tired tonight?
What do you want, I'll get you some
If you're tired, tired, tired tonight
Come on, girl, I gotta run
And you're tired, tired, tired tonight

Can't you see there's something wrong with
If you're tired, tired, tired tonight
Come on, babe, I wanna go
Tired, tired, tired tonight
I wanna go, I wanna go
We're tired, tired, tired tonight
Come on, babe, cut it out
Tired, tired, tired tonight

All you wanna do is sit around
Are we tired, tired, tired tonight?
Don't tie me up and I won't tie you down
If you're tired, tired, tired tonight
Come on, baby, don't hang about
Don't be tired, tired, tired tonight
I wanna jump, I give you something
But you're tired, tired, tired tonight

I wanna go, I wanna go
Tired, tired, tired tonight
Come on, girl, let's work it out
But you're tired, tired, tired tonight
I wanna see what's it all about
But you're tired, tired, tired tonight
Come on, babe, don't be a coward
Tired, tired, tired tonight

Too tired [x4]
