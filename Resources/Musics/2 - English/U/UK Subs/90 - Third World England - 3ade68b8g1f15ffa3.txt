THIRD WORLD ENGLAND

There's people dying of starvation
Children thrown on the streets and worse
There's torture and retribution
Has the third world come to us?

Third world - (third world) - third world england [x2]

Road rage and city crime
Bus drivers stabbed to death
Bouquets and flowers on every corner
Someone's taken their very last breath

Third world - (third world) - third world england [x2]

Young girls raped, petrol bombs
Everyday shoot outs in down town bars
Mortality rates climb and climb
First world country, third world crime

Third world - (third world) - third world england [x4]
