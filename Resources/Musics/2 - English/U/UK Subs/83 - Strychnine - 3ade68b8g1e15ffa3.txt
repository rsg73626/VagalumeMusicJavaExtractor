STRYCHNINE

Some folk like water
Some folk like wine
I like the taste of
Straight strychnine

You may think it's funny
That I love this stuff
But if you've tried it
You can't get enough

Wine is red
Poison is blue
Strychnine is good
For what's ailing you

Said wine is red
Poison is blue
Strychnine is good
For what's ailing you

If you listen to what I say
You'll try strychnine one day
It'll make you jump
Make you shout
It may even knock you out

Strychnine [x4]
