TOMORROW'S GIRLS

Well, I got a little girl
She only lives down the street
And she's got a little something
She's gonna knock you off your feet
Well, I said I wanna buy some
And she told me that I could
Said first you better try some
Cos it may not do you good

Well I feel a lot better than I did before
A whole lot better when I'm out on the floor
Feel so good, I know when
Look out girl, here it comes again

Well, tomorrow's girl, she ain't pre-programmed
â€˜cause now you took a liberation that she won't understand
You're out there drinking, your ice cold beer
Well tomorrow's girl, is gonna piss it in your ear

Well I feel a lot better than I did before
A whole lot better when you're out on the floor
Feel so good, I know when
Look out girl, here it comes again

Tomorrow's girl
Ain't no factory girl
And she don't wanna live
In a nine to five world
You're out there slaving
On your factory floor
But tomorrow's girl
She wants a lot more

Well you feel a lot better than you did before
A whole lot better when you're out on the floor
Feel so good, I know when
Look out girl, here it comes again
