UNIVERSAL

One's got a gun, the other's got a bigger one
Both have a set of rules
One's got an army, the other's got a bigger army
Both are led by fools

Assholes are universal
One size fits all
Assholes are universal
Universal asshole

Peace is for some, war is for everyone
Just pick up a gun
Shoot your brother, shoot your father
If you only had one

Assholes are universal
One size fits all
Assholes are universal
Universal asshole

We got a new frequency
It's loud and clear
A universal language
Radio without fear

Assholes are universal
One size fits all
Assholes are universal
Universal asshole
