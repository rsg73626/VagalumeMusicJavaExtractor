CHILDREN OF THE FLOOD

Shall we say that man has had his day
No more history, it's over
The struggle has begun
For generations to come
No more honey, no more clover

Flood waters cover land
From horizon to horizon
All your cattle washed away
Along with your possessions
Politicians talk about it
Forgetting there's a crisis
They take the money
Still the water's rising

We're all children of the flood
Too late, too late for talking
We're all children of the flood
I guess you better start walking

Politicians talk about it
Water just gets higher
They just tall ya
There's nothing they can do
The population grows
And the earth keeps shrinking
There's no land left
For me and you

We're all children of the flood
Too late, too late for talking
We're all children of the flood
I guess you better start walking
