FACE THE MACHINE

Face the machine
It's the thing that made you
Face the machine
It's the beast that bred you
Face the machine
It had so much faith in you
Face the machine
Now it will destroy you

The innocent
The insane
The honest and the deviant
[x2]

Fight the machine
Before it turns on you
Fight the machine
It will only use you
Fight the machine
It can only cheat you
Fight the machine
It has just aborted you

The innocent
The insane
The honest and the deviant
[x2]

Face the machine
And then you can use it
Face the machine
And you can abuse it
Face the machine
And it will answer to no-one else
Face the machine
And then you can face yourself

The innocent
The insane
The honest and the deviant
[x4]
