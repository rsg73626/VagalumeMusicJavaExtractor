LET'S GET DRUNK

Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Why does the pressure get to me
Why does life have to be
So fucking irritating
Everybody yells at me
Tells me what I wanna be
So frustrating
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
I've got Harvard on it's knees
Now he's got me on my knees
I need re-educating
I'm not watching your T.V
It always tries to pressure me
Why are we waiting
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
Let's get drunk
