CRASH COURSE

Meet mr. media man
He's got the money, he's got a plan

Come on and get a crash course
We'll tell you everything we know
Come on and get a crash course
Go where you wanna go

Go to hollywood, meet the stars
No gasoline in their cars

Come on and get a crash course
See your picture in a magazine
Come on and get a crash course
See your face on the tv screen

National network, world service
World domination 'cos you deserve it

Come on and get a crash course
[repeat till end]
