PAPERS LIE

Today's papers are in the dock
The jury's out, circulation's up

Papers lie, the papers lie [x3]

Need the headlines, believe them or not
Fat cat gets eaten by fatter dog

The papers lie, papers lie [x3]

Another exclusive from the street of shame
A sixteen year old girl takes her clothes off again
We hate pedophiles, we'd have them all killed
But don't worry none, she's on the pill

We want a free press
Don't need abuse
Don't need your egos
We just want newsâ€¦ but

The papers lie, papers lie [x3]
