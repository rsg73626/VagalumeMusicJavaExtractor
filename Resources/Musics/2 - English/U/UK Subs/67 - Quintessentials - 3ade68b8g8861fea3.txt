QUINTESSENTIALS

Driving my car a little too far right into the ocean wall.
Getting dark, Golden Gate Park in the middle of the fall.

Quintessentials.
Quintessentials.

Light getting dim. 
Mist rolling in. 
Getting close to Halloween.
A knock on the door. 
Nothing but gore. 
Kids shouting trick or treat.

Quintessentials.
Quintessentials.
