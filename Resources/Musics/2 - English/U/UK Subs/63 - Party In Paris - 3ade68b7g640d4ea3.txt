PARTY IN PARIS

There's a bottle in the corner
That's where I'm gonna stay
Just me and my bottle of French wine
We're gonna drink the night away

Nobody comes, nobody knocks on the door
My friends are far away
If the telephone don't start ringing
It's gonna be a bad bad day

[Chorus:]
Ooh la la la Ooh la lay
There's a party in Paris Palais

I turn on the radio
But I don't like what they play
So I put a record on the stereo
Just to pass this night away

It's twelve'o'clock, I can see them now
They're dancing the night away
Little Jimmy's dressed as Fred Astaire
So wrecked the band can't play.

[Chorus]

I can smell the French perfume
While I sit here in despair
I Think I'll open another bottle
And I'll make believe I'm there.

Meanwhile back in London
Seems a million miles away
I'm lookin' at my invitation
With no ticket for a train

[Chorus]
