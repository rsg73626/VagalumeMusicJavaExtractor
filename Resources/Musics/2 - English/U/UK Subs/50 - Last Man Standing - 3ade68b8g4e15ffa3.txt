LAST MAN STANDING

You take the floor
You're gonna take a fall
It ain't so easy
In fact it's hard as hell

Hey mother, keep your 8 ball shut [x3]
You're the last man standing

Give it some revs
Needle's flicking on red
Don't show no fear
You're in the twilight zone

Hey mother, keep your 8 ball shut [x3]
You're the last man standing

Don't just settle for existence
You're a born survivor
Cuz everywhere you look
They're falling like skittles

Hey mother, keep your 8 ball shut [x3]
You're the last man standing
[x2]
