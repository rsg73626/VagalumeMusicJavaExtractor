Off to fight.

Not for King.
(Corporate War)
Not for country.

Of self preservation. 
(Corporate War) 
Or the nation. 
(Corporate War)
War on the pentagon.
War on the pentagon.

We fight in Africa. 
(Corporate War) 
In the Gulf.
(Corporate War)
No war in Bosnia.

War on the pentagon.

War on the pentagon.
War on the pentagon.

Too many promises unfulfilled. 
Too many good men have been killed.

Seems like no one takes the heed, and the bottom line is the worlds full of greed.
