POLICE STATE

There's a road block on the corner
they put up from time to time
They say we need a witness
To a very serious crime 

We're living in a police state
Fear behind each door
Living in a police state
State of marshal law 

Do the police give you protection
or are they just a waste of time
Will there ever be a witness
To a very serious crime 

We're living in a police state
Fear behind each door
Living in a police state
State of marshal law 

We're living in a police state
Fear behind each door
Living in a police state
State of marshal law 

Today a bomb went off in Knightsbridge
Yesterday was China town
They give us a police state
where the guilty can't be found 

We're living in a police state
Fear behind each door
Living in a police state
State of marshal law 

When the trust is gone
something's gone very wrong
when they can't look you in the eyes
when all you get is lies
police violence is all around
pretty soon your town's burning down
with police, drugs and organized crime
when the blind lead the blind
