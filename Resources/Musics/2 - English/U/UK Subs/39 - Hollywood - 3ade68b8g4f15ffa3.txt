HOLLYWOOD

Film the streets, film the city
It ain't big, it ain't pretty
Anti-septic, clean and sterile
Wasted youth, distorted truth

I hate hollywood [x2]

I hate the way you walk
I hate the way you talk
I hate your empty smile
I hate your sense of style

I hate hollywood [x2]

I hate hollywood
And I hate hollywood
[x2]
