SOHO

The streets are narrow and broken down
But there's a heart in there beating
And every freak on every street
Plays out tonight - go see them

Soho, don't you wanna go?
Steaming in soho
[x2]

There goes the king
In a stretched limousine
Passing by the beggar
Every door and ally churning out a beat
Rock â€˜n' roll this is your future

Soho, don't you wanna go
Steaming in soho
[x2]

There is only one place in this world where the world is in one place

So if you think that life's a drag
And it's getting you down
Get out, get that train
Just take a ride to soho town

Soho, don't you wanna go
Steaming in soho
[x2]
