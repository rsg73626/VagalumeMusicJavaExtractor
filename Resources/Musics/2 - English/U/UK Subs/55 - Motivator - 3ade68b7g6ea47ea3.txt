MOTIVATOR

Get excited when we touch
Hey little baby i love you too much
I get excited when we kiss
I don't believe luck can be like this
I get excited when we ride
Oh come on baby sit by my side
I get excited when you say
Oh baby baby please please stay

My motivator come motivate my heart
Oh motivator oh we should never part
My motivator motivate me home
You know I hate to go

I get excited when we drive
Take me down to the railroad side
I get excited at the port
Oh come on baby let's have another snort
I get excited at the show
You say baby we gotta go
I get excited when we walk
And I say baby I love the way you talk

My motivator motivate my heart
Oh motivator we should never part
Oh motivator motivate me home
You know i don't wanna go

My motivator motivate my heart
My motivator we should never part
Oh my motivator motivate me home
You know I don't wanna go

I get excited when we touch
Oh little baby I love you too much
I get excited when we kiss
I never knew our love could be like this
I never knew our love could be like this
I never knew our love could be like this
