FATAL

Fatal, you're so fatal
Fatal, you're so fatal

Suicide victims
Cranks and queens
Like a trial of destruction
Like a cyclone brings

You're so fatal
You're so fatal

No, no, no, here she comes again
Sometimes I think that she's got no brain
There's a chain reaction wherever she goes
A major disaster with a minor dose

You're fatal
It's fatal
Fatal, it's fatal

You heard about the trap that venus laid
Well, I ain't looking for an early grave

You're so fatal
You're so fatal

Fatal, you're so fatal
Fatal, you're so fatal

Sometimes I think I've seen the last of you
But you come back right on cue
You say it'll kill you if I say goodbye
But you give me heart attacks
And that is why

You're fatal
You're so fatal
Fatal, you're so fatal
Fatal, you're so fatal
