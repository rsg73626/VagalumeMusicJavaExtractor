B.I.C

Here comes the rain
Another dole queue day
I'm gonna get some money
Can I? no way
Done to the social
Then an interview
Got my qualifications, they say we don't need you

Here comes the rain
And I'm hanging around
Gonna leave this city
The place is getting me down
Don't care about tomorrow
One more dole queue day
Got my qualifications, they say go away

B.1.c - b.1.c
I don't wanna b.1.c
[x2]

Here comes the rain
It's my big day
I'm going down to the social
To get my pay
Make sure the next time
You're dressed for an interview
Your qualifications won't help you

B.1.c - b.1.c
I don't wanna b.1.c
[x2]
