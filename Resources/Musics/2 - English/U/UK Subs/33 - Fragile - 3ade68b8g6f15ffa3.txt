FRAGILE

I'd like to know what's going on
Everything I do is wrong
Everything I say is out of place
If you smile you'll break your face

Fragile - I don't dare to breathe
Fragile - catch your disease
Fragile - walking on thin ice
Fragile - living a lie

Schizophrenic, I'm paranoid
Everything I do, I have to think twice
I can't stand up, and I can't sit down
Now what do I do when you're around?

Fragile - I dare not breathe
Fragile - catch your disease
Fragile - walking on thin ice
Fragile - living a lie

You run away, I'm all alone
It's Saturday morning when you come home
I don't say nothing, don't even breathe
Just one word, I'm dead meat

Fragile - I can hardly breathe
Fragile - feel my disease
Fragile - walking on thin ice
Fragile - living a lie
