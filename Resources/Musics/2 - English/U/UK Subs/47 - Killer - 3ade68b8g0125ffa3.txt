KILLER

Gunned down in the city
[?]
Next thing is you're running
And the killer's after you

He maybe watching you
But you're out having fun
But what's he's trying to do
Is get a bite on everyone

The copper is a killer
They've given him a gun
Copper is a killer
And he's killing everyone

It don't matter who's side you're on
The killer's gonna gun you down
The killer's never wrong

Copper is a killer
No matter what you say
Put him in a uniform
He'll put you in a grave

The copper is a killer
Given him a gun
The copper is a killer
And he's killing everyone
