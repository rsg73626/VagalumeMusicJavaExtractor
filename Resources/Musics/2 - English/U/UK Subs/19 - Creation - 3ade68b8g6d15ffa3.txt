CREATION

Beware of false prophets!

Blow up bodies, blow our minds
Destruction is what's left behind

On east and west the worlds collide
Battle lines just fade and die

In the islamic east
The slaughter at the feast
Is this your…?

And the only thing that's feared
Is just a sacrificial beast
Is this your…?

Call in the dogs of war
And slaughter the whore
Is this your creation?

While those who don't believe
At best are left to bleed
Is this your creation?

Children who can't be saved
Thrown into an early grave
Is this your creation?

Discrimination and hate
The legacy of mankind
Is this your creation?
