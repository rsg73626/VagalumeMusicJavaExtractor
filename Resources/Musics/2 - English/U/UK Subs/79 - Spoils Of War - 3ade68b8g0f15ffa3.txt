SPOILS OF WAR

The battle field is your market place
Reinforcements for the front
You don't care how long it takes
Just watch the body count

Spoils - spoils of war [x3]
Spoils of war

Decades go rolling by
Another war, another killing
Acquisitions mounting high
Now you're the corporation

Spoils - spoils of war [x3]
Spoils of war

No country - spoils of war
Starving children - spoils of war
Disease and famine - spoils of war
Look at the consequences

Build the walls higher and higher
More tanks, more barbed wire
And when the walls come down
There's always another somalia

Spoils - spoils of war [x3]
Spoils of war
