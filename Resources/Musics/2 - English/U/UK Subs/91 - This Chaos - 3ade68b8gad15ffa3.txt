THIS CHAOS

As kings and queens change places
The castles rise and fall
They call it civilization
But it isn't that at all

It's chaos - chaos: they call civilization
Chaos - chaos: they call civilization

Behind the window
Of a tenement block
So many good people
But what have they got?

Chaos - chaos: they call civilization
This chaos - chaos: they call civilization

Do we have a chance? no!
To realise potential? no!
Do they have freedom? no!
To be what we wanna be
Oh no

The poets write history
The armies destroy
Panic and slaughter
And it doesn't make sense

This chaos - this chaos: they call civilizaâ€¦ [repeat]
