GURU

It's swirling round my head
Everything that you said
Espoucing mysticism
And transcendentalism

What you gonna do when the truth kills your guru [x2]
Your guru

He dresses like a sheik
But lives in heywardss heath
Selling you his saffron lies
While sleeping with all your wives

What you gonna do when the truth kills your guru [x2]
Your guru

He says your aura's too faded
That science is just too jaded
He wants a million for a shrine
He says what's yours is mineâ€¦ is mine

Collecting big fat checks
From all you spiritual wrecks
Saving wealthy souls
While driving his paisley rolls

What you gonna do when the truth kills your guru [x4]
Your guru
