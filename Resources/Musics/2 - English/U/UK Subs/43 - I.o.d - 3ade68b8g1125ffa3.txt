I.O.D

One for you
Two for me
Three for you
I.o.d.

[?] I been ill
Now I'm thought I'm out of control
Somebody strap me to a bed
I got electrodes in my head

It's a job for you
But it's agony for me
Shoot me up with morphine
Now I get my drugs for free

A shot in the morning
A shot at tea
Now all I need
Is a shot to sleep

Nurse-nurse, come and see
What this stuff has done to me
I can't eat, I can't sleep
It looks like it's the endâ€¦ for me
