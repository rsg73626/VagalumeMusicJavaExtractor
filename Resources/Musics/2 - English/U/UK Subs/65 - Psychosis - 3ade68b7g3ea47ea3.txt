PSYCHOSIS

Trade in your sanity for a new reality. 
A psycho walk. 
A psycho talk.
You're a psycho, psycho - Psychosis.

Your mind has gone without a trace.
Ejected into hyperspace.
You're a psycho, psycho - Psychosis.

Little white pills stop the chills. 
Now you're hot. 
Now you're not.

You're a psycho, psycho - Psychosis
