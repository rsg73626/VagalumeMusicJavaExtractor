SHE'S NOT THERE

Well no one told me about her 
The way she lied
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How could I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there
Well let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool, her eyes were clear and bright,her skin was soft and white
But she's not there 
Well no one told me about her
What could I do
Well no one told me about her
Though they all knew
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How could I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there
Well let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool, her eyes were clear and bright,her skin was soft and white
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How could I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there
Well let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool, her eyes were clear and bright,her skin was soft and white
But she's not there
