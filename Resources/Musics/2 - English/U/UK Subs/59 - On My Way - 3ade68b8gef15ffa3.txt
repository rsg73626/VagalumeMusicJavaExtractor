ON MY WAY

This is what you wanna
And this is what you get
This is not a cabaret
And no nostalgia trip
Drinking, stinking
Trip to the bone
I'm ugly, obnoxious
? and defenseless ?

I'm on my way - one thing left to say
I'm on my way - goodbye

You get up there, a beer in your hand
? and you can hardly stand
And now you're all saucy
And you don't give a fuck
Now this is the irony, that you don't understand

I'm on my way - just one thing to say
I'm on my way - goodbye
Yes I'm on my way - one thing left to say
I'm on my way - goodbye
