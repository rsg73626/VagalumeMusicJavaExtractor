YOU DON'T BELONG

You don't belong today
You only get in the way
I can't understand what you say
You're from another time and space

You don't belong [x3]
You don't belong today

You get on your knees and pray
Will inspiration come my way?
You might as well sit there all the day
â€˜cuz you ain't got a thing to say

You don't belong [x3]
You don't belong today

You don't belong [x4]

You don't belong [x3]
You don't belong today
