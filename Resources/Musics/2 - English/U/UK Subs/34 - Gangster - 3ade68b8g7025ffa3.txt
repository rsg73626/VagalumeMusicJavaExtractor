GANGSTER

Gangster, gangster
You wanna be mr big?
You wanna run this city
You wanna own the streets

Gangster, gangster
In your white cadillac
With a telephone and tv
And a bar in the back

Gangster, gangster
Now you're the boss
You've paid off the police
How much did it cost?

Gangster, gangster
You're living by the gun
Found dead in the gutter
With your dark shades on

Gangster, gangster
In a black cadillac
A bunch of flowers
And a box in the back

Gangster, gangster
Just a hunk of meat
One hungry gun
Why do you die so cheap?
