DUNBLANE

A child is born with a gun in his hand. 
He knows one day he has to kill another man.
But that was some time, some place long ago.
So tell me, how can you justify your gun law?

After Dunblane how can you hold a gun?
And say that you are innocent?
After Dunblane how can you hold a gun?
And say that you are innocent?

Meanwhile back in the USA.
There's a massacre 'most everyday.
But that don't give us the right to deny.
A mother of another dead child.

After Dunblane how can you hold a gun?
And say that you are innocent?
After Dunblane how can you hold a gun?
And say that you are innocent?

So are you blind or are you just a fool?
You can't see the writing on the wall.
Guns are for nothing but to kill.
And it's you not the industry who pays the bill.

After Dunblane how can you hold a gun?
And say that you are innocent?
