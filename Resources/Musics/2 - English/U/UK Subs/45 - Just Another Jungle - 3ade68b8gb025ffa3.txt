JUST ANOTHER JUNGLE

Dream of your ideal world, the way you want it to be
Everyday boy meets everyday girl in the dance halls by the sea
When you finally wake up, wake up to reality
Half your life has been and gone, you're still swinging on a tree

Concrete trees
Neon leaves
Auto creatures
Micro feed

Working for the welfare state, the socialist's dream
Working for love or working for hate - it ain't what it seems
Too many people on the make, cutting down your tree
You're gonna make your big mistake if you think you're gonna be free

Concrete trees

Make no mistake - it's just another jungle
