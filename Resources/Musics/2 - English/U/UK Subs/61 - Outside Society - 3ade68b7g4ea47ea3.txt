OUTSIDE SOCIETY

Try to get a job, try to get straight. 
I get a door in my face every step I take.
Fighting back I will always be outside society.

When I jump on a bus, when I ride on a train. 
Just to go to the store can be a pain.
Outside society.

If I join the system. 
It would be just an act - So fuck you I'm striking back.
So I live outside society.
