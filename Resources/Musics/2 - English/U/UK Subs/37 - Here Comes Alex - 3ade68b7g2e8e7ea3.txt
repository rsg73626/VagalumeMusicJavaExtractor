HERE COMES ALEX

at times you only live
like a robot every day
the only excitement in your life
is watchin' your own TV
everyone is a clockwork programme
and nobody revolts
just a bunch of kids
frustrated

when the sun goes down
the droogs begin
they gather 'round in gangs
they get their little blades
and go out hunting

hey hey here comes alex
and his real little horrorshow
hey hey hey here comes alex
got a real little horrorshow

in their crusade against law and order
and a safe world that is not just
they celibrate brutality
violence and destruction
not satisfied until they see
the next victim suffer
and nothing's gonna stop them
in their merciless quest

hey hey here comes alex
he's got a real little horrorshow
hey hey hey here comes alex
see his real little horrorshow

twenty against one 'till they see blood
with their sticks and knives
sooner or later a head will burst
and it's already the next victims turn
while you keep asking god to interrupt

hey hey here comes alex
and his real little horrorshow
hey hey hey here comes alex
don't you go to his horrorshow
hey hey hey here comes alex
and his real horrorshow
