KILLER COPS

You're off the street into your car. 
Step on the gas before too far.
Lights are flashing into your mirrors sirens wail.

Killer cops are showing in your town.
Everywhere you go they're putting you down.
Killer cops are showing, showing for you.

Yesterday we got a speeding ticket.
Now we got grief we don't need it.
Today instead we got a bullet in the back of the head.

Killer cops are showing in your town
Better get running they'll be shooting you down.
Killer cops are coming to your town.
Better get running.
