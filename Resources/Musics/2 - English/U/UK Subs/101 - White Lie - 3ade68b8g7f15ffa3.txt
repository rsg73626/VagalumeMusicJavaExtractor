WHITE LIE

Life's a breeze
You say with glee
But it's the passion
You can't achieve

Suit and tie
The life you lead
But it's your big head
So fat with greed

You waste your life
The white lie will not possess me
A life of worth
Means more to me

Suffering
The people under you scream
Your lack of interest
You're fat and pleased

Upper-class
You're the one I hate
If we had our way
You'd burn at the stake

You waste your life
The white lie will not possess me
A life of worth
Means more to me

You waste your life
The white lie will not possess me
A life of worth
Means more to me

Life's a breeze
You say with glee
But it's the passion
You can't achieve

Suit and tie
The life you lead
But it's your big head
So fat with greed

You waste your life
The white lie will not possess me
A life of worth
Means more to me
