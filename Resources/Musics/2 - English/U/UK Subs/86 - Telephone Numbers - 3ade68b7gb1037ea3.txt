TELEPHONE NUMBERS

I tried to get you on the telephone
But all day long got your number wrong
Then I remembered that I wrote it on the shirt
But I went and got it dirty when I fell in the dirt

Telephone numbers
Getting me down
Got the wrong number
Telephone numbers
Going through my head
But the lines are dead

On the screen we have a good time
Thought I'd call a friend of mine
Come on over bring a beer
What'd you say there's a buzzing in my ear

Telephone numbers
Getting me down
Got the wrong number
Telephone numbers
Going through my head
But the lines are dead

Saw you out in the week
We pass by we never meet
You ring me in not in
Fuck let's talk about the state I'm in

Telephone numbers
Getting me down
Got the wrong number
Telephone numbers
Going through my head
But the lines are dead
