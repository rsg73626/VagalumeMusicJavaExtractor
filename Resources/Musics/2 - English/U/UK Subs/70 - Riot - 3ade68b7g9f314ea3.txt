RIOT

Inner City life
is getting me down
Poliece and gang wars
all over town
Closing donw our clubs
take away our freedoms
Hassle us on the street
for no good reason

Oh oh we want a riot
Oh oh don't even try it

Here come the riot squad
they're closing in
guns and riot shields
and gas granades
see them standing there
in a row
now they're running
We gotta go

Oh oh we want a riot
Oh oh we get no peace & quiet

They got a justice bill
that's what they say
They have the power now
to put you away
Now there were 4 of us
minding our own
We're a riotous assembly
Walking down the road

Oh oh we want a riot
Oh oh we get no peace & quiet
Oh oh we wanna riot
Oh oh leave us alone!
