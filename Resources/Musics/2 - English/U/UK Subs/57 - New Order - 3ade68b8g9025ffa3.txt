NEW ORDER

Have you heard about the things to come?
The side effects of an atom bomb
Have you heard about the disturbed child?
You know this generation a little wild
Did they tell you about the beast?
And the big hairy monsters
Like creatures in a bad dream
Did they tell you about the new order?

Have you heard about the china wall?
When will it crack, when will it fall?
There are no words to find in prayers
To write them down, nobody dares
Will it happen to you?
Or will it be another generation?
Which side would you choose?
When the time comes for the new order

Have you heard about the things they found
While they were digging up the underground
Will history repeat itself?
If you believe in someone else
Will it happen today?
Or will it be another generation?
What side would you take?
When the time comes for the new order
New order [x3]
