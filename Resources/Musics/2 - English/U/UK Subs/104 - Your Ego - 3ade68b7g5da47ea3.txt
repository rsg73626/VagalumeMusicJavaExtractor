YOUR EGO

I don't have to look around I feel your eyes burning holes in my head.
One day I'll be out of here maybe then you'll listen to what I said.

You know I don't do this for my ego. 
So why do I get all this bullshit?

Put yourself in my shoes. 
Maybe you won't get so much abuse.
But you're always ragging me. 
Seems nothing is good enough for you.

You know I don't do this for my ego. 
So why don't you own up and tell the truth?
If I should only do this for my ego. 
I'm out of here and that's the end of you.
