BIG WILD WORLD

With all the booze beer women and the heavy medication
Gonna have to take my self a mandatory vacation
Running out of time luck money and gin
The city of sin that was the city I was in 
Cops where on my tail I might've landed in jail
It didn't matter much cause I was living in hell
And then the words my daddy once said to me
Started ringing in my ears and they set my ass free

Itâ€™s a big wild world and it'll knock you around
Itâ€™s a big wild world and it'll try to bring you down
It's a big wild world but it can't get to you
You got time and good friends on your side you can't lose

I know I called you angel and your name is lollita
I need a shot of tequila and a pint of abitta
I need a walker a stretcher I need an ambulance
I need your girlfriend to come over to my table and dance
I need a bottle of good whiskey and Iâ€™ll go with the flow
But now I can't remember what happened an hour a go
And then the words my daddy once said to me
Started ringing in my ears and they set my ass free

Now Iâ€™m a stranger in danger and Iâ€™m dangerously close
To being dangerously strange and strangerously dosed
I need a towel a haircut a shave and a smoke
I need a cafe please u me poorboy I need a little bourbon and cocaine

I turned to coco and I said its getting late
I gotta find me some salvation before its too damn late
We picked up snizz spooky tooth and the chops
Headed down to chopatoules singing no stops for pops
Ended up at Miss Mays for three days
And when we came to our senses we thought we'd change our ways
And then the words my daddy once said to me
