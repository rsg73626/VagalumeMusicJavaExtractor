ANGELINA

Eating sunlight streams riding on the back of dreams with Angelina
Drinking blue sky wine riding on a dandelion with Angelina
But there's a note on the door saying Iâ€™ll see you never more love, Angelina

Making love to the breeze, playing hide and seek with trees and Angelina
Gonna drown in your direction gonna pass every inspection Angelina
But there's a note on the door that says Iâ€™ll see you never more love, Angelina

I want to scuba in your tuba I wanna fly down to Aruba, Angelina
I want to scream into your lightpost and paint up all your bright toes, Angelina
But there's a note on the door that says Iâ€™ll see you never more, love, Angelina

With your spells and cobble bells
Your magical legerdemain
Your butterflies and wishing wells
You come and sweep away all the rain

And when Iâ€™m down on the ground you know you'll always come around Angelina
When Iâ€™m singing in the sun when Iâ€™m coming all undone Angelina
