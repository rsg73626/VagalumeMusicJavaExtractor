RIGHT TIME

I waited for the right time to let you go
I waited for the right time to let you know
I waited for the right time to let you go
I waited for the right time and the right time is
Right about now

You never thought that it would happen to you
Falling in love was something that other people do
You left so many broken hearts in your wake
Taking me for granted was your big mistake

I waited for the right time to let you go
I waited for the right time to let you know
I waited for the right time to let you go
I waited for the right time and the right time is
Right about now

You used to have such a spell on me
You stripped away all my dignity
You thought you had me down for the count
If there's a price to pay I paid the full amount

I waited for the right time to let you go
I waited for the right time to let you know
I waited for the right time to let you go
I waited for the right time and the right time is
Right about now
