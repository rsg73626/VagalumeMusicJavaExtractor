CAPTAIN LUBRITRON

I was abducted by an alien while I was walking home one day
We took a ride around the sun and then we cruised the milky way
He looked like Elvis Presley must have looked before he died
But he was quite a pleasant fellow so I thanked him for the ride
He told me of a time when battles they would not be fought
Instead of waging wars governments would just be bought
And sold to the highest bidder I said you're such a kidder
Go figure

Calling captain lubritron
Calling snizz

I was talking to an old man 
Hoping that Iâ€™d understand
The only thing I learned that day 
Was that he didn't give damn
I'm holding on for heaven's sake looking for some kinda break
I'll pass on all the bullshit Iâ€™ve had all I can take
I'm trying to do the right thing Iâ€™m hanging by a kite string
Walking on a tight rope seeing what the future brings

Calling captain lubritron
Calling snizz
