THE WRONG DIRECTION

If you go downtown, 
Way down to Baltimore Street. 
You just might see my baby there. 
Yeah my baby might be someone you meet. 
Yeah if you go downtown 
And you take yourself a look around. 
You just might see my baby there 
And the new love that she has found. 

She got the right way 
Of loading up her gun 
But sheâ€™s got the wrong direction 
â€™Cause she say that I ainâ€™t the one. 
She got the right way of walking down the street 
But she got the wrong direction 
â€™Cause she be walking away from me. 

If you go downtown. 
No mister I donâ€™t like to go there much myself. 
I just might see my baby there 
And that might break my heart and I donâ€™t need the help. 
Yeah if you go downtown 
And see a beauty unlike any youâ€™ve known. 
Well you know that was my baby once 
But now I feel like Iâ€™m all alone. 

She got the right way of loading up her gun 
But sheâ€™s got the wrong direction 
â€™Cause she say that I ainâ€™t the one. 
She got the right way of walking down the street 
But she got the wrong direction 
â€™Cause she be walking away from me. 

The last time that I saw my baby 
It sounded so well rehearsed 
When I said Iâ€™ll see you later and 
She said not if I see you first (so get out of town). 

If you go downtown. 
Now mister I donâ€™t want to tell you what to say 
But if you see my baby there 
Could you lie and tell her Iâ€™m doing okay 
â€™Cause if you go downtown 
And you take yourself a look around 
You might see my baby there 
And the new love she has found. 

She got the right way of loading up her gun 
But sheâ€™s got the wrong direction 
â€™Cause she say that I ainâ€™t the one. 
She got the right way of saying I love you 
But she got the wrong direction 
â€™Cause it ainâ€™t me sheâ€™s saying it to.
