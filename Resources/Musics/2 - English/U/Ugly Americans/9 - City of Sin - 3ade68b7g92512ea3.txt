CITY OF SIN

Too many strangers in my bed
Too many demons running around my head
Too many nights in this town
Too many memories trying to drag me down

Take down to the city of sin
Cause I can't stand the shape Iâ€™m in
The lord above won't save my soul
Mister would you pour one more
Take me down to where the rainbows end
Take me down to the city of sin

Too many years wasted my time
Too many tears falling down the line
Too many broken hearts laying in my wake
Too many lonely nights for one man to take

Take down to the city of sin
Cause I can't stand the shape Iâ€™m in
The lord above won't save my soul
Mister would you pour one more
Take me down to where the rainbows end
Take me down to the city of sin

Too many  reasons why I shouldn't stay
Too many reason why I can't stay away
Too many broken dreams lay out in the cold
Too many tales that have yet to be told

Take down to the city of sin
Cause I can't stand the shape Iâ€™m in
The lord above won't save my soul
Mister would you pour one more
This whiskey glass is my only friend
Take me down to the city of sin
 Clammy Jammies 
Music and lyrics by bob Schneider

I woke up this morning 
With my jammies kinda clammy
Saturdayâ€™s a whammy on a Sunday morn
Oh god Iâ€™ll do my best
And I hope I pass this test
Because I wonâ€™t be drinking anymore

Thereâ€™ll be no more drinking in the city
Where the girls look mighty pretty
Especially â€˜round three or four
No more waking up with strangers
No more late night drunken dangers
Cause I wonâ€™t be drinking anymore

I woke up this morning 
With my jammies kinda clammy
Saturdayâ€™s a whammy on a Sunday morn
Oh god Iâ€™ll do my best
And I hope I pass this test
Because I wonâ€™t be drinking anymore

No more drinking in the city
Where the cops show you no pity
And theyâ€™ll beat you till you till youâ€™re good and sore
No more puking in the kitchen
No more late night wife a bitchinâ€™
Cause I wonâ€™t be drinking anymore

I woke up this morning 
With my jammies kinda clammy
Saturdayâ€™s a whammy on a Sunday morn
Oh god Iâ€™ll do my best
And I doubt Iâ€™ll drink much less
But I wonâ€™t be drinking anymore
