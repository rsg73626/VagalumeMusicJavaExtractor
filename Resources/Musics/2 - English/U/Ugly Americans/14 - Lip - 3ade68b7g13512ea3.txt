LIP

Don't give me no lip about my drinking habits
Don't give me no lip about my chasing women
Don't give me no lip about my smoking refer
Don't give me no lip don't give me no lip

Sure you might see me around a quarter after four
Sure I might come knocking baby drunk at your door
I get a little bit then I want a little more
Never really know what tomorrow has in store
So if you wanna tell me how to live my life I guess Iâ€™m gonna say

Don't give me no lip about my drinking habits
Don't give me no lip about my chasing women
Don't give me no lip about my smoking refer
Don't give me no lip don't give me no lip

So you see me with a different flavor every night
You know I like to have a little fun and feel allright
I get a little bit then I want a little more
Never really know what tomorrow has in store
So if you wanna tell me how to live my life I guess Iâ€™m gonna say

Don't give me no lip about my drinking habits
Don't give me no lip about my chasing women
Don't give me no lip about my smoking refer
Don't give me no lip don't give me no lip

I might smoke a little reefer everyday
I know it never killed anybody anyway
I get a little bit then I want a little more
Never really know what tomorrow has in store
So if you wanna tell me how to live my life I guess Iâ€™m gonna say
