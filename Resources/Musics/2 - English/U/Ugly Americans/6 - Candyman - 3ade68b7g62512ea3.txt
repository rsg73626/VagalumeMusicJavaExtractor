CANDYMAN

I'll be the sugar in your coffee baby
I'll be your cup of tea
I'll be that cool breeze on that warm summer's evening
I'll be all that you need

Cause I know you want it
Said you got to have it
Just the way you like it
The girls like candy 
And that's a fact

I'll be your candyman baby
I'll be your sugar daddy

I'll be that million in the bank for you darling
I'll be your peace of mind
I'll be a memory if that's what you want
But if you want Iâ€™ll be here there the end of time

Cause I know you want it
Said you got to have it
Just the way you like it
The girls like candy 
And that's a fact

I'll be your candyman baby
I'll be your sugar daddy

I'll give you good loving like you've never known
Love you darling right down to the bone
From now on girl you're never going to be alone
I'll turn your heart into a happy home

I'll be the candle on your nightstand baby
I'll be your birthday everyday
I'll even be your favorite color sweet darling
I'll keep your blue skies from ever turning gray

Cause I know you want it
Said you got to have it
Just the way you like it
The girls like candy 
And that's a fact

I'll be your candyman baby
I'll be your sugar daddy
