LOSING YOU

Late at night
As I lay sleeping
All the vampires
They come creeping
They drink my blood
And steal my soul

And I don't bother
To lock my door
I just don't care
Anymore
This house is empty
And black as coal

And it's got nothing
No it's got nothing to do
With the realization
I'm losing you

Feel like a captain
Sailing out to sea
And all I carry
Are these memories
The ship is sinking
And there's no way home

And it's got nothing
No it's got nothing to do
With the realization
I'm losing you

And all the people
That I know
They all tell me
Just goes to show
That no matter where you are
