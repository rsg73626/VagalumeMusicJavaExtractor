ELECTRICMAGNETICLOVETHINGEXPERIENCE

Slippin in your silky skin can we do it once again what's your fantasy
Your soft embrace your aftertaste we ain't got no time to waste tell me what you need
Cause you can tie me up or tie me down on your bed or on the ground
When we come up for air don't be scared Iâ€™ll run my fingers through your hair
This electric magnetic love thing experience
Aaah aaah aaah
Might drop you to your knees
It won't do what you please

Baby when you hold me tight I just might make it through this night
Well I can't be your father child but try and I might drive you wild
I've been trapped inside your cherry tree
Ever since you put your spell on me
This electric magnetic love thing experience
Aaah aaah aaah
Might drop you to your knees
It won't do what you please

Pull my trigger scratch my back cause when you do it just like that it makes me wanna scream
I shiver when you shake my rattle I love it when Iâ€™m in your saddle it feels like a dream
This electric magnetic love thing experience
It's a love thing experience
It's a love thing experience
It's a love thing experience
Aaah aaah aaah
Might drop you to your knees
It won't do what you please
