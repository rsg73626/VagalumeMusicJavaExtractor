WHITE IS THE WINE

How does it feel
When youâ€™re caught in the wheel
And the world spins around
Turning you upside down

Do you do your little dance
Take another chance
Do you do your little dance
Take another chance

White is the wine oh yeah
White is the wine oh yeah
White is the wine but
Red is the color of my heart

Tell me the truth
Or tell me a lie
All that I know
Wonâ€™t weigh more than your sigh

Is that a light up ahead
I miss your bed
Is that a light up ahead
What was it that I said

White is the wine oh yeah
White is the wine oh yeah
White is the wine but
Red is the color of my heart

Iâ€™ve got my skin on too tight
And I feel like Iâ€™m turning inside out
And I feel so alive I
Think Iâ€™ll have me another

What would you say
If I begged you to stay

Would you still walk away
Would you take another chance
Would you still walk away
Could you take another chance
