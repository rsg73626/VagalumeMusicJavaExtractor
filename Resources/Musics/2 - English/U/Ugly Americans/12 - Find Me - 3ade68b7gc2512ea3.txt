FIND ME

If you try you just might find me
Look ahead and look behind me
Look underneath the snowflake stars
Far away from where you are
But close enough to plainly see
That's where Iâ€™ll be

And if you try you will
And if you try you might come to finally see
I wish you luck and I wish you could
Find me

Build a rainbow memory
Of the way we once used to be
Dry the ocean and dry the sea
And that's where Iâ€™ll be

And if you try you will
And if you try you might come to finally see
I wish you luck and I wish you could
Find me

If you try you just might find me
Look ahead and look behind me
Underneath these pastel skies
Or somewhere in a lullaby

And if you try you will
And if you try you might come to finally see
I wish you luck and I wish you could
I wish you luck and I wish you could
Find me

Well look underneath the red metal sea
Well worn and fire damaged that's where Iâ€™ll be
I'm cut to ribbons that you'll tie in your hair
Ringed with hope and promise and Iâ€™m everywhere
Wish I could with all my might grab the stars in the night
And when the sun wakes up the sky just to look into your eyes
Wish I could with all my might grab the stars in the sky
