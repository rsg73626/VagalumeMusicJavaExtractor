YOU TURN ME ON

You turn me on
You knock me out
You take away 
All my fears and doubts
Is this a dream you make me scream
You turn me on

You turn me on
You drive me crazy
When you whisper to me
You know I'd love to baby
Eat you up until your gone
You turn me on

I like the way that I feel when youâ€™re around
I love the way my feet donâ€™t touch the ground
Thereâ€™s something about it
I canâ€™t explain but there is no doubt
Itâ€™s something strong
You turn me on

You turn me on
You're dynamite
You light both ends of my candle
Each and every night
And when you wave your magic wand 
You turn me on

You turn me on
Like a morning breeze
When youâ€™re around me 
You put my mind at ease
Your conversationâ€™s like a song
You turn me on

I like the way that I feel when youâ€™re around
I love the way my feet donâ€™t touch the ground
Thereâ€™s something about it
I canâ€™t explain but there is no doubt
Its something strong
You turn me on

You turn me on
Youâ€™re so enlightening
When youâ€™re around me
Life doesnâ€™t seem as frightening
You are the sun you are the dawn
You turn me on

You turn me on
You bake my cake
I dream about you
When Iâ€™m wide awake
What Iâ€™m trying to say is I like the way
You turn me on
