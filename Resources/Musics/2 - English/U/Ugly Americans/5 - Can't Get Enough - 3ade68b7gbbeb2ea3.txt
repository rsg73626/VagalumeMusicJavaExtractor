CAN'T GET ENOUGH

I love my baby you know that's true
There's not a damn thing for the woman that I wouldn't do
She can't get enough
She don't know when to say when
When we get done doing it she wants to do it again

She wants her cake she wants to eat it too
She wants to do the hoochie coochie the whole night through
Looks like an angel but she's a devil in disguise
I got to run for cover when she looks in my eyes

I love my baby you know that's true
There's not a damn thing for the woman that I wouldn't do
She can't get enough
She don't know when to say when
When we get done doing it she wants to do it again

She's strong as steel she's smoother than glass
She went and broke my love bone right in half
She makes me feel much better than all right
But I just can't get enough sleep at night

I love my baby you know that's true
There's not a damn thing for the woman that I wouldn't do
She can't get enough
She don't know when to say when
When we get done doing it she wants to do it again

She's like a fire burning out of control
All she wants to do is just rock and roll
She's sweet as honey form the honey comb
But she's busy as a bee when we're all alone

I love my baby you know that's true
There's not a damn thing for the woman that I wouldn't do
She can't get enough
She don't know when to say when
