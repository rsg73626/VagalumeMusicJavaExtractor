SPACESUIT

Cincinnati apple pie
Where do we go when we die
I don't care and that ain't no lie
I don't know where and I don't know why

Everything is a part of me and part of you
Everything is a part of me and part of you
I got my spacesuit on
I got my spacesuit on
And Iâ€™m ready to fly
Away

New York city LSD
Shinning brighter than a Christmas tree
You I am supposed to be
I'm finding easier to see

Everything is a part of you and part of me
Everything is a part of you and part of me
I got my spacesuit on
I got my spacesuit on
And Iâ€™m ready to fly
Away
