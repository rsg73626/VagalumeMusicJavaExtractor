TEXAS ISN’T BIG ENOUGH

Without your love I might move to Oklahoma
Without your love I might pack my bags and go
Without your love I might as well be living in a coma
Without your love I might move to Oklahoma

Texas isn’t big enough for both of us
Without your love
It just isn’t much
Texas isn’t big enough for both of us you see
Without your love
It’s not big enough for me

Without your love I might move to New York City
Without your love I might take my chances there
Without your love the lone star state just wouldn’t seem as pretty
Without your love I might move to New York City

Texas isn’t big enough for both of us
Without your love
It just isn’t much
Texas isn’t big enough for both of us you see
Without your love
It’s not big enough for me

Without your love I might head across the border
Without your love I might I might find some comfort there
Without your love Tecate and tequila would help sort of
Without your love I might head across the border

Texas isn’t big enough for both of us
Without your love
It just isn’t much
Texas isn’t big enough for both of us you see
Without your love
It’s not big enough for me
