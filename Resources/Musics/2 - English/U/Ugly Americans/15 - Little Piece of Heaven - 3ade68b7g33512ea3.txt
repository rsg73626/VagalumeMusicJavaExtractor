LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN

Well it was nine o'clock in Memphis
There's a bottle by my side
Thought Iâ€™d take a little nip
And maybe go out for a ride
Something done come over me
And when it touched my skin
The angels opened up their wings
And let me climb on in

A little piece of heaven
Right here on earth
A little piece of heaven 
Right here on earth
And the moon shone bright
And I felt so alive
And the world was filled with love
Like a piece of heaven

Well now the wheatfields bathed in moonlight
Round the month of June
Waiting for my ship to roll in
But it never came and soon
Something done come over me
And when it touched my skin
The angels opened up their wings
And let me climb on in

Now its four in the morning
That bottle's been long gone
Waiting for the sun to come up
But I don't think Iâ€™ll make the dawn
Something done come over me
And when it touched my skin
The angels opened up their wings
And let me climb on in
