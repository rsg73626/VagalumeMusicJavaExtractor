EUREKA, I FOUND LOVE

I study the classics
That's where I'm coming from
And you got them classic lines
That make me cogito ergo sum
Well my Greek might be a little rusty
And my Latin might be dank and musty
But you don't have to be a scholar to know as I holler

Eureka, I found love
Eureka, I found love

You came and saw and conquered me
And then you went away
You left me in misery
And in an ipso facto way
Well I gave you all my sympathy
You tore 'em up just like Euripides
But now I'm back and not ashamed (if he can?) hear me saying

Eureka, I found love
Eureka, I found love
Love

<>
Marble cold and white
So why must you be such a prude
When we could cover loving (stone tonight?)
Well the ancients might have all been fags
Wearing sandals and shopping bags
And chasing after <> I'm saying

Eureka, I found love
Eureka, I found love
Eureka, I found love
Eureka, I found love
Love
