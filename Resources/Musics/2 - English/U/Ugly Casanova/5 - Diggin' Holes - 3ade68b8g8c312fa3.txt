DIGGIN' HOLES

Diggin' Holes
I wish that you would move to the sun
cause you're like diggin' holes in thin air
and we know that can't be done

i wish that you would cheat with someone
cause you're like diggin' holes in water
and we know that can't be done

bravery and stupidity go hand in hand
i guess that makes me the bravest man
i was quick to learn but slow to understand
well, what can you do

my theories are borrowed from somewhere else
and i never had too many to talk about
but you were real quick, you were quick to point out
well, that was borrowed too

i wish that you would move to the sun
cause you're like diggin' holes in thin air
and we know that can't be done

i wish that you would cheat with someone
cause you're like diggin' holes in water
and we know that can't be done

bravery and stupidity go hand in hand
and i guess that makes me the bravest man
i was quick to learn but slow to understand
well, what can you do

rhetoric and smalltalk are marching on
and i probably am the biggest pawn
cause i was quick to talk and the first to carry on
well, what can you do

you need a permit if you're gonna build shit
and you can't get one so nothing gets built
and your house is standing on a foot and a half of silt

i wish that you would move to the sun
cause you're like diggin' holes in thin air
and we know that can't be done

i wish that you would cheat with someone
cause you're like diggin' holes in water
and we know that can't be done

rhetoric and smalltalk are marching on
and i probably am the biggest pawn
cause i was quick to talk and the first to carry on
well, what can you do
