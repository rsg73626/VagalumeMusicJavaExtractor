ICE ON THE SHEETS

Committing crimes and we¹re running down the alley,
I am the captain, you¹re in the galley
With this girl she said that she was hungry
We just got done swapping our IDs
Ice on the sheets. look at the floor,
Son as I can walk I walk out the door and never stop.
Ice on the sheets look at the floor,
as soon as I can walk I walk out the door and never stop.
Im look'n at an old photograph,
it looked like we took it at gunpoint so i had to laugh.
Look at the ice, look at the floor ice on the sheets and im on the 
floor I 
never stop.

A wholeness comes and you feel a phenomenon I can¹t die, I just keep 
going 
on
Got there and a brand new ______put Œem by the bed now, bad karma 
beside 
me
Ice on the sheet a week¹s worth of pay and all the Monday
You got to where you look at your shoes and you say hey hey

Im out of breath, Im out of wits,
I'm out of these every day of the week. Oh yeah.
Committing crimes and we¹re running down the alley,
I am the captain, you¹re in the galley
With this girl she said that she was hungry
We just got done swapping our IDs

Like back in the day where everywhere was the sticks
They used to go to bars they¹d dance in lines and get sick
You dance you dance and then you¹d dance some more you,
You put on your disco shoes and dance until there were holes in the 
floor.
Back in the days when they died their hair
They still wouldn't ___________ lack of kids that cared.
Back in the days when they danced to death...
Back in the days when they banged their head...

The disco came and they did some coke.
They didn¹t have codine and the biggest joke...

And now a little red lip stick, a red bra, and a cheap cheap trick and 
that¹s me.
