DIAMONDS IN THE FACE OF EVIL

she forgot to lay the eggs
[awe shey shaw shey shaw]
penny didn't have no whistle
[awe shey shaw shey shaw]
diamonds in the horses stable
[awe shey shaw shey shaw]
the dancers didn't have their feet
on the families in the graveyard.
diggin diamonds on the face of evil.
