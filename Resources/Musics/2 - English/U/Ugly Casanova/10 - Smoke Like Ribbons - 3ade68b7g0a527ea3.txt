SMOKE LIKE RIBBONS

smoke was pulled like ribbons from the windows of the car.
i followed the flash of silver from your teeth.
above the tarmac the lights were icy green.
buried in patterns in your chest, a quiet shimmering.
little dipper, tiara-shine, song bird shivery, thin thin dime.
smoke like ribbons....
songs were pulled in ribbons from the window of the car...
lost along the shoulders of the highway.
the cake walk dancers unwind from their spin
singing 'lawty lawty loved him'.
stark don't give a flat fuck.
