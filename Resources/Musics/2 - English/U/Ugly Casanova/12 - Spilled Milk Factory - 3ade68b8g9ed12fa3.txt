SPILLED MILK FACTORY

Spilled Milk Factory
Tease your neck, kiss your spitless mouth
if you have another taste.
Carry my body, drive your rider home
if you take another bad bet.

Mumbled had a rumble and i stumbled down the stairs
Smellin' just like lumber, but my baby don't care.
We went uptown, downtown, everywhere between
There was so much spilled milk, we could've had a factory.

Silver poor house, plastic lungs, my bones,
if you take another look.
Gills of wine, slow on five,
I know when you're railing on another, baby.

Sweat basted teenagers lookin all around.
i see your babies crawlin all over the ground
they go, "goo-goo, gaa-gaa", What the hell's that mean?
I don't even know where I am, so don't go look for me.

Tease your neck, kiss your spitless mouth
if you have another taste.
Carry my body, drive your rider home
if you take another bad bet.

Things go dark, light, dark, light, day after day.
the flies weren't invited but they wouldn't go away.
The blanks were filled in filled out but never complete
there were so many dreams that there was no time to sleep.

Silver poor house, plastic lungs, my bones,
if you take another look.
Gills of wine, slow on five,
I know when you're railing on another, baby.

Not a point to make, dodged a bullet, dredged the lake,
I had one bite of wedding cake, and I about threw up.
I see bridesmaids, bridesmaids hunting for a man
One more drink and I think i'll marry him.

Tease your neck, kiss your spitless mouth
if you have another taste.
Carry my body, drive your rider home
if you take another bad bet.

Mumbled had a rumble and i stumbled down the stairs
Smellin' just like lumber, but my baby don't care.
We went uptown, downtown, everywhere between
There was so much spilled milk, we could've had a factory.

Silver poor house, plastic lungs, my bones,
if you take another look.
Gills of wine, slow on five,
I know when you're railing on another, baby
