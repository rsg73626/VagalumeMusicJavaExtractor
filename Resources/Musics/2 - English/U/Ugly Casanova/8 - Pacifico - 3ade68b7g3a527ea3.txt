PACIFICO

they said they'd give me everything,
here's the part that made me laugh.
they didn't give me anything
and then they took half of that.
Sharpen your teeth or lay flat!
you said you'd play clean, oh what a load of crap,
by the time that you were through with me
i had to take a bath
Sharpen your teeth or lay flat!
they said that it'd go good for me,
rain diamonds and all that.
i stood out in the downpour
getting hit by broken glass.
Sharpen your teeth or lay flat.
