PARASITES

the parasites are excited when you're dead
eyes bulging, entering your head.
and all your thoughts, they rot.
god and satan they gamble when you're dead
beams of light, one sprite, the other's bourbon instead
and all your thoughts, they rot.
it was hot and time was stickin to my skin.
we're all a punchline to a joke that they won't let us in on.
and all your thoughts, they rot.
