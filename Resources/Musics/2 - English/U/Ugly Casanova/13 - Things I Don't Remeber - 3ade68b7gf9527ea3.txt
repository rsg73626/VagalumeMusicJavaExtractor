THINGS I DON'T REMEBER

things i don't remember
how the hell'd we get here?
how the hell did we get here?
things i don't remeber
dressed up alligators
how the hell'd we get here?

things i don't remeber
there were dressed up alligators
there was come on the piano
disco dancin' neighbors
who were born in mashed potatoes
caught with our pants down
hidin' in the dollhouse
figured out what we're good for
you're the sailor and i'm your port
things i don't remember
we undressed for the tailor
the skin was lightly salted
opened up a can of loud mouth malted
high-fives in your eyes
push the gas and now i'm kissin' good-byes
looking for a purpose
how the hell'd we get here?

there were things i don't remember
there were messed up alligators
there we endless conversations
noone's guts were really moving
all that dust was overflowing
all my mellow-bellied temptations

things i don't remember (x21)

figured out what i'm good for making anything look better
how the hell could our neighbor?
even then i was a sailor
there were jokes that didn't land
every end was too diciple in sand

things i don't remember
there was undress for the tailor
there were jokes that couldn't land
there were disco dancin' neighbors
they were born in mashed potatoes

how the hell'd we get here?
