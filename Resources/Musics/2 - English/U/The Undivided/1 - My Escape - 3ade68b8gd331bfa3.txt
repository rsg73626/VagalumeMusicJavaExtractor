MY ESCAPE

Broken life
Pain inside
My veins only bleed cold blood
Paralyzed
In my mind
Where's my melody



Run so far let's run so far away
Time has knocked me down
Left me on the ground
Take me to our secret place

Escape


A place where I can finally breathe
I'm so caught up inside this dream
We'll escape, just you and me
Escape inside this melody



No escape from my heartaches
Please don't leave me here
I'm so far from where you are
Where's my melody?



Run so far let's run so far away
Time has knocked me down
Left me on the ground
Take me to our secret place

Escape


A place where I can finally breathe
I'm so caught up inside this dream
We'll escape, just you and me
Escape inside this melody


Take me far away
To our secret place
Lying on the stars
Right here where you are
This is ours



Finally alive...
Lost inside your eyes..
Let's escape


A place where I can finally breathe.......
I'm so caught up inside this dream........ [2x]
We'll escape, just you and me...............
Escape inside this melody......................


Finally alive...
