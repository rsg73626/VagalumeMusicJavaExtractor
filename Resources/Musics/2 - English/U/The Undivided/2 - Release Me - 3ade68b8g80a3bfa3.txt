RELEASE ME

Time is running out

I am trapped inside my own doubt

I am about to break

If I start swinging

I’ll become what I hate


I know I know I’ve got to let this go (let's go)

I’m entangled by the lies

Won’t you release me?

Time heals the wounds but can it heal my soul (heal my soul)

I’m alone without you

Won’t you please release me?


Are you listening? (Are you listening?)

Because these words appear to bounce off the ceiling

Silence leads to calloused hearts

So peel these layers off and rip my pride apart


I know I know I’ve got to let this go (let this go)

I’m entangled by the lies

Won’t you release me?

Time heals the wounds but can it heal my soul (heal my soul)

I’m alone without you

Won’t you please release me?


Take it all just take it all

Won’t you release me? [4x]


I know I know I’ve got to let's this go (let's go)

I’m entangled by the lies

Won’t you release me?

Time heals the wounds but can it heal my soul (heal my soul)

I’m alone without you

Won’t you please release me?
