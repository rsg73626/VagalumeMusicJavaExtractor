THE WRITING AND THE CRY

The oversight forgets, as the leaves upon trunk
The rain humidifies I have a meal when I cry dead calm

Home: I give melancholy
Room: of alloyed grief

Tender the silence airs soft shouts and whines
The footprints blanket ignores to feel
Alive with the sounds of the pain
I die to want to live

Solitude you insert yourself insane you rain me in the eyes
You open me the veins and I bleed internal
Another time

Home: I give melancholy
Room: of alloyed grief
