CLOSE TO YOU

Close to You, O Lord, close to You
O Lord
Close to You, in Your holy presence
Let us be vases in Your hands
To honour and adore Your precious name
Come and mould us with Your holy hands
So that Your living waters may overflow

I want more of You, I want more of You
I want more of Your holy presence
Let us go into Your holiness
Be filled with Your glory and praise
Your name
And see our hearts overflow
With Your great love, be close to You
