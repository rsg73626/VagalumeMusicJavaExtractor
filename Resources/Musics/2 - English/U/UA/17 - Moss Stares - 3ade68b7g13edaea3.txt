MOSS STARES

Run cheerfully run, you’re gonna chase it
Eye sparrow’s eye bring it
It falls into the hole again and again
A mole buries it whole to blind you

Everytime you’ve think it’s a passer-by
All the routes have so many branches
Everytime you’ve think it’s a passer-by
That’s when you gaze into your quiet

Time the longing time that you’ve waited
A hawk at night hawk is warning you
Don’t throw a stone into the pond
Moss breathes and greems, stares

Everytime you’ve think it’s a passer-by
All the ways have so many branches
Everytime you’ve think it’s a passer-by
That’s when you gaze into your quiet palm

If you wear the crown of anticipation
Touch your breath a little and let it go
