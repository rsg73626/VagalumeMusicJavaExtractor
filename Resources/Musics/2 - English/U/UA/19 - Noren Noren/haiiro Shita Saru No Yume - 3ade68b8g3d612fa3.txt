NOREN NOREN/HAIIRO SHITA SARU NO YUME

haiiro shita saru no kanashii yume wo mita yo
doushite kanashikatta no ka wa
  wakaranaku natte shimau kedo
haiiro shita saru wa itsumo totsuzen ai ni kite
dokoka de hirotta kirei na ishi wo hitotsu boku ni kureru

tokidoki ishi ga nai toki wa iroiro na
katachi wo shita happa wo takusan
genkan no mae ni narabete iku

haiiro shita saru wo eki made okutte ittara
saru no kippu wa 10(juu)en modoru kara to boku ni kureta

I had a sad dream of a monkey who
Was grey with no idea what was sad
The monkey shows up with a pretty stone
He must have found somewhere, a gift for me

When there isn't a single stone
Instead he'll show up with a batch
Of different kinds of leaves he found along the way
To be placed in front of my door
In rows so I can see them

I saw the monkey off at the station where
He handed me a single coin
A monkey's change he said it was returned
Over the station counter by the clerk

are kara ano ko wa zuibun yatte konai
AMAZON no JANGURU de tomodachi to BANANA wo
hanbun zutsu ni waketeru n' ja nai ka tte omou

haiiro shita saru no samishii yume wo mita yo
doushite samishikatta no ka wa
  wakaranaku natte shimau kedo
With no idea, what was sad wasure wa shinai
BANANA wo katte matteru yo
