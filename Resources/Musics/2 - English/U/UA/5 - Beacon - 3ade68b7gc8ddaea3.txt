BEACON

You draw a line easily with the colorless paint
It does not matter if you could not see it

The way you walk
The way you fall down

It brings me back here from a dream

The way you sing
The way you fly away

It brings me back to the place of light

You throw a torch carelessly before the dawn
It does not matter if you forget pulling it out

The way you walk
The way you fall down

It brings me back here from a dream

The way you sing
The way you fly away

It brings me back to the place of light

The beacon light turns to green in the womb
Our click begins to melt
And go and see our love

Inazuma ni
Terasarete

We walk on the sand
We look for cocoons

Michi shio ni
Odoru nami

We dive into the sea
