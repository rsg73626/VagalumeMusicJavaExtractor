THE COLOR OF EMPTY SKY

I’ve woken up at dawn soundlessly
The one inside me is floating roundedly
And I hear the murmur of the waves
Leaves wisper

The sound of the wind is born to blow
I’m feeling boundless possibilities

The one inside me is spreading through my limbs
Shadow returns to me
I open my eyes slowly again
Like a willow swings an arm

The color of empty sky has changed
The boundless possibilities I’ve touched
Turning into my own size
Then I can undress and walk
To weave with
The color of empty sky has changed
I know I’ve lost my waved wings
But countless roots have grown out of my skin
To be grounded as a tree

Stretching my arms
Leaves dry and fall
I bloom sounds watery
As a tree of the forest
Echo flows to you
A tree named fountain

The color of empty sky has changed
The boundless possibilities I’ve touched
Turning into my own size
Then I can undress and walk
To weave with
The color of empty sky has changed
I know I’ve lost my waved wings
But countless roots have grown out of my skin
To be grounded as a tree
