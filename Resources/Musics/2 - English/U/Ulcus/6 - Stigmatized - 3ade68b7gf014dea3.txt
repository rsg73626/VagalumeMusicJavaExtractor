STIGMATIZED

Burning pain in fragile flesh. A repulsive sight, an awful mess. vandalised
to the unknown. Ostracised from all around.

The image created stick to our minds. Better kept isolated to avoid
offending our sensitive eyes. Reality may hurt so we turn our heads the
other way. Leaving behind what we don't want to see. Left in the dark,
afraid to come out. Introverted by words, true evil at heart.

Deviate from the rightful way. Walk the path that lead astray. Searching for
a sanctuary. To avoid a life in the pillory. Deprived of a normal life, left
to be dehumanised. Shallow acts but deeper scar, burning pain stigmatized.

Careful search with fumble hands A desire to become entranced. Find the key
to wishes gate. To release pain, anger and hate.

Desolation works its way. In the progress one becomes what one is told to
be. Deviate from the rightful way. Walk the path that lead astray. Searching
for a sanctuary. To avoid a life in the pillory. Deprived of a normal life,
left to be dehumanised. Shallow acts but deeper scars, burning pain
stigmatized.
