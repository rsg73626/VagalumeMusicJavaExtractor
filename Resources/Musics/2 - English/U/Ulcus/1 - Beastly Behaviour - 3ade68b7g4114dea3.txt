BEASTLY BEHAVIOUR

Feel your needs and follow the lust. Obey the craving and put your trust in
the emotions that take control of all urges and blackens your soul. A
pleasure that you cant live without, pure satisfaction no room for doubt. An
ecstasy of enjoyment, where you are the master and all rules are bend.

Rising high, standing tall. Blinded by lust, unable to see the fall.

When desires are strong you might not see, how your behaviour goes against
who you are supposed to be. Temptation that lies within your blackened soul,
itches your curiosity and breaks down your control.

A beastly behaviour, a craving for flesh. Mislead by emotions no more or
less. Dark desires, skeletons unleashed. Concealed lust produces your beast.

Strength is gained by knowing your weak point. Face your fears, and live out
the urge. Release the pain and let emotions flow. A sin might be your
kingdom, only exploring will show.

Feel your needs and follow the lust. Obey the craving and put your trust, in
the emotions that take control of all urges and blackens your soul. A
pleasure that you cant live without, pure satisfaction no room for doubt. An
ecstasy of enjoyment, where you are the master and all rules are bend.
