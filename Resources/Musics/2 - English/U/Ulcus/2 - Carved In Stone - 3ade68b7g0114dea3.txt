CARVED IN STONE

Time flies by, while souls meet and drift through existence. Our lives
coalesce, through acts, touch, and intimacy. We await the future to fulfil
our hopes and expectations. But somehow we neglect what the past has
brought, to easily we forget.

The plague from ignorance will lead to the downfall of man.

Stories and mysteries from olden times, are signs of what will come. The
future is a result of the past and present, the legacy of our ancestors
carved in stone. Can't we see how its been bleeding? Can't we read the signs
from the past? Can't we see how it's all repeating? Consumed by time, what
will last?

Hear the screams of the tawny owl, a certain sign of death. Beware of the
howling wolf, roaming through night for a pray. The raven stretches its
claws, sharpened to attack. Creating a mood of fear, the dreaded
griefbringer in black. The sorcery of the night's creatures, an omen of what
will come. Lack of faith in olden wisdom, spawns the doom of our lifeform.

The plague from ignorance will lead to the downfall of man.

Respect must be earned, while learning comes through listening. By acting
what you're taught you respect what has been. Much is told, but more is
forgotten. When the tales are ignored, our legacy will rotten.
