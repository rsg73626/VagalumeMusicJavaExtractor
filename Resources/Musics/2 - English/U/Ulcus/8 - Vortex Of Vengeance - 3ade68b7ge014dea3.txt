VORTEX OF VENGEANCE

Magic flames draw me near. A beautiful sight in the dark evening. Strong
feelings embrace my heart. Filled with passion I roam through the night. How
I have yearned to inhale this moment, feel the tension that shiver my spine.
How I have longed to complete this vision, time to meet eye to eye.

Ambivalent emotions ravage my head. Thorn apart by this terrible dread. Oh I
sense your presence I feel your breath. Come closer let me smell your hair.
I lust for your erotic flesh. I wanna taste you and watch you undress. But
your flower has withered, it's rotting away. I have turned bitter, only
anger remains.

Times that have been won't be seen again. We long for the past, but our
future is dead. How I have yearned to inhale this moment, feel the tension
that shiver my spine. How I longed to complete this vision, time to meet eye
to eye.

I have screamed out pain, I have swallowed believes. I have searched my
soul, I have used my strength. But the betrayal is greater than my
forgiveness. I am caught in this vortex of vengeance. The ground is changing
colour, it's turning bloody red. Streaming down your body, oozing from your
head. Lonely I mourn, the silence is eternal. My vision has completed, as I
finish your burial.
