ROLL AROUND

The UPS man just pulled up
He dropped a package on the steps
My ticket out is in that box
Been waiting for a month
I tore it up and ripped it out
And slid on linoleum
Unattached but I'm attached
I roll around

It's hot outside it's dead inside
I'm out I'd rather melt
X-heads is killing cats
Smoked potatoes on the couch

No one's left I got in common
It's time to check out
Unattached but I'm attached
I roll around

Unattached but I'm attached 
I roll around
Unattached but I'm attached 
I roll around

Yeah I fucking roll because
My life's too fucking short
Those marathon goodbyes
One day will be for good
Break out and leave this life behind
That's my favorite song
Unattached but I'm attached
I roll around

Unattached but I'm attached 
I roll around
Unattached but I'm attached 
I roll around
