YANKS & REBS

dogfighting planes over west germany 
the red baron'll say that 
you ain't his enemy somebody's 
hit they pulled the 'chute 
and the jumped ship a prisoner 
of war now counting bricks 
i'm proud to be [x3] 
an american one two three four [x2] 
yanks & confederates 
fed up with this marched to the 
trenches in the woods of 
gettysburg the canister and shells 
they fell like rain marched onward 
to cold harbor seven thousand fell 
in half an hour the 
one's that made it home 
never seemed the sand
