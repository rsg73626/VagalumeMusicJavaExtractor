WIG OUT

Theres a brand new gig 
and its called the wig

its not for your head
its not the jig
Lossen up your pants 
and freak to the beat
take a slug of you beer 
and let it rip

If ya had a hard day, then ya better start wiggin out
ya donâ€™t have to count and it donâ€™t take a talent scout
ys donâ€™t have to measure up 
you donâ€™t need a coin for the cup
Just go for it, let it rip
Wig Out!! - exit
Nobody cares if you wanna flip
If everyone stares there just jealous
If yer home alone put your pajamas on
turn the music up and let the neighbors wig 
If you hit some one you donâ€™t have to fitght
the cops will bring yer own spot light
No tough guys need to prove 
you had a dog day afternoon
Just blow off and wig on out!
