CIRENDA

Weâ€™re all still on this earth because we all still have to learn
to love and heal each other blasphemy Iâ€™ll say the words
Yesterday rotates the same old broken tape
It falsefide my pride to hateâ€™s a soul waste

Its a shame on season
for truth to keep the lights on
Scripts are going to change
so far I see oncoming trains
a ball of wax, a can of worms 
we all point out dogs resavoir
Iâ€™m puttin down my weapon now
Iâ€™m puttin down the gun
History repeats itself surrender took so long
As my mind discards itself, the pieces left alone
I cannot redeem it all m its still some other day
Planet life is far to short to let you bother me

Itâ€™s in the drink itâ€™s in the shame 
I wonâ€™t remain, I wonâ€™t remain
The flag is up donâ€™t bring it down 
Iâ€™m gonna be Iâ€™m gonna be
Iâ€™m breakin free Iâ€™m gonna be
