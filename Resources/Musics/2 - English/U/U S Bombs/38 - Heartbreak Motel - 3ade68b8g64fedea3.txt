HEARTBREAK MOTEL

Hey you, were'd get that blues? in a juke box job down town
Say gee it's quarter to three - and she left me by the record machine
I know i'm gonna even that score - this time is for sure
Say man haven't felt this bad - since 1984
So let's dance

What ya gonna do? i don't know for sure
One thing that i know - i'm gonna dance 'til a quarter to four
We're broke on rum and coke - and i'm on heroin jones
Mushrooms and acid too - and all that speed we smoked
So take my hand and save me a dance
Give me religion come on one more chance
Take my hand save my soul
Down at the heartbreak motel
