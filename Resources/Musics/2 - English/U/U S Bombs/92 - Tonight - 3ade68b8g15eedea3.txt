TONIGHT

Close your eyes
Let's run to the city
Sleep walking holiday
Bones in the closet down
Lay in their graves
We ain't young
Tribulation, tears & sin
Poisend heads from the west end
No more spirits left four humanity

And it's cold
And it's raining
And i'm lonely
And i'm aching
And a million miles away
From you tonight

We're all wicked
Crimes of passion
Ways of the gun
Spread and plagued
By all and one
Childhood bay dreams
Stare at the sun
