DON'T GET ME WRONG

You got a ticket to my place
Short ride on the "l" train
Get off between broadway and main
I forget the name

I'm in a rocket to russia
I'm wa?hin the detectives
Listen to a record at the end of the world
Blame it on cain

Don't get belong we don't be long
I'm going to the other side, won't leave no tears behind
(all i know) don't get me wrong

I'd rather shoot the moon and miss
Aim at the gutter and make a hit
We gotta get out before they eat us off
There going soft

Riot gun'69 made a crash
Wake in the city, the gangs all clashed
Colors on black and white tv
Made a smash

Don't get me wrong
