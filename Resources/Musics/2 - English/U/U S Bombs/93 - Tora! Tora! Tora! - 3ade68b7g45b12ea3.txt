TORA! TORA! TORA!

America the beautiful amber waves of race
Constitues equality donâ€™t dub us left or right

Tora! Tora! Tora! (4x)
Freedoms just another verb that theyâ€™ve put on a roof
Analyze everything I say and take it wrong to boot.
Smash Fashion, Facism
Smash Fashion, Facism

Contradition figure it out
Critisisome!
Maybe yer just coming through
so give me all you want

Tora! Tora! Tora!
 Life and crimes and crimes of life!
Much to personal we wont get through the ground
