FRAMED

Intro: Oklahoma city bombing cover up
Timothy McVeigh is innocent
By preponderance of evidence

Lets get it straight a cover up is no accident
Evidence isolates the patsy lone assassin
Conquer and divide tactic is designed 
To refute
The fingerprint man the planted witness
Military truck in a parking lot

United States congress forced to investigate
Due to public outcry the FBI has lied
Smear campaigns CIA engaged
Routine
Camoflauge a Ryder truck
The huggers hid the other bombs
Military truck in a parking lot
Murrah Building had explosives that
Did not go off! No novelty clocks...
Dismiss the sniffing dogs
McVeigh was at McDonalds not renting trucks

A mile and a 4th down the street
Soaked in the rain dry clothes on John Doe
16 thousand tons of A.N.T.O.
The B.A.T.F. agent no elevator plummetted
Forty four days to congregate
A story to formulate
Security camera documents

McVeigh was framed
