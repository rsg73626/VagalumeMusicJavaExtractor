HAMMERED AGAIN

I woke up and fell of a root
They arrested me with a broken foot
You told the cops you didn't know who i was
A week on the city three hots and a cot

Day one i got a taste of the shakes
No sleep at all, it's past eight
Rest of the week, all seemed the same
I couldn't wait to get home again

Come on down to my place, i got a bar at my face
We both got monkeys on our backs
Come on down to my place

I got an early release on the 5th day
Dried out a lot i lost the shakes
I'll get 'em back when i get home
To the liquor store, then will start
