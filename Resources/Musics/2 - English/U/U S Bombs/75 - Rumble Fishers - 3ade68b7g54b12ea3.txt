RUMBLE FISHERS

Guitar sounds, the drums splash
our bowl is hot like a sauna
Weâ€™ve looked around the playgrounds
its sucker fish and pirahnas

Stuck in a tank Lost in Space
Tracks of the train going nowhere
We must repeat repeat after me
weâ€™re in a tank going know where

This is a stage poke me with a stick
kick me til iâ€™m dead at least verbally
yer the enemy, yer just inbetween
a living mistake Identity

the tank we swim in gets smaller
and smaller! a school of sharks
all about the dollar size in you up
size in you out ! Itâ€™s dirty pool
a School No rules weâ€™re comin up
lets get em out weâ€™re breaking out
From all the fools and threw the ranks
