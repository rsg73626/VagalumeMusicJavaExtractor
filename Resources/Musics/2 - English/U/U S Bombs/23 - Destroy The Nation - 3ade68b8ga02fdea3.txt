DESTROY THE NATION

A fucking lie! this ain't reality
A lie right down to your history
Can't even cover up their mistakes
How much more are you gonna take?

Breaking bricks and breaking rocks
All day to pay the rent
The moon is full, the sun is down
And we're running out of trends

It's up to you! Up to you!
Come one we gonna move

Recession ain't got hold on me
Employment won't get the best of me
A quarter in my pocket babe
Tonight you buy the drinks!!
Environment. Governmental corporate crunch
It ain't dumb luck, that you're getting fucked
It's up to you, it's up to you!
Come on, we gotta move

Destroy the nation, burn it down!
