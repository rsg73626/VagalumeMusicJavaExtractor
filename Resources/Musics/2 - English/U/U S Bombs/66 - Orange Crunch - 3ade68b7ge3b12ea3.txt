ORANGE CRUNCH

This bubble gives me the shakes the ozone makes this bubble bake these leather hydes, have plastic lives i've turned to stone in a city quake Tear down these walls of the crunch my lust to live is bankrupt the orange crunch is bottled up Behind the curtain there all fake this water gives me cavities this place is bland no seasonings im loitering the screws take me away (chorus) An 8 point 8 Earthquake(4x) Thats what we need
