THE CONTRACT

An old motel broad side of the road
there aint been a lick of sense the manager hides
the lable sighsthrough booking agents and promoter ties

The contracts runnin out tonight
back to the laundromats tonight
We know our place weâ€™re in your face
we are a disgrace for the human race
no hallos here, none of us are saints

the underrated, the underdogs
the unnaounced, under the fog
the boat keeps floating and we keep rowing
Fuck off weâ€™re marchin on
Weâ€™ve never been about business man 
they wonâ€™t play us on the radio
I guess weâ€™re just a bloody neusance
Weâ€™re just a bunch of fucking punks

[Chorus]
