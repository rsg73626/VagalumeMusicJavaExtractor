GOOD NIGHT

Iâ€™ll be the last to understand
while you were demoralized
God damnit times still on yer side

A rolling stone no less the 
Dischords on the side
Just add a star up in the sky

With broken records broken spirits
we broke the bar we picked
each other off the floor
we chased our shakes away 
and scared em with a drink
Always a better man that I

Thats why the saints were always marchin in
Even when their was no luck in sight
so whoâ€™s to know? whenâ€™s our time to go
so kiss yer kids and tuck em in good night
itâ€™ll be alright, its only life, I know yer
All Right its only life

Donnas guitar was your left arm
sheâ€™s on the phone stood by yer side
you did her right
picnic in the park was everyones
good night, yer in the light yer in the light
