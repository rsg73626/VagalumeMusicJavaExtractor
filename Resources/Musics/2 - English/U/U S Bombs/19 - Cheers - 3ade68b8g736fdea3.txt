CHEERS

Cheers! Cheers!

Cheers to you, cheers to me
Cheers to everything I see
Cheers to us and cheers to them
Here's to the greatest ambiance
Thanx for coming to the punk rock show
If ya don't get out, her life is bull
This is our seen away from the masses
Workin' class with a broken past

We had a good time
Good time tonight

Back in the van
Get in the van

Cheers!
