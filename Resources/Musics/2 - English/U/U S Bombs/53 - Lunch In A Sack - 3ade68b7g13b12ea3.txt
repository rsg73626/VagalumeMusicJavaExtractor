LUNCH IN A SACK

Crash, rats in a trap
Hyper me back, won't let me crash
Clean off yer T.V. screens
Wipe the film nobody seeâ€™s
eyeball that phoney smirk cuz
we;ve got to ring it out!
Crash, Iâ€™m gonna crash..... So tell me kid
to much is not enough! get em off the rack
Rocket sex and drugs to roll
its sterilized ya got fads to mold
Penelized a wild manimal
Hey! its just like they said
No money for the mind game
A vice that gripstill weâ€™re otta the way
Disect all those rejects, go ahead
and burn em all in the cage! Crash!
Iâ€™m judgin you and yer judgin me
Underneath its all gone seperates
the cause wonâ€™t die till we turn in our graves
the trap is set! Yer gonna eat the seeds
Crash! a fuckin trap, hyper me back,
to the resource back to the crap
