GUNS OF THE WEST

Billy said go get your gun
There's a revolution going on
Billy hooked up a gang of hood
To this day, youngest guns

Desperado's got nothin'
Hang up high for anything
Sioux will scalp ya, apache roulette
Bow your head and swing back

Deadwood's hot as hell, back in the day
Buffalo bill got shot in the face
Bloody death at the poker game

Guns of the west
Will never die
The desert dirt
Is where we'll lie

Round up and hang 'em high
I don't wanna die
