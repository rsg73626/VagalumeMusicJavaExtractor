BLOODY RAG

Tin soldiers fought for what we got and now its lost
Spirits of two hundred years gets laundrode in the wash
The keepers of the key have lied to you
they lied to me, millions died for a colorâ€™d cloth on a pole knee deep
Children fight so buerocrats can have a seat
Inflations up the dollars down war means economy
Heâ€™s digging for the gold he wears a flag upon his sleeve
bible in his hand
Lavish the oil in the middle east
Ousted Ousted Ousted Ousted

ya donâ€™t believe ya donâ€™t
its dungary its dungary to talk
ya donâ€™t believe its dungary - ect
Bloody rag torn to shreds
Bloody rag millions dead
Bloody rag !
A bloody rag
