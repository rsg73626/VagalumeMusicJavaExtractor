IN & OUT

downtown hangin around
over and under in and out
stanger now in a different town

My babe so far away
she at the top of the world
im way down here
way down under with the kangaroos
right down im at the pleasure chest
usin my mind i take me there
no landing pad for the asto-plane
i got the in and out

take of and run
take of and roll
take of and run
take off and go

downtown hangin around
over and under in and out
stanger now in a different town

We got the in and out

take off the runway
take off and go
take off the runway
take off and go

take off and run
take off and go
take off and run
take off and go

(downtown) Take off the runway (hangin'around)
Take off and go
(downtown) Take off the runway (hangin'around)
Take off and go
(downtown) Take off the runway (hangin'around)
Take off and go (over and under in and out)
Take off the runway (stranger now in a different town)
Take off and go (over and under in and out)

downtown hangin around
over and under in and out
stanger now in a different town
over and under in and out
