CROATIA BREAKS

I live a third world life
My people starve in poverty
It's really nice to see a
Band mean what they say
I know your freedom's limited
You've seen how it is for me
Few that come through isn't often
We just want to leave

The propaganda's horrible
The fascist president
He cleaned out the hospital
Of cancer patients
He took out the whole fifth floor
He's done it twice before
There isn't any law for him
Dictator has us chained

Croatia breaks
Croatia breaks

A matter of the factories
The workers don't get paid
For when we do it's spoiled food
We share with family
For if we question authority
One day we disappear
We just take the breaks
And dream escape and heading west

Croatia breaks
Croatia breaks
