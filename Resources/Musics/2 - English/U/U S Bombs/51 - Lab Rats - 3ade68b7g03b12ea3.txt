LAB RATS

God bless the police invisible marines
Your state isn't safe and niether is me
We're the rats of experiment
Suburban laboratore
We're the mice without legs
Tagged at birth

Laboratory rats
This is a lab

The scientist he's your god
The scientist till we're gone

The science fair's continual
Aliens are having fun
They let us go a bit in
Our own time zone

Science bless computer chips
God bless your families
Science bless your little pets
It's time to come clean
