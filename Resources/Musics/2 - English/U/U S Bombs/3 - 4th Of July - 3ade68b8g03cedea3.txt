4TH OF JULY

You got the pledge of allegiance
And you are jesus christ
Epitome of intelligence
And all the meathead are gonna fight

You are the dream weavers and
You are the flames who keeps
After the apocalypse
Before the beast

On the fourth of july

They got their hands in your pocket
They got rockets in the sky
Looks like it's bloody sunday
State corrupt indirect lies

On the fourth of july
Ain't nobody free
