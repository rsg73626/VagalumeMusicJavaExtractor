LOCKED IN MY SKIN

Locked in my skin
Know relax is, in my skin
No substance, all alone is fucking rough
This body's hard to all around with nothing in my skin
It's twice as hard once I put something
It's only entertainment
Till we get to the next gig
It's way too hard to live locked in my skin

Locked in my skin
I can't sit around and read a book
The pages always shaking way too much
Locked in my skin, it's a prison
From within
There ain't no escape except getting
Stop the entertainment 'til
We get to the next stop
It's way to hard to live
Locked in my skin

Locked in my skin
