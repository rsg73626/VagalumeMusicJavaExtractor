REVOLUTION WEEKEND

It's automatic, it's automatic
You're livin' on the streets
Lost your job to a robot
And you gave up to drink'

Talking and babbling
Are two different things
The hell you gonna lose anyway
Take back the u.s.a

Whose side are you really on?
A closet suits as bad as a cop
Who moonlights as punk

Revolution weekend
Weekend revolution, now my friend
Storm the u.s. embassy
Ship the suits to the army
Drag your leader through the street
They're killing us anyways

Fuck your revolution!
