ISOLATED ONES

Can't buy you cadillac a diamond ring there's no dough in the ghetto a nine to nine got a barmy life and i broke all thw windows we are the isolated ones we're gonna run run run get my loaded gun bel air mannequin's too good for me it walked by as if i was a bum kicking my can across the dirty street to my mansion at the dump we're your minority in the city financial district we ain't blessed i just seen a suit jump off a building i guess the stocks in the market crashed the solid waste here bulks in plenty of theives and plenty of greed nothing to eat but a can of beans and i'm stuck with l.s.e. projects road rage car jacks looting shoulders of the world a no life gangfight parasite shooting shoulders of the world
