WE ARE THE PROBLEM

Don't believe in anything they say
The day after yesterday is all it takes
No good hands in all state
A city a country it's all the same
The less you have to say this band's name, the better

Bomb city rocker from out of nowhere
Not a chance to be saved
A lot of wood to carry the cross
A band without a country

We're no solution, We're the problem

Families on the left, pray and beg for work
Families on the right, slow mission suicide
We're going to a pirate grave
Band without a country
The damage has been done
And damage control is way too late
