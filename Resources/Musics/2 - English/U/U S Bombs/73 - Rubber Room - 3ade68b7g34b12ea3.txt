RUBBER ROOM

Yer goin to the rave
Yer goin to the rave
Ya wanna get laid gonna paint yer face

Goin to the disco
Goin to the disco
Man with the camel toe dancin to the techno

Goin to the rockshow
Goin to the rockshow
There hoseâ€™n off the pigs the devils in the backrow.

Iâ€™m a little mental Iâ€™m a little mental
Iâ€™m a gonna pogo through the glass window
the fog machine and the extasy in your mouth.....

it aint sexy its just fuckin foul

Lobotomies and all the loonies
come on lets get 'em now
We gatta storm this mental ward,
walk with our heads held proud
Zombies donâ€™t and dead men walk,
standing all around
nobody feels theyâ€™ve got no pulse,
we dance at the speed of sound
Get off your asses get off the mattress now

Go on back to the rubber room proud
ya gotta get back to the rubber room
