YOUTH GOES!

street survives a cocky kid
suburban casualty
care free young and dont fit in
abbrasive around old sensitives
targets himself
cannon fodder remenates
he slowly blows away
walk thru it all and dont look back
you get a blast! youth goes!

the danger zone is soft to him
they dont understand
there on the sidelines pulling at you
dont listen to them
they want you to toss it in the can
dont give it up to be an old man
then theirs a blast! youth goes!
youth goes!
theres a blast! youth goes on!
