DO IT AGAIN

Well ya left me dead and ya didn't wanna be my friend - yeah, yeah do it again
Rolled me over went threw my pocket and ran - hey hey do it again
Goin' back home but i have no home to go - no, no do it again
Shootin' for the moon in a cannon face first on the floor - yeah, yeah do it again
If hurt so bad, i just wanna die and leave life in the past
She broke my heart when she sold my best guitar - yeah, yeah do it again
Sinkin' in the hour glass time is so slow - hey, hey do it again
Turnin'up the heart but i'm back out in the cold - no, no, do it again
Shootin' for the moon but i'm swingin' on a star - yeah, yeah, do it again
If hurt so bad just wanna die and leave life in past
