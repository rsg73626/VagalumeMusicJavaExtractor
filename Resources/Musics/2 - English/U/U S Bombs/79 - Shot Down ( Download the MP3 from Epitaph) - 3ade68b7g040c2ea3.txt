SHOT DOWN ( DOWNLOAD THE MP3 FROM EPITAPH)

I got a pistol and I'm gonna use it
One shot two shot down
I got marshal law is in my hand
One shot two shot down
Two motherfuckers are gonna die
You went behind my back for what was mine
One shot two shot down
The guilt was dripping down her legs
One shot two shot down
Are you gonna die for a dead lay
One shot two shot down
A smelly cunt you pathetic prick
A fair for the carnival
Two midgets are fucking slime
One shot two shot down
Your face is gone they're blown off
One shot two shot down

Bodies laying in the mud
I just shot you down
You cheat on me you make me mad
I just shot you down
Gave you both all my love
I just shot you down 
Now your dead in public
I just shot you down
