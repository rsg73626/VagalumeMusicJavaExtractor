DIE ALONE

Walked all around through London Town
Hung awhile on carnaby 
What happened to the Soho
What happened to Kings Road
A revolution blitze
Completely smashed to bits
of kids, what about the future
I thought that there was none
Die Alone!
A queens jubilee, the kings gettin change
and Malcomb gets arrrested for publicity
So let it rock and let it sex
the fetish in the punk rock is left fo dead

At each others throat they couldnâ€™t trust themselves
no ones taking notes
Tell it like it was
Someone takes a stab and no one makes a stand
Living in the flaws of an imperfect world
a fight for freedom freedom lost
We die alone
Remember the cause
We die alone, so die with a cause
We die alone, a calling of the punks
We die alone, because I still trust no one.
