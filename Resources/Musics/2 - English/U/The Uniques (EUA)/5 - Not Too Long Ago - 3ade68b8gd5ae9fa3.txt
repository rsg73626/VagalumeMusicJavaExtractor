NOT TOO LONG AGO

She used to hold me close
at the picture show,
that was when she really, really loved me so,
then he came along
like the stormy sea,
not to long ago,
now she don't love me anymore.                                     

She used to walk with me
beneath the tall oak tree,
she had me thinkin'
how happy we would be
and then he came along
like the devil in disguise
not too long ago,
now I've got tears in my eyes.

She said she'd always be my girl,
she said her love would never die,
she said she'd always be my girl,
then she left with him
left my heart to cry,

Now I'm so lonely,
broken and blue,
because I don't have no one
that I can talk to,
'cause he took her away from me
not too long ago.
Now she don't love me anymore.

She said she'd always be my girl,
she said her love would never die,
she said she'd always be my girl,
then she left with him
left my heart to cry.

Now I'm so lonely,
broken and blue
because I don't have no one
that I can talk to,
'cause he took her away from me
not too long ago.
Now she don't love me anymore.
