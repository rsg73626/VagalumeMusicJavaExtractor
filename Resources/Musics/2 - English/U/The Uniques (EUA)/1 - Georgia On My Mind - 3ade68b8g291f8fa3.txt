GEORGIA ON MY MIND

Oh! I say Georgia
Oh! Georgia...
Wanna my whole life through
Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia, on my mind 
Oh! I'll Keep Georgia, on my mind
 I said Georgia!
Oh! Georgia...
Why not no peace I find?
Just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia, on my mind

Other eyes smile tenderly
Other arms reach out to me
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Other eyes smile tenderly
Other arms reach out to me
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Oh! I said Georgia!
Oh! Georgia...
Wanna my whole life through
Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia, on my mind 
Oh! yeah, yeah, yeah...
