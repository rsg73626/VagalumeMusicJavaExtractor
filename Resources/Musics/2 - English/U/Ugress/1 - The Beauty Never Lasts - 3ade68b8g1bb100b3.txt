THE BEAUTY NEVER LASTS

Be quiet still live this moment
Smoke in my eyes
Smoke in your eyes
Lovely speeches
Lovely in my dress
You where there
You where there

Kind of holy
Remember you holding me
Trembling yes
The beauty never lasts with me
Cause beauty never last you see

And all the things I'm glad I had but
Oh so sad to have
The things I left to stay with you
I should have kept a thing or two

Being a woman
Being a man
Being a woman
Being a man

Be quiet dive in the moment
Blue faced disguise
Searching her eyes
Fighting like a
Night on a clear day
Floating away fading away

Found a spark in the shade from a shark
But mystery afterlife
Then you will have a dance with me
And we will have a laugh you see

A spinning wheel
The lines for reel
The taste of a closed deal
And how to punish vanity
And how we polish sanity

Being a woman
Being a man
Being a woman
Being a man
