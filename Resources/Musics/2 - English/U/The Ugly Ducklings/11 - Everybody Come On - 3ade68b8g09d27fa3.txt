EVERYBODY COME ON

Na Na Na Na Na
Scratch: 1,2,3,4

Years ago we took freestyle raps
Got two turn table and we started from scratch
Now everytime that we go do a spot, they
say,"Yo, Ugly Duckling you
rock"
So weather you're in short ot a tux with a cumerbun
movin' like soul brother number one
Young Einstein breaks the sticks
And I could start with an EQ and good mic mix
'Cause it's the microphone I love, I hold her
close with a tug
And give her a snug hug before I plug in the plug
Unrap her before I tap her to get her some feedback
And it's on so we rap, C'mon

Na Na Na Na Na
All the ladies in the place
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
And all the fellas in th place
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
And all the ladies in the place
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
And all the fellas in the place
[Singing]

"i" double "z" "y" I could begin
When they get the levels set to let my DJ spin
I release what's within feel free to join in
Dizzy is my name but I'mma me spell it again
D-devistate, I-impress, Z-zeftfully clean and fresh,
another Z for the zip code that I got on the north
side of town, and Y? Why not?
I got the flux capacitator for my Model T Ford
With lots of Giga watts to go back to before
The items on the floor at your novelty store,
need I say more?

Einstein, break it down like this
Scratch: Sound effect
Einstein, dooin' his do
Young ladies from near or far, weather
you're high class or rather bourgoise

Get down, as ugly duckling unlocks the box like
pandora
If you're comin' to the jam ignore the group on stage
yellin' louder than banshees
Actin' ready for war like some Comanches
And they call themselves hip-hop men
Where have you been?
You're messin' up now 'cause you didn't know it then
And what do we call a crew that can rap like that...
Wack!
They got a wacky wack style and a wacky wack track
there would be more room if those cats played the back
Starting from when the line is long
until the line is gone, everybody C'mon

Na Na Na Na Na
All the ladies in the place
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
And all the fellas in th place
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
And all the ladies in the place
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
And everybody C'mon
[Singing]
Young lady
Bang!
