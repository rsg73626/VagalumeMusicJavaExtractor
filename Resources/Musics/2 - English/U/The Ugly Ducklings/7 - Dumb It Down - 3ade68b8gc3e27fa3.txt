DUMB IT DOWN

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

[Andy C]
Here we go now, keep it low-brow
Get stupid (Why?) Cause I know how
Check my brain in, be a idiot
Act lame and stay ignorant
Be remedial, wear the dunce cap
Slouch over and drool like a hunchback
Don't discuss things, shout the last word
Put your good sense out to pasture
Drop your IQ, that's what I do
My advice to girls and guys who
Wanna be a Nobel Prize finalist
Smack the scientist, try apply in this
Keep the customers comin around
If you're smart then you better start dumbin it down
Don't say anything too profound
Dumb - it - down

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
I wanna hear ya
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Everybody
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

[Dizzy Dustin]
What are you thinkin? I don't know
Do you have a dream? I don't know
What about tomorrow? I don't know
What does this mean? Hm?
Please no questions, no topics
Save the message and the logic
Take it easy, keep it lightweight
You're on thin ice and I might break
Call me blockhead or an animal
While I walk like a Neanderthal
Don't say anything too profound
Dumb - it - down

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
I wanna hear ya
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Come on now
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Everbody
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

[Andy C & Dizzy Dustin]
Why be clever? It would be better
To sit and talk about the weather, right?
At work or the schoolyard, don't think too hard
(Why?) I read this off a cue card
Take a good thing, run it into the ground
If you're smart, then you better start dumbin it down
Don't say anything too profound
Dumb - it - down

(I don't know what it is, man)
