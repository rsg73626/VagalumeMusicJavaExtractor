EINSTEIN'S TAKIN' OFF

[ANDYCAT:] When young
[DIZZY:] Einstein
[ANDYCAT:] Was a kid
[DIZZY:] With a bid
[ANDYCAT:] He had some 1200's inside his crib
[DIZZY:] And an MPC, under his sheets
[ANDYCAT:] To make beats, accomplishing incredible feats
[DIZZY:] While other kids played games like Chinese checkers
[ANDYCAT:] Rod pounded the pavement to find these records he used
[DIZZY:] He makes hits with the flick of a wrist
[ANDYCAT:] Einstein's taking off
[DIZZY:] Let me put it like this
There's not a Benadryl pill that could stop the itch
Or a scratch when my DJ gets up in the mix
He grips the cross fader with his nimble fingertips
And flips it back and forth, no transform switch
[ANDYCAT:] And the needle never skips?
[DIZZY:] Well it did one time,
When a fan got hype and bumped the tables from behind
[EINSTEIN:] So please give me some room when I'm going for mine
[DIZZY:] Einstein's taking off
[ANDYCAT:] Take off Einstein

[HOOK: Young Einstein on the turntables]
When it gets to the end, tell him do it again!.....
When it gets to the end, tell him do it again!....
Young Einstein....don't try to play me.....
I like to make funky beats and record 'em....
The scratch....th-th-the scratch...
We'll be on top....so long!...
Young Einstein....don't try to play me.....
I like to make funky beats and record 'em....
The scratch....th-th-the scratch...
I got two great partners standing by me....


[ANDYCAT:] Take the freeway from Canada to TJ
And I know that you won't find another DJ
[DIZZY:] Slash
[ANDYCAT:] Super record digger
[DIZZY:] Slash
[ANDYCAT:] Drum major
[DIZZY:] Slash
[ANDYCAT:] Producer
[DIZZY:] Slash
[ANDYCAT:]
Ugly Duckling making a splash
He lifts loops from the original LP's
Would never think of sampling a beat break CD
And when we come to do your show, turn off the DAT's
Save 'em for those other acts, Einstein's got the wax
For the turntables, he'll reverse it, scratch,
Cut it in half......and reattach it
And keep it spinning from the beginning to the duration
when (Young Einstein) is in (deep concentration)
Yo Diz!
[DIZZY:] Wassup?
[ANDYCAT:] We almost didn't tell 'em
How Rod explores record stores like he was Magellan
[DIZZY:] Searching for the beats only he can find
[ANDYCAT:] Einstein's taking off
[DIZZY:] Take off Einstein
