SMILING FACES SOMETIMES

Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof
Oh, Lord yeah

Let me you tell you
The truth is in the eyes 'cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember, a smile is just a frown turned upside down
My friend

So hear me when I'm sayin'
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes they
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof

Beware, beware of the handshake that hides the snake
I'm tellin' you beware, beware of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back, jealousy, misery, envy

I tell you, you can't see behind smiling faces
Smiling faces, sometimes they, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof

Your enemy won't do you no harm
'cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice, I'm only tryin' to school ya

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
