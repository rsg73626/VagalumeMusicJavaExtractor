MURDERED BY A BIG BOMB

I know what I realized Kenneth when I'd seen her car hit the side of a tree 
I knew 
I know what I saw there, lying on the sidewalk 
The things we couldn't change 
Murdered by a big bomb 
Dropped right in the center of 
Our city and in our time 
I know we probably shouldn't do this Sara, but then regrets are the only thing that I remember anyhow 
Straighten up our lives there's no time left to spare 
And if it's all the same to you, well then it's all the same to me I guess
And if it's all the same, it's all the same, and that's alright with me guess so
Murdered by a big bomb 
Dropped right in the center of 
Our city and in our time 
I know your face 
I see it everyday 
I hear your name 
When no one is around 
I remember this 
The Way You Used To Smile.
