IN HER ARMS

Don't give your eyes away 
Don't give your heart away 
Don't give your lies away 
Your doing fine 
I listen 
The radio 
Vote night! Vote night! 
Is the ghost of Ronald Regan in her arms? In her arms!

I tried religion it just seemed too vague
I tried to love but it just seemed too strange 
I looked down from an airplane on the city 
Then I panicked with all these thoughts just shaking through my skull 
You'll be in my arms tonight 
You stay here while these ghosts just haunt me 
I tried religion it just seemed too vague 
I tried to love but it just seemed too strange 
I looked down from an airplane on the city 
But I panicked with all these thoughts just shaking through my skull 
You'll be in my arms tonight 
You stay here while these ghosts just haunt me 
Ghosts just haunt me 
 You stay here and these ghosts won't haunt me.
