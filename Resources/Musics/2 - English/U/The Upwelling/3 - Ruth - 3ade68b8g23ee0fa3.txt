RUTH

Life is full of accidents my Ruth for me to drag down to the well 
I buried so much for you Ruth, that we are both going to hell 
But when you burst like a balloon 
I was the one that you came to 
But now there is nothing I can do 
No I can't help you 
Ruth 
What did you do? 
I helped you burn the money Ruth 
I stuck the needle in you too 
I hid it from your neighbors Ruth 
But now there is nothing I can do 
And when I think about my youth 
I end up thinking about you 
And how the world is fucking cruel 
But I can't help you 
Ruth 
What did you do? 
No I can't help you 
Ruth 
What did you do? 
No I can't help you.
