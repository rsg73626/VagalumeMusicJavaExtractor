WAS A LOVE OF SUMMER

morning of sunshine, beaches, and you there in March 
I looked into the sky I saw your face and fall of love 
until ai, did not believe in love at first sight 

Refrão:
I did not know that the people would be found 
but it was unforgettable, it was much more than a passion 
was a love of summer 

I want to run away with you 
I want to stay with you for ever

Refrão:
I did not know that the people would be found 
but it was unforgettable, it was much more than a passion 
was a love of summer
