THESE DAYS

These days came faster than anyone could know
These days keep getting harder, why did you have to go?
'Cause underneath this face, these are much darker days

You woke up in another world,
I never would have dreamed of this
You showed me how to live each day
The only thing i want to say is
Goodbye, Goodbye

These days are brighter now that I understand
Your life had purpose, It made me who I am
Never without faith, You gave unending grace

You woke up in another world,
I never would have dreamed of this
You showed me how to live each day
The only thing i want to say is
Goodbye, Goodbye

How could you have ever known
You'd leave me here all alone
With all you made and all you saved
The only thing I want to say is Goodbye, Goodbye

You woke up in another world,
I never would have dreamed of this
You showed me how to live each day
The only thing i want to say is
Goodbye, Goodbye
