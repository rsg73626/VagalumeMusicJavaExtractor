ALMOST ALIVE

The troubles we make
Our biggest mistakes
Questions that we cannot escape

It won't be long until they are gone
Just find a way to hold on

Cheer up
We're almost alive
Wipe the tear from your eye
It's alright

Don't give up
The end is in site
There's more than this life
We're almost alive

Don't spend your days
Lost in a sway
With questions that we cannot face

Don't run away, don't be afraid
Lonely will someday go away

Cheer up
We're almost alive
Wipe the tear from your eye
It's alright

Don't give up
The end is in site
There's more than this life
We're almost alive

And all that we've been
Will come to an end
These lonely days will fade away

The feelings we hide
Will all come to life
And we will finally be alive

Cheer up
We're almost alive
Wipe the tear from your eye
It's alright

Don't give up
The end is in site
There's more than this life
We're almost alive
