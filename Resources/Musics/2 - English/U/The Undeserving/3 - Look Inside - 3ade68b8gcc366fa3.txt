LOOK INSIDE

(Verse 1)
I don't understand why I feel lost inside myself. I don't know why I'm here or who I should be.
What do you see in me?

(Chorus)
Look inside my heart. Please tell me who I am.
Won't you show me where to start so I can understand?

Look inside my heart. In You there is no shame.
It's tearing me apart when I don't know my name.

(Verse 2)
Is there more to me? I want to find out what's beneath.
Can I be everything you ever ask for?
Please tell me what you see.

Bridge 
You take it all away - the fears I cannot say
And when I understand I begin to see
You give your name to me
