SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR

Verse 1
Do you remember when life was an ember waiting to burst into flames? Are you so tired and so uninspired, slowly drifting to the end?

Pre-Chorus
Don't let your heart keep breaking.
Move on. Please don't look back.

Chorus
We fall down. We get up. We try to hold our head up when life pulls us apart. We fight and we bleed but all we ever need is something to hope for, something to hope for.

Verse 2
Whatever we can see, whoever we should be is well within our reach. Though nothing is certain we pull back the curtain longing for purpose there.

Pre-Chorus
Don't let your heart keep breaking.
Move on. Please don't look back.

Chorus
We fall down. We get up. We try to hold our head up when life pulls us apart. We fight and we bleed but all we ever need is something to hope for, something to hope for.

Bridge
We bend, we may break, but we keep it together. We give and we take but we keep trying. 

Chorus
We fall down. We get up. We try to hold our head up when life pulls us apart. We fight and we bleed but all we ever need is something to hope for, something to hope for,
