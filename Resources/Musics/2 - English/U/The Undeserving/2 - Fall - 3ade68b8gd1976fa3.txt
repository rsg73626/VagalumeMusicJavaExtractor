FALL

Nothing you can do, will ever get you through
You've lost hope, you can't cope, you'll find hope right here

Fall into my arms tonight

What else can I do? I'm always here for you
I will love you, I will hold you, can you see me here?

Fall into my arms tonight
I will make everything all right.
Fall into my arms tonight
You will never be let down again


I know you suffered and lost everything I gave to you
Lay down your burdens, fall into my arms

Fall into my arms tonight
I will make everything all right.
Fall into my arms tonight
