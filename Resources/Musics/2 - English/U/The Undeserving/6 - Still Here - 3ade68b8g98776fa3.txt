STILL HERE

She looks out the window
Watches the wind blow
Wondering where it goes
Her whole life's here, every dream and every fear
But will she ever know?

That I heard her footsteps in the hall
Heard her head against the wall
Saw her dreams they took a fall,
Is there any hope at all?

So take a little time and wonder why your life is still stuck here
Time will pass you by so you should try to figure out why you're still here

She picks herself up off the floor
Wishing life had so much more
Thinks she's got nowhere to go
But there's a mom who cares
and a dad who's always there
and friends who let her know

That life is a little more than wine, or a brand new valentine
or money you can blow, at least you have somewhere to go

So take a little time and wonder why your life is still stuck here
Time will pass you by so you should try and figure out why you're still here

You try to look away, but you can't escape it
so what are you gonna do? It's all up to you

So take a little time and wonder why your life is still stuck here
Time will pass you by so you should try and figure out why you're still here
Why are you still here?
