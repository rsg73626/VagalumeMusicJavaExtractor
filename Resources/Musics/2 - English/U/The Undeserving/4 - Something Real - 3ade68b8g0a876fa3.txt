SOMETHING REAL

Somewhere along the way I forgot my place
Trusting my own voice, finding my own way

You found me far away searching everywhere
Following a lie, I tried to find You there

My mind strays a million miles away
But my heart still cries for home
You are my strength when I feel alone
My search for something real ends with You

I just can't afford hopelessness or fear
Running from it all led me nowhere near

You have given all You have for me
You are what love should be

My mind strays a million miles away
But my heart still cries for home
You are my strength when I feel alone
My search for something real ends with You
