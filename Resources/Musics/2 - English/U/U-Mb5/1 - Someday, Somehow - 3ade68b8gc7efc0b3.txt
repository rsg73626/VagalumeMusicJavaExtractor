SOMEDAY, SOMEHOW

I walk in through that door
My mind is marching in
But nothing quite explains

Why you
I'm falling out of view

And do you feel the pain?
This pain I felt in you
As if I always knew
The words
I'd never say to you somehow
These words that would mean nothing

It's alright
It's alright
We're running out of things
To say
We've got the answer

It's alright
It's alright
Oh, please dont say you're sorry
I know
And it will all be fine
Someday

I'll gladly take the blame
For all we've ever had
I'll take these broken things
And I'll try to mend the cracks

It's alright
It's alright
We're running out of things
To say
We've got the answer

It's alright
It's alright
Oh, please dont say you're sorry
I know
And it will all be fine
Someday

And everything I do
I did it all for you
But it's all over
Yes It's all over

It's alright
It's alright
We're running out of things
To say
We've got the answer

It's alright
It's alright
Oh, please dont say I'm sorry
I know
And it will all be fine
Somehow
