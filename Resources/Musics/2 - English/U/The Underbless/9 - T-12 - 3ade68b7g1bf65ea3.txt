T-12

Screaming for the moon (But not hear answer),
Searching the what losted (But not find'it),
Between the day and night (You're being a loser),
Waiting the day what you'll crush them (You are so blind);

Seeing the stars in a dark night,
He has fight for us,
He has winned the time,
And waiting for our answer he lost him life;

The life is beatiful (We that spoil with it),
The cry is a divine bless (We cry for nothing),
Tears take a little of our soul (You cried so much),
Games will be currupt we (Beware the dog is free),

Seeing the stars in a dark night,
He has fight for us,
He has winned the time,
And waiting for our answer He lost him life;

You try walk away of the right way (Why do you do it?),
Fighting against pain of your hearth (What you recive for?),
Waiting die because you don’t forguet it (What you'll do now?),
You want to die but this is not the solution (Do you understand now?),

Seeing the stars in a dark night,
He has fight for us,
He has winned the time,
And waiting for our answer He lost him life;

Do you know of who I’m speaking about? 
Do you know of who I’m speaking about?
Do you know of who I’m speaking about?
Do you know of who I’m speaking about?

Seeing the stars in a dark night,
He has fight for us,
He has winned the time,
And waiting for our answer He lost him life;

But He’s alive, He’s alive, He’s alive.
