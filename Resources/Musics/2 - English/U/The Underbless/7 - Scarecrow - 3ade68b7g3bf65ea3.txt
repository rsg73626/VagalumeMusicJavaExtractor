SCARECROW

I, in my selfishness, lie to my self to belive in my mind,
My freedom become a new dream,
Don't cry anymore, someday somehow,
I'll find my mind again,
But I need to fight against my fears,
I need to free my hands, from this burdens,

And walk among the gardens of flowers crusheds,
And find my way among the fields of the loneyness,

I, in my hope, leave the dark of shadows,
My eyes are opened for to the truth,
Don't leave me alone, sometimes I know, that is hard,
But I need to let tears down,
I need to free my own, from this mind blind,

And walk among the strangers and love anyone,
And find my face in mirror, and belive in what I saw,

I walk alone, trying find my mind,
Trying find my way, in footsteps of who walked his way,
Need I fall one more time,
Need I run every my life,
From my own, from everything what I were?

I need walk among the roses,
I need open my heart,
I need to feel all my life free,

And walk among the strangers and love anyone,
And find my face in mirror, and belive in what I saw.
