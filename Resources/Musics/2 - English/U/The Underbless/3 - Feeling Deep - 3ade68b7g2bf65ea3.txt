FEELING DEEP

Sometimes in the conners of my mind, I feel loneyness,
Something is a link of my presente what take to my past,
In the calmness of my heart, in the raim storm,
The untitled chaos that we named fear, conquer my peace,

Lighting everything, is clear now, when your opened my eyes,
I were away, so I belive now, in this feeling deep,

Cryn' tears in a river, cleaning all things what it touch,
Passing by dreamer, who belive that can be a king,
Taking all the dreams of a king,
The days what passed don't back anymore,

Lighting everything, is clear now, when your opened my eyes,
I were away, so I belive now, in this feeling deep,

Feeling deep, feeling deep, feeling deep,

Lighting everything, is clear now, when your opened my eyes,
I were away, so I belive now, in this feeling deep, feeling deep.
