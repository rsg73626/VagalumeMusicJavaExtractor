DIM LIGHT

With my inner self full of arrogance
I disdain my future in the summit of the mountain
Amid the coldest solitude
I have learned to die, I have learned to die
To die in the deepest sense
The fear of the end is the source of all want of hate
And that fear is born just when hate itself begins to vanish.
I replaced the dim light of day
By the shining of the nameless, profane night.
I have learned to die, I have learned to die
To die in the deepest sense
The fear of the end is the source of all want of hate
And that fear is born just when hate itself begins to vanish
