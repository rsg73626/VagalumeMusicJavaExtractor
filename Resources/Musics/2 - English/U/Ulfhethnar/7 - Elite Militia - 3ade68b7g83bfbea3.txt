ELITE MILITIA

In search of a force to gain the power to dominate
I just can find around weak slaves of vice
Which humiliate and prostitute their pride
Miserable beings just worthy a crown of thorns.
I just think of destroying them
To let them burn in frost
I just think of destroying them
To let them burn in frost.
I shall purify the blood, I shall cleanse my land
Sin search of a pure mind and a pure strength
To ennoble the militia and to exterminate the mediocre scum
For the return of the ancient hierarchies.
