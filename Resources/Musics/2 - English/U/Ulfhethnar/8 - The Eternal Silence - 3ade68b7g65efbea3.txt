THE ETERNAL SILENCE

Sixth fullmoon nigth
The entrails of sacred forest
Ritual, hunger for might domination
Wisdom and silence eternally
Concealed and hermetic power
A cold central space
The eternal Silence
When the sun never shine
Reaplaced by stream of blood
Welling from unholy oaks
A cold of fountein
In ceremony of life and death
In a covenant for fury of war
In a covenant for the fury of numen
The eternal silence
