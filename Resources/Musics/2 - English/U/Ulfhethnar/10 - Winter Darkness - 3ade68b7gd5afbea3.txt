WINTER DARKNESS

Winter darkness
Fierce care of the wolves pack
Beholding the human movements
In silence and expectation bursting in attack
To dear christian limbs
To spill poisoned blood
Do howl in victory
The full moon is above
Hunting night for us
Nourishment to our hate
And the our instincts cruel
Freezing the night
Is the eternal symbol of our resistance
Against that which is not immortal
Against that which is to be wasted away
Night of the earth
A perfect lair to the wolves of death
Examples of unparalleled fierceness
In a bloody war
Against christianity
That stinking sickness
Which profanes our dark natured lands
