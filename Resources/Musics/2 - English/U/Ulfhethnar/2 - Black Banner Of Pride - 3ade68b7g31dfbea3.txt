BLACK BANNER OF PRIDE

Where summits collide and streams turn to ice
Where night drips damp blood and thick clouds wage war
Where lands are aghast and shades spread afar
There we erect our black banner of pride.
Where soil is too low and mist covers all
Where foul corpses pile and life turns to dust
Where mankind is scum and pestilence reigns
There we still fight under our banner of pride.
Where a base stinking race holds the reins of all ours
Where weak dogmas stretch their domes to the skies
And vile social thoughts trample hierarchies down
There war shall wield our black banner of pride.
Battle for those of us who are still proud men
Triumph for those who hold the black standard high
