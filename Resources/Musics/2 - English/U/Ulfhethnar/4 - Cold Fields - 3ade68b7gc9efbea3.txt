COLD FIELDS

One more night here, alone and immaculate
Maybe one more night like others nights
I'm still alive
I am in this dark and cold field
Going through storms and loneliness
Somewhere in these forests he will be waiting for me
One more night here
Maybe one more night
Going through his anger with my lament
You become to me a great warrior
I am a great faithful about your words
The cold whip is punishing hardly in these shadows
And I am still alive, I'm following your steps
I'm that dark and cold field
Going through torms and loneliness
Somewhere in these forests he will be waiting for me
One more night here
Maybe one more night
Going through his anger with my lament
