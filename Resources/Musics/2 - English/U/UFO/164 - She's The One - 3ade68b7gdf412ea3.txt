SHE'S THE ONE

No use in pretending, it's not been and gone
There's no defending, this feeling's all too strong
Every time and every place, I see magic in your eyes
I wanna see you feel you hold you tight
Till hell ices over I'll be waiting tonight

Oh, she's the one
I was stripped right down now yeah
She had me reeling
Oh baby, she's the one
And nothing feels better
And I know now she's the only one

Dealing with emotions we can uncreate
Being held under, oh how you infatuate
Every step and every move I see it in your eyes
I wanna see you feel you hold you tight
Till hell ices over I'll be waiting tonight

Oh, baby, she's the one
I was cut right down now 
Oh, she left me reeling
Oh baby, she's the one
Nothing felt better
And I can't forget her she's the only one
Only one

[INSTRUMENTAL]

* Oh, she's the one
I was stripped right down now yeah
She left me reeling
Oh baby, she's the one
And nothing felt better
And I can't forget her she's the only one
Only one

* Repeat
Only one....she's the one...
