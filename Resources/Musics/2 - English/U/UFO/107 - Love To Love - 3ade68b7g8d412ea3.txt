LOVE TO LOVE

Oh it's been too many times and I can't go back 
Night bars, guitars, rundown motels like shacks 
What it mounts up to I don't want it at all 
Lost you I need you to stay

* Misty green and blue 
Love to love to love you 
Misty green and blue 
Love to love to Love you

To be something, to be near you 
I don't know where IÂ´m going to 
Love to love to love you

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Half the time it could seem funny 
The other half is just too sad 
This west bound moon's only rise and fall 
Lost you and I need you to stay

* Repeat

To be something, to be near you 
I don't know where I'm goin' to
Lost you and I need you to stay
