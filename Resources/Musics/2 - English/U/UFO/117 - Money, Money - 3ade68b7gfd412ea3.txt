MONEY, MONEY

Well I'm down, face tomorrow
I drown in this fool's sorrow
I hear the lies, who I choose
No alibis, never a trace I'm blue

* Well I'm not so proud
Baby I can see
You take my money
And you're laughing at me

**(I ain't no clown) (Money money)
And you're no debutante
I wanna give
How much do you want

*** Money
Look what you've done to me
Money
Hope on a third degree

You're so dumb
You got all the protection
Number one
you only intend to clown 
(Repeat***)
You're so cool
Playing glamour glamour
Full of school
But still in emerald
(Repeat***)
(Repeat*)
(Repeat**)
Money money you think I can't see
Take it all and you're laughing at me
(Repeat**)
(Repeat*** twice)
