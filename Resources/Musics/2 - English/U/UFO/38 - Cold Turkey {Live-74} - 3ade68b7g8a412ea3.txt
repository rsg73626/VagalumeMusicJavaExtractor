COLD TURKEY {LIVE-74}

---?? (can't figure out the first line)

Rolling in pain, wish I was a babe, I'll be again 
I'll be a good boy I wish I could 
Lord please have mercy misunderstood 
Cold turkey has got me on the run

Sent me to the right man, fever is high,

Wish I was a babe, I'd kiss the sky, 
I'll be a good boy, I wish I could,

Lord please have mercy, misunderstood 
Cold turkey, has got me on the run on the run babe, on the run

(relentless duet)

??? Writhing, fever is high, 
Wish I was a baby, wish I could die 
I'd be a good boy, I wish I could, 
Lord please have mercy, misunderstood 
Cold turkey has got me . . . On the run
