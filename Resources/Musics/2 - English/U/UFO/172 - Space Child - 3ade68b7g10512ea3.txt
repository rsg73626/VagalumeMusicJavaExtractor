SPACE CHILD

Goin' through pages
and lookin' down lines and lines 
Space of your life is only passing you by 
Space child ages as he turns and faces the lie 
Then after laughter was caught in his throat as he died
Fly on homeward

Worlds spinnin' by brings clouds in your eye tonight
The space of your life is only passing you by
