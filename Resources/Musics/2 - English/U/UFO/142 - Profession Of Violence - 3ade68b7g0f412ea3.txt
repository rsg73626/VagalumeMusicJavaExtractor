PROFESSION OF VIOLENCE

Hey babe what we gonna do 
No look behind me glances 
Straight time this time 
We'll take our chances 
Darling it's been so long 
Every lonely hour 
What the sinner pulls the trigger 
And the world turns sour

*Whisper in the wind 
Locked in silence 
Profession of violence 
Whisper on the wind 
Locked in silence 
Profession of violence

Try to pick up the pieces 
Maybe move away 
But the lifer 
Was only yesterday 
Down the halls of justice 
The echoes never fade 
Notches on my gun 
Another debt is paid

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]
