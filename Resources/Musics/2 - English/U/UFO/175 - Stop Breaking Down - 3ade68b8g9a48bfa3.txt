STOP BREAKING DOWN

Just leave another message
Pin it on your door
Don't hold your breath boy
She don't live here no more
The telephones disconnected
Papers fall out the box
The manager won't speak to me
Someone's changed the locks

Stop breaking down
Lisa don't live here no more
Stop breaking down
She's will always be your beautiful

She's in every hotel room
It looks and smells the same
One night in simi valley
Was washed up in the rain
The cell phones ringing dead
There's no one here to call
I ring missing persons now
They turn me to the wall

Stop breaking down
Lisa don't live here no more
Stop breaking down
She's will always be your beautiful
Stop breaking down
Lisa don't live here no more
Stop breaking down
She's will always be your beautiful
