DANCING WITH ST. PETER

She spun herself on this cotton reel
I'd turn away but my blood won't spill
She'd hide away inside a confession box
While a chinaman cuts up the rocks

You may pound your fist at the wall
And you may die for no cause at all
You may worship this meddlesome man
Led to the slaughter
A sacrificial lamb

Love feeds you
Love bleeds you
Slips right through your hands
Love scars you
Behold or be damned

She ain't here she's away
She's dancing with st. Peter
She won't be back again
She's dancing with st. Peter

The devil drives a mercedes benz
It's a tacky motif
His means to an end
He wears her youth like a feather in his cap
While jiving down to that peruvian rap

He's the man of the moment
She's the one of a kind
As life as in death your coil will unwind
So don't call yourself misunderstood
Cos underneath we're all damaged goods

Love finds you
Love blinds you
Slips right through your hands
Love scars you
Behold or be damned

She ain't here she's away
She's dancing with st. Peter
She won't be back again
She's dancing with st. Peter

She ain't here she's away
She's dancing with st. Peter
She won't be back again
She's dancing with st. Peter

There's a sign in the night sky
Some supernova
It's climbing so high
That's alright now
I'm stepping over 

She ain't here she's away
She's dancing with st. Peter
She won't be back again
She's dancing with st. Peter
