BABY BLUE

Bet you never thought that time would go so fast
Bet you never thought a memory would last
Is it wrapped up in boxes with your old fashioned crazies
Packed all away with life's scars and grazes

Hey baby blue 
I still remember you,
Still remember you 
In my life
Hey baby blue 
Where you running now,
Where you running now 
In your own life

Going round and round and round
In my little world
Going round and round and round
In my little world

Everytime I saw your face
There was magic in the air
I see a sunny San Francisco morning
Baby you meet me there
Sometimes I'm left wondering
Sometimes it makes me so blue
Let me take you down to Mexico
Cos I'm still in love with you

Everytime I get to thinking, thinking of you
Under a sweet corrella, does it burn you too
And if sometimes I wonder when,
When sleep don't come at night
I still move and I groove and I jump and shout
Oh God I'm still in for the fight

Hey baby blue 
I still remember you
Don't leave the world behind
Leave the world, 
Leave the world behind

Solo

Going round and round and round
In my little world
Going round and round and round
In my little world

Hey baby blue 
I still remember you,
Still remember you 
In my life
Hey baby blue 
Where you running now,
Where you running now 
In your own life


SWALLOW
(Mogg/Moore/Bonham) 

If sometimes I could make you happy
If sometimes you're feeling small
The truth is mine just to do what I wanna do
This love is mine just to say what I wanna say

Out on this lonely road
Cold coffee and a cigarette
Making a long distance call
I'm on some losing bet

We're not going down
We're not gonna take it baby
We're not going down
Anyway you want it
We're not going down
We just got to be together now
And if you're feeling hollow
Hey, hey now swallow

And if your love's been lost and forsaken
If you've been left passed up and broken too
The choice is yours just to be where you wanna be
And the truth is yours just to see what you wanna see

Out on this lonely road
Where the black top never ends
We're racing up the hills
But we're losing it on the bends

We're not going down
We're not gonna take it baby
We're not going down
Anyway you want it
We're not going down
We just got to be together now
And if you're feeling hollow
Hey, hey now swallow

Solo

We're not going down
We've gotta be there together babe
We're not going down
Anyway you want it now
We're not going down
We've gotta be there
We've just gotta be together babe
And just your crazy ways
Oh there's not an ordinary day
Oh no
