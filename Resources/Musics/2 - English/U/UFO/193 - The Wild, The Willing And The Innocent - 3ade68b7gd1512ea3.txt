THE WILD, THE WILLING AND THE INNOCENT

they don't seem to sound right, I have put them in [ ].
/Who's/ ["He's"] dressed to kill, out to thrill 
Waiting for you tonight 
Got my ear down to the ground 
Waiting for the warning sound 
Something's got to bite

* And I 'm looking for a wild rose 
In the heat of the night

Waiting for a show 
Looking for a wild rose 
In the heat of the night 
Waiting for a show

** And the wild, the willing and the innocent 
Are down, down in the jungle tonight 
As the jackal tracks every step you make 
Watching, waiting for the one chance to bite

Time was right, a satin light 
In the final dangerous game 
/Trap set,/ ["Attracted"] in the net 
Feel my hands start to sweat 
Ooh I'm taking aim

Repeat * 
Repeat **

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Cold black steel, your last meal 
The hand of fate has come 
Phone taps, blueprint maps 
Making my nerve ends snap 
/Public Enemy Number One/ ["Call me again I'll be your number one"]

Repeat * 
Repeat **
