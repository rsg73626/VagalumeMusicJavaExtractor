LOVIN' CUP

Early in the morning when the sun come up 
I sat there drinking from your loving cup 
Tell me pretty babe what can i do 
Wanna drink from your loving cup 
On the sunday morn you're acting funny 
You should be working earning money 
Slow down baby you move too fast 
Wanna come and catch ya laying in the grass

Tell me pretty babe what can i do 
Wanna drink from your loving cup

(instrumental)

Just wanna drink from your loving cup yeah
