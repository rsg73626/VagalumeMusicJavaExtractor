ONE HEART

The elevator it goes right to the 21st floor 
he's steppin' out and she walks right through the president's door 
In this world you know you're just a fool to take 
He'll give you something adds up to nothing 
It's your heart that breaks

* One heart stands alone 
Stripped right down to the bone 
One heart easy to break
( /How much more can you take/Tell me now that this is just a mistake)

He sits up there like a king oh in the company chair 
He'll cast you right but you know it's just so unfair 
So you're one more number now in his telephone book 
It shows nothing you've got something from the pleasure he took

* Repeat twice

So you think you're found it, your one big break, got what it takes 
And you're tough enough to spot all those fakes, your first mistake 
But you've got something that survives
A burnin' heart stays alive 
And now I wish you could do with me 
Oh baby you just couldn't see

[INSTRUMENTAL]

He'll give you your something, adds up to nothing, and your heart breaks

* Repeat three times then start fading
