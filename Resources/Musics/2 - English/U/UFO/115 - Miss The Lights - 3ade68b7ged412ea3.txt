MISS THE LIGHTS

(intro) Walking tall, full of tedious charm,
The smoothest (???) in (???)
The mission boys all cross their palms
Don't you know who I am

I guess you miss the lights? Huh!
I guess you miss the fame
I guess you miss everybody
Hanging onto your name

Little Caesar is prince of the city
???
In this town there's no pity
This man stands alone

I guess you miss the lights - ha!
I guess you miss the fame
I guess you miss everybody
Hanging onto your name

Sometimes when you're all alone
and the blue turns to gray
Better get down on those pinky knees,
and you start to pray

I guess you miss the lights - ha!
I guess you miss the fame
I guess you miss everybody
Kiss-kissing your name

(instrumental)

A glimmering ?, A twilight star
And so much love for show,
A returning wave from the gallery bar
And share the afterglow

I guess you miss the lights
I guess you miss the fame
I guess you miss everybody
Hanging onto your name
Ha!
I guess you miss the lights
I guess you miss the fame, haha!
I guess you miss everybody
Hanging onto your name

(fade out music and chorus)
I guess you miss the lights
I guess you miss everybody
Kiss-kissing your name
