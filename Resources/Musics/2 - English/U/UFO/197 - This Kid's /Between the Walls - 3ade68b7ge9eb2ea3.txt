THIS KID'S /BETWEEN THE WALLS

Kid's gettin' tired, hangin' around
So cocksure, thinkin' aloud
Can't get it in (when you) can't get it out
Sure ain't enough and there ain't no doubt

You can't stop a train with just a smile
Stop me at the start only for a while
Hole in my pocket and a hole in my arm
All that's left when life's lost it's charm

This could be for us just any other day
So come on girl, we really got to get away
It's the only chance you'll ever have to change
Or stick in this city will drive you insane

*

Can't win or lose when there's little left to choose
Now 'til next year it'll always be the same
The black backstreets and people who don't know your name
Go with the wind if it'll only carry us away
