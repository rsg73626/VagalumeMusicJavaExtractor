HOT 'N' READY

You knock me out you're like a well oiled Smith & Wesson
Hot & Ready, ready to use
Dressed to the nines, you know you don't look 15, there's no question
Hot & Ready, ready to use
I'm coming through I've gotta get to you babe
I'm coming through I've gotta get to you babe

Don't need I.D. and there's no house detective to crowd you...
Hot & Ready, ready to use
Slip in the back door and slip out of what ever your into
Hot & Ready, ready to use
I'm coming through I've gotta get to you babe (2x)

---(instrumental)---

I'm coming through, I've gotta get to you babe (2x)
