PRECIOUS CARGO

Put on your long black morning gown
Get on your crazy horse crown
Sat here watching oh a dead man blow
It's cold outside riding the winter snow

And if it comes tomorrow
And if it comes today
I don't see this working out
With the one that got away

The scatter roller's coming down
Summer's been and turned around
It don't seem so long ago
That you were my precious cargo
The scatter roller's coming down
Summer's been and turned around
It don't seem so long ago
That you were my precious cargo
My precious cargo, my precious cargo

The truth is stacked in this deck of cards
A promise lost wrapped in these ivory barbs
Elizabeth sings oh she's my queen of hearts
Souls of men die and actors pick up the parts

If it comes tomorrow
If it comes today
I don't see this working out
With the one that got away

The scatter roller's coming down
Summer's been and turned around
It don't seem so long ago
That you were my precious cargo
The scatter roller's coming down
Summer's been and turned around
It don't seem so long ago
That you will always be my precious cargo
My precious cargo
You'll always be my precious cargo

If it comes tomorrow
If it comes today
I don't see this working out
With the one that got away

The scatter roller's coming down
Oh my booty's back around
It don't seem so long ago
That you were my precious cargo
The scatter roller's coming down
Summer's been and turned around
It don't seem so long ago
That you were my precious cargo
The scatter roller's coming down
Summer's been and gone around
It don't seem so long ago
You were my precious precious cargo
