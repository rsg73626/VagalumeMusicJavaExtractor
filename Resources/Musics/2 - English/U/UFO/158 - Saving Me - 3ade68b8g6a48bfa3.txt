SAVING ME

Some men come from nothing
Some men will not bend
Some will do the bleeding
Til the bitter end

If i was an angel
I could make it rain
Up upon the wild wild wood
Like brother cain

Some men come from nothing
Some men will not bend
Some will do the bleeding
Til the bitter end

If i was an angel
I could make it rain
Up upon the wild wild wood
Like brother cain

And the devils and the clowns
Whiskey rye and cinders
She's the one

Save me from falling
Come and save my mortal soul
Save me from drowning
Oh baby i don't know
Which way to go

No one comes to see me
No one knows my name
I'm the lonely stranger
A visitor by name
No no no
Turn me around
Whiskey rye and ginger
Devil wears a crown
My only crime is sinning
I'm homeward bound
Hold me tighter before i drown

Save me from falling
Come and save my mortal soul
Save me from drowning
And save my mortal soul

Sometimes baby now
I gotta hear you calling

Save me from falling
Come and save my mortal soul
Save me from drowning
And save my mortal soul
