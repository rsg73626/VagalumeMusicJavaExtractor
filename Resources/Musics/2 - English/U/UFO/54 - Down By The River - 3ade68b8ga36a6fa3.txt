DOWN BY THE RIVER

Down By The River

It was a blinding light
A sheer tornado of pain
I had a whisky fury
Pounding like the devils rain

Down by the river
It's alright
I've been turning stones
Down by the river
It's alright
Someone's been catching a rabbit
About midnight

Up on a mountain side
I was touching heaven
I was a servant boy
But I was just a killer

Down by the river
I've been turning stones
Down by the river
It's alright
Someone's been catching a rabbit
About midnight

We don't take no prisoners here
Down by the river

Ain't no mystery here
Mystery in this world of mine
Hold on baby
Hold on to this night
