EVERYBODY KNOWS

I got your number right off the wall 
Bristol 285 wont you give me a call 
Well I was 15 thought I was hot 
I didn't know if you'd see me or not 
And that night as we stepped out 
We were hand in hand 
But my friends all seemed to know you 
I couldn't understand 

That everybody knew, everybody knew, they knew your name 
But nobody wants nobody wants to play your game 

You seemed so shy so all alone-y 
Without any hint of ever being phony 
But then the little things that came to light
Like the strange hours you worked late at night
And as we laid in your bed that night 
You made me feel like a king
Then as I looked into your eyes
I heard that telephone ring 

And everybody knows, everybody knows, they know your name
But nobody wants, nobody wants, to play your game
Oh no, they don't want to know your game again 

(instrumental)

And everybody knows, everybody knows, they know your name
Nobody wants, nobody wants, to play your game

And everybody knew, everybody knew, they knew your name 
But nobody wants nobody wants to play your game

(instrumental to the end...)
