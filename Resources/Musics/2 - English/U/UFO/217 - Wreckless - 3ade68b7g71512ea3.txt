WRECKLESS

So this is it, have we come to the end 
No more fun, oh my friend 
But I'll take my chances now 
Lettin' loose again

Wreckless weekends, weekends 
Led by my heart, not my head 
Tearing this whole world apart

I found something no one steals 
It's love of life, it's so real 
And I know it's hard for you 
But here I go again

Wreckless weekends, weekends 
Led by my heart, not my head 
Tearing this whole world apart 
Bringing me down when it starts

And if it's a lifetime term 
Babe I guess I'll never learn 
Got to make a stand right here tonight

Got the fever right to my feet 
Kicking my heels and I'm coming on heat, 
Tonight's the night we make it real 
Oh baby, it's a steal 
* It's no good tomorrow, it's too far away 
I'm keeping my hand in, you gotta stay
There's no time for makeup, just put on your shoes 
You know we've got nothing to lose

** Wreckless, born for a wild weekend 
Wreckless, pushing it 'til the end

I'm tired of Houston, it sticks in my throat 
I'm gonna swim, not gonna float 
So break these chains and let me loose 
'Cuz if I can't win, I'm gonna choose

* Repeat 
** Repeat

** And I can't stand one more lonely night 
Without a love that's got no fight 
Oh baby, let me know 
C'mon sugar, let it show 
One more time, we will know 
I gotta keep you, can't let you go

[INSTRUMENTAL]

*** Repeat 
** Repeat twice then let the instruments take it on home!
