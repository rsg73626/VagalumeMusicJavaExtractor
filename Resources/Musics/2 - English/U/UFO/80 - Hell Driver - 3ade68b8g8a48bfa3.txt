HELL DRIVER

Now picture this
Here's a story
God rides down to mexico
Got no friends and no one i know
A cactus sign at the end of the street
A mariachi and a one way beat

Hey hell driver looking for a midnight rider
Baby stuck down in mexico all night long

Hey hell driver looking for a midnight rider
All night all night long
Chiquita all night long

Music playing flamenco beat
There's a cactus sign on my street
Hey hombre let me take you home
Sweet chiquita all alone

Hey hell driver looking for a midnight rider
No lo bebas tequila
Not tonight

Hey hell driver looking for a midnight rider
All night long
My chiquita

Oh baby baby
Can i please come home
I got a pocket full here now of pretty pretty stones
I sold my soul down in puerto viato last week
Down on my luck
I ain't got a winning streak

Struck inside a roadhouse
I got a midnight tan
Sold my soul in puerto viato anything i can
Here in my darkness i can feel the rain
Sitting in this jailhouse
Come on baby feel the pain
