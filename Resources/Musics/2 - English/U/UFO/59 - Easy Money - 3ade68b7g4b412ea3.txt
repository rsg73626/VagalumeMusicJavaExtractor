EASY MONEY

Let's go -- while we're young!

Moving easy money, how far to the street 
Close-in complications better keep your nose clean, better move my feet 
Moves me like a winner I'm turning up the heat 
I've gotta get me something I want to feel some friction, want to feel some heat 
Keep your pretentions feel this beat

Easy money I'm a rolling dice now 
Give me something but your good advice 
Easy money I'm a rolling dice now, easy money

Sticky situations and a woman's revelations 
I've gotta feel something, wanna feel some friction, wanna feel this heat 
Keep your pretentions feel this beat 
Easy money I'm a rolling dice now 
I don't need nothing, your good advice 
Easy money I'm a rolling dice now easy money

Look into my soul, and the night life of Amsterdam

Laid down in Stockholm, I'll always be your fan 
Wind blows off the twilight, sunset in L.A. 
The powers of the world, easy money's OK

Instrumental

Easy money I'm a rolling dice now 
Give me something but your advice 
Easy money I'm a rolling dice now 
Give me something but your good advice 
Easy money and a rolling dice now 
Give ms something I won't think twice 
Easy money I'm a rolling dice now, 
Easy money easy money, hold on tight now 
Easy money I'm a rolling dice 
Give me money, easy money....
