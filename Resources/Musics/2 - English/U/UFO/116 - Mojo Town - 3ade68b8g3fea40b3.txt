MOJO TOWN

Hey, hey! Ah, yeah!

If I could just one night
Steal within your soul
Would I find something special
Or just one big hole

I've been in your kitchen
Wish I could've stayed
I've been in your heart, babe
As it only for a day

Goin' on down, goin' down
Going down to Mojo town
Goin' on down, goin' on down
Going down to Mojo town

I'm going down babe
Now I'm mojo town

And it would please me greatly
If time stood still
For I'd be walking backwards
And that's my will

With a hidden fire
With a love like a funeral pyre
With a memory that won't fade
I'm left with a burning blade

Goin' on down, goin' down
Going down to Mojo town
Goin' on down, goin' on down
Going down to Mojo town

I'm burning your captain
Wish I could have stayed
I'm burning your heart babe
Is it only for a day

Goin' on down, goin' round
Going now Mojo town
Goin' on down, goin' on down
Going down to Mojo town

Hey yeah! I'm going down now
I'm gonna run to town, hey
