THE ONLY ONES

Can you feel me, I'm so close I'm sure 
Anytime if you would call be right to your door 
Is it over, lost this time for good 
I never knew that I could be so misunderstood

* We are the only ones, left alone with this heart of stone 
We are the only ones with nothin' left but fools alone

Life's so empty, there's nothin' left for me 
Oh I wish you were back, baby you and me 
Last September, it's like yesterday 
You slipped through my hands, there's nothing more to say

* Repeat

I can feel the magic in your heart tonight 
I thought we had something oh so right 
Baby tell me do you still care 
'Cause this ain't no game of kiss and dare

[INSTRUMENTAL]

* Repeat twice then go into the instrumental fade out
