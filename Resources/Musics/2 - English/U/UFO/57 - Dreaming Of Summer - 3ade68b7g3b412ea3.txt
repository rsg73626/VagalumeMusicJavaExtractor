DREAMING OF SUMMER

*
Woke up on a Manchester morning
No sun up on the sky
Caught the train down to London
So broke I could make you cry
When you get right down to it
There's really nothing in it

I got a copy of the evening paper
If there's a job I will apply
The DHS says it's now or never
This is a case of do or die

When it comes right down to it
I've got to struggle through it

**
Put the lights way down low
Come closer
Tell me heroes don't fade away, they're forever
Just a little bit of something
Just a little bit of real 
Tell me heroes don't fade away, become a memory
So come on darling now
I still need to know
Are we gonna fade away or stay forever

Took a walk down to Soho
I've got T.V. on my mind
It says these days you have it easy
Oh Lord, I must be blind
When it comes right down to it
I can see right on through it

I really love my old lady
Much more grief she can't take
Wish I could take her somewhere fancy
I still need that lucky break

When it comes right down to it
There's really nothing in it

Repeat **

And I'm dreaming of summer
Of just me and you now

But a love with no money
How long will it ring true

One big city smells like another
I get lost in this maze
When I get home should I lie
The bottle's gone I'm in a daze

When it comes right down to it
I've got to struggle through it

Things look bleak out of this window
Sometimes I wanna run away
And the light fades down this tunnel
It merges into another day

Repeat *
