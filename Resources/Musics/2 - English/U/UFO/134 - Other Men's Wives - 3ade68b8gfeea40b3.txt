OTHER MEN'S WIVES

Well the thunder came and the wind did howl
Plague of rats and the dogs did growl

I can't help you, wouldn't if I could
I should help you, wouldn't if I could
You're a stain in my neighbourhood
I wouldn't help you if I could

I caught my baby with another man
I'm gonna kill 'em both because I can
Shot 'em right between the eyes
You don't mess with other men's wives

Well the dancers jiggled the band played on
Smell of sweat before I'm gone
Death by cop and death by band
Feel the fury of a dead man's hand

I can't help you, wouldn't if I could
I should help you, wouldn't if I could
You're a stain in my neighbourhood
I wouldn't help you if I could

I caught my baby with another man
I'm gonna kill 'em both because I can
Shot 'em right between the eyes
You don't mess with other men's wives
No, no, no, no

Caught my baby with another man
I'm gonna kill 'em both because I can
Shot 'em right between the eyes
You don't mess with other men's wives
Other men's wives
You don't mess with other men's wives
Kick your hands of both
No mess with me
Don't mess with me
Don't squire
Don't with me
