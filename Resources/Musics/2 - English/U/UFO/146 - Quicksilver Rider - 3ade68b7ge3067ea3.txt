QUICKSILVER RIDER

I see the raven's eyes,
and I see the lights
I saw the gold rush
San Francisco nights
I am the reader,
a palmist fly
I can see the future,
I can testify
I knew Attilla,
I met Genghis Khan
Drank with Napoleon,
held Nelson in my arms


Quicksilver rider
medicine man
A sign of faith
children of the damned
Quicksilver rider
salamander man
Prophet of the guises
with the world in his hands


I've known love
I've known pain
Death and sorrow
the mighty and the slain
I was created
in 10 BC
The sign of life
the sign of seed


I met Moses,
I know Jezebel
Partied with Nero
as Rome burned and fell


Quicksilver rider
medicine man
A sign of faith
children of the damned
Quicksilver rider
salamander man
Prophet of the guises
with the world in his hands

Solo

Rattlesnakes heads
and voodoo dolls
It's old religion
like old creole
I am the dust of
time and space
Your darkest nightmare
without a face


I saw sunrise
from Enola Gay
Sat down with Ghandi
and started to pray



Quicksilver rider
medicine man
A sign of faith
children of the damned
Quicksilver rider
salamander man
Prophet of the guises
with the world in his hands



Quicksilver rider
medicine man
A sign of faith
children of the damned
Quicksilver rider
salamander man
Prophet of the guises
with the world in his hands
