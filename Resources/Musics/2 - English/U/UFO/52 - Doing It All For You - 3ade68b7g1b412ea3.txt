DOING IT ALL FOR YOU

Lights turn red to green 
I haven't been spotted I seen 
Four more blocks and I'm safe 
Make it clean without a chase

There's something special, certain feeling 
I can't blow this one for sure 
I've been nervous, anxious and edgy 
This one's the last one there'll be no more 
What I've got to do tonight 
Take the car and meet the man downtown 
It's easy darling, working away 
Before the word's got around

* And I'll do it all for you, oh yes I will 
This time I'm coming through, oh yeah

I said I'm burning, I been rolling 
This car's turned up to make it fly 
Don't worry darling just get ready 
Tonight we're gonna be going out in style 
If anyone comes calling around 
Don't answer 'cause you're my alibi 
So just trust me, kiss me and love me 
Chasing the golden mile

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

* Repeat
