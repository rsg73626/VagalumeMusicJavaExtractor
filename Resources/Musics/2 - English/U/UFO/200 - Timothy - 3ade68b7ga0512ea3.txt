TIMOTHY

Timothy tries but he can't explain

All of the things that shatter his brain 
comes from the garden shouting and grinning 
Hey Timothy where do you come from

Only befriended Jeremy (Mouth?)... 
seems to know what Timmy's talking about 
comes from the garden shouting and grinning 
Hey Timothy where do you come from

(instrumental)p>
Does he come from the sky? Does he come from the land? 
Does he come from the earth? Does he come from the sea? Timothy?

Hey timothy now where do you come from, where do you come from Timothy? 
Hey Timothy, where do you come from, where do you come from Timothy?

(instrumental)
