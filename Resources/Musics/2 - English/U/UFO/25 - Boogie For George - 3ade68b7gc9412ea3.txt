BOOGIE FOR GEORGE

Goin' down to George's where you just have been 
To see if you've been boogie-ing, ah you know what I mean 
My left leg's dragging my right leg's l imp 
My heads so wavy and i can't feel it 
I gotta see you baby, you'll be alright 
I wanna boogie baby, boogie tonight 

--long jam-

Well old George is boogie-ing he's been a boogie-ing with you 
Ah I wanna boogie w u baby 
I wanna boogie all night long 
I wanna move with you I wanna move 
I wanna shake, wanna boogie too 
I wanna boogie . . . boogie 
(---jam-and fade--)
