SERENADE

Hey hey put me in your pocket for a day
Let me hold the rhythm of your sway
Let me steal you with this serenade, serenade
Hey hey, I could see the magic in your eyes,
There's a fire beneath these Spanish skies,
Let me steal you with this serenade, serenade

(instrumental)

Hey hey, let me mix you up a recipe, here's doctor love to give you therapy
Let me steal you with this serenade, serenade
Out on the beach, blueprint of your soul, with the midnight of the city
A thousand eyes look down from space

(more instrumental)

Hey hey, put me in your pocket for a day, let me hold the rhythm of your sway
Let me steal you with this serenade, serenade
(more instrumental, fading out eventually)
