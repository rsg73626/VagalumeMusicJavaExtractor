MAKIN' MOVES

All the boys hangin' out down in the parking lot 
The night riders giving all they got 
While the girls look so good at looking bad 
/Out strutting/ ["I'm struggling"] dressed in the latest fad 
Valentino looks for something new 
Escapes for the night and waits his cue 
And I love the way they make their move 
Yes I love the way they're makin' moves

Kids clothe armour hands like battle dress 
Got his act down, some kind of feeling 
And tonight they're gonna make the run 
Downtown, call the garrison 
From the back roads through the alleys it screams 
You gotta get a feeling mean, mean, mean 
And I love the way they make their move 
Yes I love the way they're makin' moves

[INSTRUMENTAL]

"Rockface" going nowhere fast 
Some gonna make it, some don't even last 
Just one night they don't give a damn 
I'm the star, hides another sham 
There's no silver and there's no gold 
It's just that one shot before they're old 
And I love the way they make their move 
Yes I love the way they make you move 
Ooh I love I just love the way they make their move 
Makin' moves
