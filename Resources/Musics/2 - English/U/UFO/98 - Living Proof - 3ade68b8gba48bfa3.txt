LIVING PROOF

Rock this down
Ruff this place
I see sugar all over your face
She jives softly
She jives mine
She make love like a capital crime

Hand me down my shiny shoes
And mohair suit that's news
I'm giving up my weekend
I'm fixing up a fuse
Give me up molasses
Put me on the roof
Call me up barumba
I'm a living proof

Shake shake
Shake this town

I jump willy
I jump mine

I jump baby she can spin on a dime
Cool her up or you can cool her down
She move me crazy
She do the brown
Murder of crowns
The laying on of hands
Driving in the dead zone
With no map or plans

Give me up molasses
Put me on the roof
Call me up barumba
I'm a living proof

Shake shake
Shake this town

Walk any mountain
I don't care
Big brown bear
Ha ain't going nowhere

You made some sugar on it
Show me the walk
Give me that sweet southern talk
