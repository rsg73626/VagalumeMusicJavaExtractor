LIGHTS OUT

Wind blows back on the battens charging
winds all the way 
Right to the butt of my gun 
Maybe now your time has come

From the backstreets there's a rumblin'
Smell of anarchy 
No more nice times, black boy shoe shines 
Pie in the sky dreams

* Lights out, lights out in London 
Hold tight 'til the end 
Better now you know we'll never 
Wait 'til tomorrow 
Lights out, lights out in London 
Hold tight 'til the end 
God knows when I'm comin' on [my] run

You keep coming, there's no ending 
That's the way it goes 
Private thoughts, once been tought 
And now it shows

* Repeat

[Solo]

* Repeat

Listen to you is like the moon in june
I've tried a thousand times
Under your feet grass is growin'
Time we said goodbye

* Repeat
