MESSIAH OF LOVE

I'm gonna love you
I got a kiss just like a killer bee
Someone to roll you
Climbing up on your cherry tree

Up to the limit
Up to the sky
A kiss goodnight
The long good bye

Let me show you what's more than enough
Let me show you the messiah of love
Let me take you to heaven above
Let me give you the messiah of love

Someone to soothe you
Up and down life's greasy pole
I'm gonna save you
Turn you around and give you jelly roll

Up to the limit
Up to the sky
A kiss goodnight
The long good bye

Let me show you what's more than enough
Let me show you the messiah of love
Let me take you to heaven above
Let me give you the messiah of love

Some come to do battle
Some just come for more
And I'm here to tell you darling
I'm going to settle my score

Let me show you what's more than enough
Let me show you the messiah of love
Let me take you to heaven above
Let me give you the messiah of love
