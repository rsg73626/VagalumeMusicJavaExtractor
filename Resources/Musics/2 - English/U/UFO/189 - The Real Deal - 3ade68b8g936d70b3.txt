THE REAL DEAL

Shoo shoo my mama took me to delights
She go dizzy without warning
She'll wrap you up like a Saturday night
Show you zumtum till the morning

You can hear the angels singing
El Diablo Amsterdam
Lying on a naked bed
I can hear the radio jam

No more sleeping, cos this is the real deal, yes it is
No more talking now, cos this is the real deal, yes I am
I won't be forsaking, cos this is the real, real, real deal, baby
No more faking, cos this is the real deal, baby

She spins me round like a donkey by the tail
She has a mystical power
She points her finger to the gunpowder trail
I think I'm climbing higher

You can hear the angels singing
El Diablo Amsterdam
Spread out here on the naked sheet
Listening to the radio jam

No more sleeping, cos this is the real deal, yes it is
I ain't for faking, cos this is the real deal, yes it is
I ain't forsaking, cos this is the real deal, oh yeah
No more faking, cos this is the real deal, the real deal, baby

And we said goodbye to the morning
And the falling sky
The meanest year we ever saw
Before we said goodbye
Goodbye

This is the real deal, oh yeah
This is the real deal, baby
Come on, give it up, I'm gonna go
This is the real deal
Accept no substitute
This is the real deal
This is the real deal
