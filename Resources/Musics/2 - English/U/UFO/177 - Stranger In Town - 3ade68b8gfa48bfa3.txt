STRANGER IN TOWN

Mr walking tall
This is an early call
It's judgement day
Mr talking fool
All roads lead to you
There gonna be hell to pay

If the fish don't eat you
Oh the money will
If i don't beat you
Someone will

There's a stranger in town
There's a stranger in town

Mr shoestring
He's the class
There's 3.57
Gonna shove it up your

Mr high society
Swinging from a tree now
Hanging on a gibbet
Mr walking talk
His accomplices
Everybody's here
Take no blow
Everybody's at the party
Everybody's knows your name
So sweet the hangman's singing
Sometimes you gotta fall
Down down down

Everybody's at the party
Everybody's knows your name
So sweet the hangman's singing
This time i know your game
You gotta kill them now
