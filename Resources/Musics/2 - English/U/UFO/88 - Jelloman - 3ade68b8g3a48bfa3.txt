JELLOMAN

Hey yeah yeah
Give up that booze
And take out the trash
Give up the night life
And stop smoking that hash
Give up the good sex
It's a heart attack
Surrender life
Wrap it up in a sack

All dressed up in the king's new clothes
Climbing up the monkey's nose
Standing out like a stiff on parade
You're overworked and underpaid

Jello man, jello man
Got you on the run
Jello man, jello man
Blocking out the sun
Jello man, jello man
Beating on his drum
Jello man, jello man
Got you on the run yeah

Stop all the traffic
Put this time on hold
Stop all the press
Cos it's been bought and sold
Stop the revolution
There's nothing left to fight
Will the last man standing
Turn out the light

Standing out with the freaks in the cold
Sucking down on a Virginia gold
The cabaret's all dressed for the kill
They'll stiff you now and give you the bill

Jello man, jello man
Got you on the run
Jello man, jello man
Blocking out the sun
Jello man, jello man
Beating on his drum
Jello man, jello man
Got you on the run yeah

Jello man, jello man
Got you on the run
Jello man, jello man
Blocking out the sun
Jello man, jello man
Beating on his drum
Jello man, jello man
Got you on the run yeah

Jello Man
