PRINCE KAJUKU

Catch a falling star put it in your pocket 
Take hold of the moonbeams, hang them around your neck

Prince Kajuku's coming feathers in his hair 
Tapping on his juju stick, take you down there

Prince Kajuku holds you never lets you go 
Feel his power around you when your weakness shows 
Take a starry circle hold it in your hand 
Never let Kajuku take [guide] you to his land

Long space jam

Catch a falling star put it in your pocket
Take hold of the moonbeams hang them round your neck 
Kajuku, Kajuku, walking down the street 
Tapping on his juju stick, take you down there
