THE WAY THE WILD WIND BLOWS

I heard from Frankie there's trouble at his place
On Highway 95 the police they gave me chase
I was with his sister I hadn't seen a thing
They had an APB just to bring me in

* Oh, I had Jenny by my side
Oh, she never told me that she'd lied

** If that's the way (that) our love goes
I'll take my chances with you I know
And we'll go the way the wild wind blows

I wasn't gonna stop they'd have to catch me first
And as I ran the red I heard the gunfire burst
Across three counties chasin' me for days
But Judge I didn't know that she was under age

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Well the judge he was generous and gave me a rest
Of eighteen months in the county's best
And I got a visit from Jenny yesterday
By the time I'm out everything will be OK

* Repeat
** Repeat

She gave me one look
You could see it in her eyes
And we'll go the way the wild wind blows

*** And while I'm away dream of dreams
That what we had no one had seen
Because we go the way the wild wind blows

*** Repeat and fade
