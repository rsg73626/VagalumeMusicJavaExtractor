YOU'LL GET LOVE

I heard you tiptoe in last night 
Cross the porch stars were bright 
Past my room and into yours 
Sliding locks and chaining doors

* You'll get love 
My kind of love 
(You'll get love) / (I'll give you love) 
The love you give to me (yeah)

I see the men that come and go 
Through a hole that doesn't show 
Every day we pass in the hall 
I'm like a picture on the wall

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

I hear your giggles and little sighs 
Close my eyes and fantasize 
But as you're sleeping a room away 
In the dark you hear the jackal play

* Repeat
