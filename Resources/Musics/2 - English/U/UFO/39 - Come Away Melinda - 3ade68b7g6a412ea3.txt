COME AWAY MELINDA

Daddy daddy, come and look, (come and) see what I have found 
A little ways away from here, while digging in the ground 

Come Away Melinda, come in and close the door 
That thing's just a picture book they had before the war.

Daddy daddy, come and see, daddy, hurry, do! 
(Why) There's someone in a (party/pretty) dress and she's all grown up just like you 
(Wont' you tell me why)

Come away Melinda, come in and close the door 
(That) "Someone" is your mommy, you had before the war.

Daddy daddy tell me (please tell me) if you can 
Why things can't be the way they were before this war began? 

Come away Melinda, come in and close the door 
The answer lies in yesterday, before they had the war...
