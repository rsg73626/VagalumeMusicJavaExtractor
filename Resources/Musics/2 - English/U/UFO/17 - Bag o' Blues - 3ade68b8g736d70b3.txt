BAG O' BLUES

Well my beautiful distraction
Where're you gone
Everything's closing where I belong
And it's bad news
I'm losing you
I got this bag full of blues

The black eye beyond
In a bitter bottle town
Everyone here wears a worried frown
I didn't get the choice to pick and choose
I got a bag full of blues

Darkness has fallen
I'm going south
They say that butter wouldn't melt
In your mouth
But my demise won't make the
Morning news
All I got is this
Bag full of blues

Shake me down now honey
I got nothing to lose
I got a bag full of blues

Oh, my beautiful distraction
Where're you gone
Everything's closing where
I don't belong
And it's a bad, bad day
'N bad news
I got a bag full of blues
A bag full of blues

Hey babe
A bag full of blues
