ON WITH THE ACTION

Something going on at the corner of the block
It's the kids down there
They were startin' to rock
High black fever runnin' everyplace
When the Greek kid pulled a knife
and pushed it in his face
Some girl makes it with a lover in the door...
As the ambulance pulls away,
she cries out more

* And it's all night long, all night long
On with the action
You need the fastest legs alive
On with the action
If you can't run you ain't gonna survive
On with the action
Mama's boy and teacher's pet...
On with the action
It's down our street, is it in yours yet

All the kids stand laughin'
They never had such fun
Then someone cuts a blind man who just can't make a run
And the queen who's been standin' behind the toilet door
His parents don't like boyfriends, call him a whore
But the minister's starin'
with his bible in his hand
Was this God's children, he didn't understand

* Repeat
* Repeat
