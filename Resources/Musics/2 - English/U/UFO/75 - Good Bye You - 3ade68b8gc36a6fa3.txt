GOOD BYE YOU

Good Bye You

Strange is that how we look
In my house now it's an open book
Strange that's a place
We don't go there and we don't leave a trace

Well it's out of my pocket
Out of control
I am still in love with you baby
So is it

Goodbye you Goodbye me
Goodbye you Goodbye me
Goodbye you Is It Goodbye me
Goodbye you Goodbye me

Strange we still touch
Do we hold on now far too much
Strange is that a gift from above
Oh how we live

And it's out of my pocket
It's out of control
I still love you to my very soul
Is it

Goodbye you Goodbye me
Goodbye you Goodbye me
Goodbye you Is It Goodbye me
Goodbye you Goodbye me
