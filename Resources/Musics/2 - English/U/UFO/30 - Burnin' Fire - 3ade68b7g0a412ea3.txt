BURNIN' FIRE

Well she struck like lightning
Sent the blood rushing to my head
And she was so exciting
I took a walk I didn't have to be led

* And I had my highlights, I had it all
I thought that life was my crystal ball
Now there's a highway running
She drove a truck right through my life

** I jumped in to the burnin' fire
Led by lust and my desire
I jumped in to the burnin' fire
Led by lust my desire

Well I was born a preacher
Fire and brimstone I'm a Baptist man
She was God's own creature
What she didn't know you wouldn't understand now

* Repeat
** Repeat


[INSTRUMENTAL]

Well she skipped across the floor
And she looked so fine
With her hair flowing back
I thought she was mine
I dreamed on in my own head
Now lord I wish I was dead

** Repeat
** Repeat

I jumped in, I jumped in
To the burnin' fire
And you don't win
I jumped in, I jumped in
To the burnin' fire
And you don't win

** Repeat and fade out
