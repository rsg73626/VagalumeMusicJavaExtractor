HEAVENLY BODY

Heavenly Body

First changing mirrors
Fly up on the wall
Hi honking honey
This is my call
Oh I'm changing faces
I guess I'm Mr. Hyde

It was a hard heavenly body
It was a hard heavenly body

Burning like a bush fire
Sinking in the mire
I trapped her like a birdie
Caught her in the wire
And when it all comes down babe
I am left sitting on your fire

It was a hard heavenly body
It was a hard heavenly body

I am stuck down here in the street
With a Chinese bone
And Chinese feet
It was a hard heavenly body

It was a hard heavenly body
It was a hard heavenly body

Oh I'm changing faces
I guess I'm Mr. Hyde
