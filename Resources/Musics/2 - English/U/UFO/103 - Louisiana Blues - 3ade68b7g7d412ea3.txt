LOUISIANA BLUES

--- I'm going to Louisiana baby behind the stars 
I'm going to Louisiana baby behind the stars 
And though I just found out my troubles just begun

I'm going to N'Orleans get me a hold of your hand
I'm going New Orleans get me a hold your hand 
I'm gong to take you with me, right under my command

If the river was whiskey I would [drink all it up????] 
If the river was whiskey I would [drink all it up???]
And though I'd swim to the bottom, drink myself back up, all right

(Instrumental)

(Repeat verses 1 and 3)
