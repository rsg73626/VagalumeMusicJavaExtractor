LETTIN' GO

I'm lettin' go now, Don't think I can last 
I'm lettin' go now, I've been living too fast

I'm not up in the morning Arid beat the clock at night
it's got so damn predictable, Feel I'm doing time

**Oh no I can't Stand another day
I see those gates a' closing
Caught in the ricochet
Oh no my life's in miniature
I'll be here forever
How much more can a poor boy take
When all he needs is an even break

I'm lettin' go now
Work is driving me crazy 
Lettin' go now
Take a lot save me

Started when I was sixteen it's been just like a drug 
I'm working every day You'd think I was in love
