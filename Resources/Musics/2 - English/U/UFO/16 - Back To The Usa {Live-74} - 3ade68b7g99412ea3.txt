BACK TO THE USA {LIVE-74}

I'm going back, back, I'm going back, yeah 
I'm going back baby, I'm going back, yeah 
I'm going back, back to the usa

Hello, Mary, did you get back today 
Just got in, in from the USA

She's my little baby gonna rock and roll with her 
Just the way she love me I really got it hot for her 
I'm a going back, back to the USA

(instrumental)
