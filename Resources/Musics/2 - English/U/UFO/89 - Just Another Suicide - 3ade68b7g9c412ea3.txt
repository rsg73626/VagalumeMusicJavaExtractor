JUST ANOTHER SUICIDE

Just a bad situation 
Got me low, feelin' down I'm wonderin' why 
Caught me unawares 
No one knows and no one cares 
They put you down no matter how you try

* Put the words together 
Feelin' so strong 
I can't last forever I can't hold on, 
I can't hold on, no no

Somebody, someone is tearin' my whole inside 
Somebody, someone is takin' me for a ride 
Just a little bit of madness 
Do you no harm

** Another night, it's another shakedown 
Lookin' for a place to hide 
This could be your nervous breakdown 
It's just another suicide

Just a cold realization, gotta go I wanna turn and run away 
Got me in a spin, I'm gonna lose and never win 
They put you down no matter what you say

* Repeat

I can't hold on, no no

[INSTRUMENTAL]

** Repeat

[piano break]

Just a bad situation

I can feel it gettin' closer everyday 
Say I'm out of line [I'm takin' out of borrowed time] 
What's the use of tryin' anyway

* Repeat

Somebody, someone is takin' me for a ride 
Somebody, someone is tearin' my whole inside 
Just a little bit of madness 
Do you no harm

** Repeat

***Another suicide, another suicide 
Another suicide, another suicide 
Another suicide, another suicide
