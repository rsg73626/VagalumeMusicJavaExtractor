LONELY CITIES OF THE HEART

As the midnight fades in boys town
And the hustle stops to glow 
This urban landscape sprawls before me
And the hunger starts to grow 
But something more than my daddy showed to me 
How he wanted to make a man of me 
Living in the lonely cities of the heart 
Hiding in the shadows and searching in the dark

My mama reads me like an open book 
She knows when I'm up or down 
But every night I stay longer
In the creole part of town 
Something more than what the good lord gave to me 
Something more, much more than this
Living in the lonely cities of the heart 
Hiding in the shadows, searching in the dark

And it never stops, no it never stops, no one defends you now 
Living in the lonely cities of the heart

(instrumental)

I can take a little pain, but not tonight again

Outside my hotel window I hear the Mardi Gras 
Keep the candle burning bright Babe, i've come too far 
As daylight creeps through the curtains I start to slip away,
And everything that seems so certain is just another day

Living in the lonely cities of the heart 
Hiding in the shadows searching in the dark 
And it never stops, no it never stops, no one defends you now
Living in the lonely cities of the heart 
Hiding in the shadows searching in the dark 
And it never stops, no it never stops, no one defends you now 
Living in the lonely cities of the heart 
Living in the lonely cities of the heart...
