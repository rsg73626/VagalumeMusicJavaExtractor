FIGHTING MAN

Hearts of darkness
Falling down,
it's raining stones
Fate is driving
Now theres no meat
on the bone
There's a hurricane coming,
what a bitter pill
There's a distant drumming,
coming over the hill
She took everything,
got my jack in her hand
I was born so now
I'm just a fighting man,
A fighting man


Cold Wild Turkey
Drives a spike right through my brain
Bar room mothers
Waiting for the gravy train


It's a cold wind a blowing,
gone out of control
Time is a running,
touching my very soul
She took everything,
got my jack in her hand
I was born so now
I'm just a fighting man,
A fighting man


Solo


Ashes to ashes
trash is still trash
It's only a moment now
and we're gone in a flash


silver lining
Where's the man
with the master plan
Hearts of darkness
Spreading out
all across this land


There's a hurricane a'coming,
what a bitter pill
There's a distant drumming,
coming over the hill
She took everything,
got my jack in her hand
I was born so now
I'm just a fighting man,
A fighting man


She took everything,
got my jack in her hand
I was born so now
I'm just a fighting man,
A fighting man

Just a common man
Just a common man
