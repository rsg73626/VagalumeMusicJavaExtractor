SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO PAY

American beauty
came up and spoke
She touched her toes
and we shared a joke
Taxi's, limos,
power boat glides
Jet skies, mensa,
babes without a ride


You know the revolutions gone now
There's no revolution song
Somewhere down the line
You know on one of Gods good days
Can you hear me,
someone's gonna have to pay


Moonshot, rockets
nineteen sixties cool
Sonny Boy Williamson,
Pope John Paul
The Congo to Vietnam
The Beatles to the Stones
Is nobody left
who's gonna shake those bones?


You know the revolutions gone now
There's no revolution song
Somewhere down the line
You know on one of Gods good days
Can you hear me,
someone's gonna have to pay

Pay all the time


Solo


All of the misfits
all of the scars
All of life's promises
bottled in jars
There's a hum and a howl.
lovers on the run
Tell me what's on offer
from the government scum


Solo


Rats will get richer
and the dirt beg for more
Crumbs on the table
for the world of the poor
News of self worship
fresh from Hollywood
The pygmies of poison,
don't know bad from good


You know the revolutions gone now
There's no revolution song
Somewhere down the line
You know on one of Gods good days
Can you hear me,
someone's gonna have to pay

Oh that's pay all the time
someones got to pay

you ain't walkin'
you ain't talkin'
you got to pay

while i'm looking over your shoulder
you got to pay
