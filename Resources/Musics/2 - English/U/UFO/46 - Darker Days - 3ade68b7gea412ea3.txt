DARKER DAYS

Take me to the highway
Take me to heaven
I can feel Jesus, right in my bones

Looking for a high class up-market doorway
With no connections, no telephones

And I don't care what it's all about
I don't need to know

Walking on water
Walking on the mountain
I've got no whiskey running through my veins

They take me to the justice
And I wave old glory
There's no sentence for all these pains
Cause I don't care what it's all about
I don't need to know

*
Darker days surround me now I'm older
Longer nights freeze me it seems colder
Darker days they will take me under now
So help me please

Take me to the river, cleanse me with water
Because the good Lord has baptized me
I can't live like you good people
I'll bare my soul for the world to see

I don't care what it's all about
I don't need to know

Darker days surround me now I'm older
Longer nights freeze me it seems colder
Darker days they will take me under now

I don't think so
I don't know so
I keep falling down like little drops of rain
I don't know you
Tell me what's true
What is real, and what it is you call insane

Take me to the highway
Take me to heaven
I can feel Jesus, right in my bones
Looking for a high class up-market doorway
With no connections, no telephones

And I don't care what it's all about
I don't need to know

Repeat *

Oh yeah
Gotta help me please
