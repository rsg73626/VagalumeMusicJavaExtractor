HARD BEING ME

Hard Being Me

Can you hear me
We ain't about to quit boy
The bands back in town, alright
And you can all juice off

Show me a mountain, show me the top
Show me a woman that just can't stop
Hey baby set me free

Well I'm stuck down here in the cellar
I got shotgun in my hand
Somewhere my baby's going blind

And it's hard being me, Hard being me
I'm dizzy like a monkey on a tree
Hard being me It's hard being me
I'm a crazy man

I got wounds and cuts, Shining like dimes in my eyes
Somewhere my baby's going blind
Sometimes I wonder, Sometimes I confuse
Oh baby we can loose, Oh my baby's going blind

And it's hard being me, Hard being me
I'm dizzy like a monkey on a tree
Hard being me, hard being me
I'm shaking like a leaf
Shaking like a leaf on your monkey tree
