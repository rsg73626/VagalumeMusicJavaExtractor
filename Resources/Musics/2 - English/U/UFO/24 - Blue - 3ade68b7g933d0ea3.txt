BLUE

  


Blue, blue, oh baby where are you 
Blue, blue, tell me know, it's not true

There's nothing romantic in a tear-drawn goodbye 
Oh baby say it's a lie 
Panic sets in, I'm an irrational man 
If I can't have you nobody can

* Repeat

Last night, I heard you talkin 
Oh so close, whispering in my ear 
All night, till the morning I kept wishing I could feel you near 
When we stood naked at the 4th of July 
Moon shot took off, lit up the sky 
The Red Sea was parting for the second time 
The world at my feet, you were mine, it was..

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Lovin' you was so easy baby 
Holdin' on when our luck was down 
Sweetest thing that I ever, ever heard Was 
"I'll always, always be around"

Blue, blue, oh baby, where are you 
Blue, blue, gettin' desperate, desperate for you
