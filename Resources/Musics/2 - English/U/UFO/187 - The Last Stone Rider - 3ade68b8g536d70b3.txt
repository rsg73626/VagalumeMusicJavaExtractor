THE LAST STONE RIDER

Call my brothers
I will be there
Call my mother
To offer up a prayer

I hear the ricochet
Shot gun blast
We are the five
Before the mast

Down in the shallows
Like cool sugar cane
I want for nothing
Nothing to gain
She has the power
Of a mystical rod
She has a cross
We were on fire for God

I'm a last stone rider
And I wear this thorny crown
I have an English style of speaking
And I sleep where these boots come down

So love is called this dying breed
Estelle fills my every need
She's the last man standing
Solid as a rock
Dust and ashes
Breeding stock
I have a power
That is rare
I'll twirl my fingers
Round your honey hair

Round 'em up
Cut 'em down
I got my feet
On the ground
Hey, hey, alright

Fire me up
Come on
Fire me up now
Fire me up

I'm a last stone rider
And I wear this thorny crown
I have an English style of speaking
And I sleep where these boots come down
