SEA OF FAITH

Say sayonara darling
this time goodbye
No bon voyage,
it's time to fly
I can see the breakdown coming
Like a twisted wreck
Let's save ourselves the sorrow
Before we hit the deck


From the high plains
to the border
All across the land
From the flying of the flag
To lovers kissing hands


You can cover me in roses
put nickles on my eyes
There be no tomorrows,
no more goodbyes
Sea of faith
where did she go
Little diamonds
how you shine and glow
Looking at the future I don't know
I am just here to watch the river flow


A street full of whispers,
rings like a chinese gong
A room full of would be's
whose lives have gone wrong


The blues don't exist now
just to cleanse your soul
They were made to wake you up
Not to dig a hole


You can cover me in roses,
put nickles on my eyes
There be no tomorrows,
no more goodbyes
Sea of faith
where did she go
Little diamonds
how you shine and glow
Looking at the future I don't know
I am just here to watch the river flow


Solo


Say sayonara darling
this time goodbye
No bon voyage,
it's time to fly
I can see the breakdown coming
Like a twisted wreck
Let's save ourselves the sorrow
Before we hit the deck



It's something of a tragedy
It would make you weep
When you kiss your love goodnight
Now I see why lovers leap

You can cover me in roses,
put nickles on my eyes
There be no tomorrows,
no more goodbyes
Sea of faith
where did she go
Little diamonds
how you shine and glow
Looking at the future
I don't know
I am just here to watch
the river flow


Little diamonds
how you shine and glow
Looking at the future
I don't know
I am just here to watch
the river flow


Little diamonds
how you shine and glow
