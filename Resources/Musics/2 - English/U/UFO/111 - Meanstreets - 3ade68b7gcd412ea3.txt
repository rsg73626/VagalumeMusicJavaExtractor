MEANSTREETS

There's a heartbeat in the city
Caught in the rush there's no pity 
On the edge of day 
Late night traffic, late to go home 
I'm slippin out into the twilight zone 
I'm on the edge of day

* In a stolen moment two lovers meet 
Whisperin' promises they can't keep 
Across the bar jukebox plays 
Out in the night they steal away

** Out on the meanstreets, feel my heartbeat 
Each and every step I take 
Out on the meanstreets, feel my heartbeat 
It's in every move I make

With all the heat now, and all the stories 
Heroes wrestle for the chance of glory 
On the edge of day 
Midnight cowboys make the sweep 
There's nothing sacred on the street 
We're on the edge again

* Repeat 
** Repeat

When the lights go down you know life comes easy 
It's easy baby 
In the wild West End you can find 
A friend tonight
Oh tonight 
Got to keep this heart. inspired

* Repeat 
** Repeat twice then the instruments wrap it up
