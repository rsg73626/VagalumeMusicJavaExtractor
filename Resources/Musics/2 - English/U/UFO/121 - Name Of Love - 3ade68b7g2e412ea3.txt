NAME OF LOVE

Living in a one-room 
If I don't fall in love soon 
Hangin' on the telephone 
If I don't get your call soon

* Every night I spend alone 
I've never been so low 
And this room is closing in 
If I die, who will know

** In the name of love 
Is there someone left for me 
In the name of love 
Set this heart free

Dreaming of a playmate 
If I don't fall in love soon 
Strangers on a dark night 
But it's all over too soon

* Repeat 
** Repeat twice

[INSTRUMENTAL]

** Repeat twice
