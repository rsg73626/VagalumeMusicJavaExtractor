BLACK COLD COFFEE

Captain Midnight and Captain Cruise
Out on the ocean like a storm of bad news
It took three monkeys in a plastic mac
To fit inside a paper sack

And they're cooking up an alibi
Cooking up some steam
Out in the madness 
Somewhere in Orleans
They had a plan, they had a plot
Beggars and blues was all they got

Black cold coffee
Black Irish soup
Cold on a silver spoon
She's dancing through hoops

Baby's wishing on a wishing well
She's moving up and ringing her bell
Can't fly to heaven on a Persian rug
So put some coins in the old sailor mug

They travelled up together
From the coast
East of Aldgate
Silently like ghosts
They had a scam, they had a scheme
For drunks and bums counting beans

Black cold coffee
Black Irish soup
Cold on a silver spoon
She's dancing through hoops

Solo

Black cold coffee
Black Irish soup
Cold on a silver spoon
She's dancing through hoops
