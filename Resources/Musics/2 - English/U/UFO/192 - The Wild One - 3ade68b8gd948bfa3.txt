THE WILD ONE

We was going through a lifetime
I had a banshee on my back
We was down in Corpus Christie now
Picking up the slack

Now I was wondering where the wild boys
Had started off and gone
This memory's jamming buttons
Stuck on some old song

And if you get this message
Leave a sign or make a call
Mohammed's left his calling card
And it's written on the wall

Looking for the wild one, wild one
Looking for the wild one
Looking for the wild one
Looking for the wild one

She was gone in twenty seconds
Right before my eyes
No more honey kisses
No more long goodbyes

And I feel like pink nevada
Or cooler shade of blue
Mother earth is closer now
Walk me out in the morning dew

And if you get this message
Leave a sign or make a call
Mohammed's left his calling card
And it's written on the wall

Looking for the wild one, wild one
Looking for the wild one
Looking for the wild one
Looking for the wild one
Looking for the

Sometimes I stop breathing
Just to feel reborn
And it feels like rolling thunder
Blowing through the corn

Through my back pages
I can see the change
There's a storm a'coming now
Coming through the rain

And I'm out here drifitng
A million miles alone
Floating in a spaceship somewhere
Falling like a stone
Falling like a stone

Still looking for the wild one
Yeah yeah
