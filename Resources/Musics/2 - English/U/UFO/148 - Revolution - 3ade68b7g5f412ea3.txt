REVOLUTION

Love lies bleeding, from the east now to the west 
I'm waiting to put your loving to the test

* I need to know, I need to give 
I need to feel to breathe and live 
I'm cutting loose and I'm breaking out 
I'm goin' to leave you baby in no doubt 'cause

** This will be my own revolution 
With a burning flag held high 
I will make my own constitution 
Till the day I die

Sensations in every move that you ever make 
Revelations what you now give you can't take

* Repeat 
** Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

If hell is to give I'm wondering what I'm going to do 
And I just couldn't see, oh and how 
My feelings run hot and I just couldn't stop now

** Repeat 
** Repeat 
** Repeat 
Till the day I die, till the day I die, till the day I die....
