LOVE LOST LOVE

Saturday night, we're all on the lookout for some thrills
Try to catch the band's last song
Backstage pass really showin' out
Feel that's where I belong

Sittin' down with all the big stars at the bar
I really have a rock vocation
From monopedemania to schizophrenia
Rise to any situation

* Of old lost love, where will you go
When the show is over
Nobody wants to know

**

We need to feel

something that's real
'Cause you're losin' from the start
So be careful with your heart

--solo--

**

Repeat

Partners in the next bed and they're dancing cheek to cheek
Can't understand their highbrow conversation
Yes, you're pretty, who needs a pretty face
With a hot lips reputation

*

Repeat
