WORLD CRUISE

World Cruise

Oh come on baby one big please
Give me some lovin' before you leave
Lightning striking like a hammer blow
I'm starting to lose my inner glow

And Money don't come here anymore
Honey don't sing at my door
I got my leaving sticks and shoes
I'm gonna take me on a world cruise

Well I could be basking out in the sun
Or on a bench soaking life away
I might be painting a work of art
Or in the church of a sacred heart

And Money don't come here anymore
Honey don't sing at my door
I got my leaving sticks and shoes
I'm gonna take me on a world cruise

The jailers watch it keeps good time
This is the only place I call mine
And these boots are still on my feet
In God I trust and I shall meet

And Money don't come here anymore
Honey don't sing at my door
I got my leaving sticks and shoes
I'm gonna be on the midnight news
