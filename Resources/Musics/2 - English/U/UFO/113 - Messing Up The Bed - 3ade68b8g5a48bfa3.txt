MESSING UP THE BED

Don't bust up my heart, my home, now
Don't make me ill
Don't stay around now
No, don't you linger, don't waste my time
Don't block my light
Don't stay here another night
You're a waste of space and a waste of time
Get out of my house, get out of my mind
Get up! Hit the road! Get up you heavy load
Sick out of your head
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
Get up! Move it out!
Get up, you little lout
Sick out of your head
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
What have I done to deserve this?
Where did I go wrong?
Why did I stop instead of moving along?
Trouble with you is you don't listen anymore
Trouble with me is I don't care any more
It's all gone wrong in so little time
You can take whats yours, you can leave what's mine
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
I'm sick of you messing up the bed
