RUN BOY RUN

Hey Mr. Fanciful, Mr. Cheer
Who let you in now?
How'd you get here?
Mr. Cocksure, Mr. Changeface
First in the trough
And fix the race

It ain't enough, it ain't enough
You sure talk tough but you cut up rough
It ain't enough, it ain't enough
You sure talk tough but you cut up rough
So brother keep your back to the sun
I smell trouble, better run boy run
No jingle jangle, no beat on the drum
Coming for you, better run boy run

Here's Mr. Charming, oh Mr. Nice
Trusting you is like throwing the dice
So Mr. Junkie, oh Mrs. Tramp
Where'd you leave your moral stamp?

It ain't enough, it ain't enough
You sure talk tough but you cut up rough
It ain't enough, it ain't enough
You sure talk tough but you cut up rough
So brother keep your back to the sun
I smell trouble, better run boy run
No jingle jangle, no beat the drum
Coming for you, better run boy run

Hell will be your freezing sun
Here I am, better run boy run
No jingle jangle, no beat the drum
Coming for you, better run boy run
You gotta run boy run

I said, so brother keep your back to the sun
I smell trouble, better run boy run
No jingle jangle, no beat the drum
Coming for you, better run boy run
Oh brother don't bump and wail
Gonna be like a hellhound on your trail
No jingle jangle, no rattle the drum
Coming for you, better run boy run
