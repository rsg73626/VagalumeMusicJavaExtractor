TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT

I'm on my way home
To see my little angel
Trying to put the pieces back together
Well it's been so long
I'm feeling like a stranger
But they tell me a good thing lasts forever

* Who's to say we can't talk it over
'Cause in time I know
That we'll work it out
Give it one more chance
Before it's too late
Baby until the last goodbye
Take it or leave it or leave me alone
Baby one (more) little Sad reply
Take it or leave it or leave me alone
As time passed

by
A thousand miles of ocean
I put you out of sight
And out of mind girl
And before too long promises were broken
Seemed no matter how we tried

(Repeat*)
