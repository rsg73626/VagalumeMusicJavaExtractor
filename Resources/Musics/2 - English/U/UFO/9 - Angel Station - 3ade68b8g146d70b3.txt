ANGEL STATION

I spend twenty walking 80 years of talking
One year to lose you five of regret
Fear you are over
I took these boxes down on the grass
Sell myself away for once last glance
This don't come easy
Nothing comes for free
Angels station get in the way

Angel station I will catch him
Angel station is my final destination
Angel station I am coming home
This don't come easy
Nothing comes for free
I took these boxes down on the grass
Sell myself away for once last glance
Once I drank to you [?] fifty the talk

[?] what you got
This don't come easy
Nothing comes for free
Angels station get in the way
Angel station I will catch him
Angel station is my final destination
Angel station I am coming home

This don't come easy
Nothing comes for free
I am on a beach found a bottle
With a message in it mother you were beautiful
That was your only [?]
Coming from a paper with your name on top
My world is burning I can't make it stop
Take me back home

To be home again
Hold me in your arms baby [?] back again
This don't come easy
Nothing comes for free
Angels station get in the way
Angel station I will catch him
Angel station is my final destination

Angel station I am coming home
This don't come easy
Nothing comes for free
I took my [?] say goodbye to everything
I spend 20 years of walking 80 years of talking
One year to lose you five of regret
I am giving all away
