KING OF THE HILL

I'm in a world and nothing's real
I caught a life on a spinning wheel
These tinted glasses will amaze
I see the world through my lovely haze

Well I may forget my earthly roots
I wear the cloak of whatever suits
So here's one for you, the rest for me
I'm like a tick, a musical flea

Lord of the manor
Hey I'm laird of the vale
Boss of the mill
Well I'm king of the hill

He has a wife yo sing tong
Cantonese can't do no wrong
Yet my garden sings in harmony
Don't know how to spell misery

Lord of the manor
Yes I'm laird of the vale
Boss of the mill
Call me king of the hill

Lord of the manor
Laird of the vale
Boss of the mill
Well I am king of the hill

A prince among men
A purveyor of zen
One shallow pool
Call me mr. Wonderful
King of the hill
