HEAVEN'S GATE

As midnight draws its steely shades 
And the Boystown girls go on parade 
My tattoo she's a kiss away 
In the Creole town it's another day 
Tears of rage and tears of pain 
We're two lovers called 'em different ways 
No redemption no remorse 
But this love drives a deadly course

* I can't wait for you 
Heaven's gate won't wait 
I can't wait for you 
'Cause heaven's gate won't wait

So hold me close, don't let go 
With one last kiss, we'll never know 
What should have, could have, might have been 
We're just chasin' one more dream 
I can hear the Mardi Gras 
From my hotel window it seems to far 
As daylight creeps through the shades 
I can see the price we paid

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

* Repeat twice
