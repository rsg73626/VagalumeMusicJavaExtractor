WE BELONG TO THE NIGHT

Ruby darling's got a crazy walk 
The boys love her with that dirty, dirty talk 
Singles bar with the broken light 
Easy touch, a lady of the night

* Ruby darling I need you 
Cross my heart and promise to be true

** And you tell me that you can't change 
Your life's been set, prearranged 
Hold on tight 'til the morning light "cause 
We belong to the night

Well-known face in every door 
Street kids come and try to make a score 
Patrol car stopped talk for a while 
But they let you go with a warning and a smile

* Repeat 
** Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

** Repeat

Life goes on down the streets 
Contacts made where the gay boys come to meet 
Keep saying it's your last night 
Give up this life for me without a fight

* Repeat 
** Repeat twice
