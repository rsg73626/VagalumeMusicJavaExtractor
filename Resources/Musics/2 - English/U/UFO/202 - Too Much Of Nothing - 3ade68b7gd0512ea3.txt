TOO MUCH OF NOTHING

I really tried my hardest just to make you understand
(What) it feels like to a boy, when he don't feel like a man
But you gave me so much money
And you would not understand
I realize I hurt you, so I stay just as I am

*

But the whole world keeps on turnin'
Yes, the whole world keeps on turnin'
But the whole world keeps on turnin'
I just roll along

There's been one too many mornings
And one too many years
One of life's delinquents
who just can't take the pace
We found out the hard way
I hope you understand
That my life is just my habit
And I had an overdose

*

Repeat

I used to try, I used to try
Used to cry, oh I used to cry

--- solo ---

*

Repeat
