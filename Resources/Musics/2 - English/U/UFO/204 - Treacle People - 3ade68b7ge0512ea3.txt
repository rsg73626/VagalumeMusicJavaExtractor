TREACLE PEOPLE

I walked through this place, although it wasn't really there 
And when I reached the other side, thought I didn't really care 
I moved round a bit, and started seeing people 
And the people that I met, oh were all covered in treacle

everyone was laughing, everyone except for poor old me, 
so I tried to entertain them, oh but they were hard to please 
as time went by, oh backwards I walked 
Backwards I talked, and backwards I laughed...
