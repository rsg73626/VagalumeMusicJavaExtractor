A SELF MADE MAN

I've worked so hard, like Hyde on the chaos theory
I've found my madness quite complete
No sign of light or love divine intervention
While I was scoring on your street
I am the demon of your darkest thoughts
Wired to self destruct
A greedy, nasty, selfish little man
Who could never have or get too much

*
But if the very thought makes you shiver
I am just one of the many lost
And I will change the course of the river
And never stop to count the cost

**
But everythings light on a Sunday
The choir singing all in tune
But such a small congregation
Will someone send up the balloon

***
Oh I'm a self made man
The fruits of yes you can
Oh I'm a self made man
And I'll take what I can

Out of the darkness and into the light
See the army grow and grow
And like a storm, a reign of terror
This ill wind will blow and blow

Repeat *

I'll take great pride and pleasure in your misery
And delight in your living hell
There's no known act of human kindnes left
My very mother I would sell

I'm not uncouthed, but educated
Now isn't that a scary thing
And elected to a place of power
Your slavery will be my sting

Repeat *

Repeat **

Repeat *** twice
