CALL MY NAME

* I want you to call my name
I need to hear your voice again
You know I want you to call my name
Any time, there's no shame in our love

I met you watching the cars go by
You were there, every night, at the corner of Elm and Vine
And you had nothing to hide
For just a few bucks and you know it's a free ride

* Repeat

I picked you up for all the wrong reasons
You left home for Hollywood, where there's no break even
We had nothing to hide
You were just a few years on the wrong side

* Repeat

It's only love, I know, a real love
I know it's only love, and you showed me how
Gotta keep you now

[INSTRUMENTAL]

We had nothing to hide
You were just a few years on the wrong side

* Repeat
In our love...in our love...thre's no shame in our love...
