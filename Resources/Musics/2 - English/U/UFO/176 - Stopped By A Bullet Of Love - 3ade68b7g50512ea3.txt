STOPPED BY A BULLET OF LOVE

Love and the stranger
So very far from home
A kid was playing Little Wing
I sat drinking on my own

Love and danger
Oh, they walk hand in hand
Said she was an actress
Thought I was in a band

Stopped by a bullet
She's a pinball rolling round my head
She turned on a dime
Left me for dead
I found love for the very first time

Hey Arizona, I can feel your heat
And I never, loved a tattoo
The way that I love you

Hey Arizona, in the coolest, desert wind
Willie's singing "Whiskey River"
I let love walk in

*
Stopped by a bullet
She's a pinball rolling round my head
She turned on a dime
Left me for dead
I found love for the very first time
Loved for the very first time
I found love for the very first time
Love for the very first time

Hey little Joe
Is that your working name
Are you hiding something
Or is the truth a darker stain

Hey little Joe
I'm not another fan
The chorus line's a pickup
And I'm a one night stand

Repeat *
