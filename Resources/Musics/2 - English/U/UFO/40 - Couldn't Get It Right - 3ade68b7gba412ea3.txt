COULDN'T GET IT RIGHT

You wake up in the morning 
Look for a clue, something new 
Turn on the radio and it's as dead 
As the visions dying in your head 
And when you were young 
You had big ideas no hidden fears 
You had your heroes they were walkin' tall 
Now your devotion seems comical

So now you' got older 
And the world's got colder than it used to be 
Every day gets longer and turns into the darker night 
Down in the gutter nothing seems to matter 'cos you're history 
I couldn't get it, I couldn't get it right

You played the game as children 
Didn't understand life's not so grand 
Love hurts you and you could feel the lonely, lonely one 
Some people got it easy 
They got it made, so unafraid 
You'll be the fool and /fight/find/ the winner he's gonna take it all
