WHO'S FOOLING WHO?

Who's Fooling Who?

I see you every night we talk right through the doors
You don't love me anymore who's keeping score
And I don't want this situation getting out
We're living proof we're living in this doubt

Who, Who's the fool
Who, Who's the fool
Who, Who's cheating who

I'm ain't no difference baby now since we went alone
Come on home honey cos this ain't real
I've got the same face this ain't no steal

Who, Who's fooling who
Who, Who's cheating who

I ain't no angel but I am still here with you
Who, Who's fooling who

Who, Who's fooling who
Who, Who's cheating who

I ain't no angel but I am still here with you
Who, Who's fooling who
