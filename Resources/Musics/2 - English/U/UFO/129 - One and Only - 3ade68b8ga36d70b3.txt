ONE AND ONLY

Babe I wanna see you
Just to see your face
Wrap my arms around you darling
Feel your body race
The chemist is cooking
Cooking up a pie
Settle back my honey now
Daddy's touching the sky

This is something for my one and only
This is something for my sad and lonely
I can't bear this any more
Cos I've never been this lonely before
And it ain't over till it's over
And it ain't over yet, no, no, no, no

Baby you're shaking
In and out of my dreams
Slipping into something loose
Slipping out of jeans
A gunman from laredo
Is inside my house
He has on silver spurs
But he's silent as a mouse

This is something for my one and only
This is something for my sad and lonely
I can't bear this any more
Cos I've never been this lonely before
And it ain't over till it's over
And it ain't over yet, no, no, no, no

Babe I wanna see you
Just to see your face
Wrap my arms around you darling
Feel your body race

This is something for my one and only
This is something for my sad and lonely
I can't bear this any more
Cos I've never been this lonely before
And it ain't over till it's over
And it ain't over yet
And it ain't over till it's over
Oh no, no, baby you said it
