DREAM THE DREAM

Mama they say the snow this winter 
Beat you to the ground 
But I'm a long time gone, long time gone 
Wish I could see the blazin' sunset 
Falling right into the bay 
But I'm a long time gone, long time gone

* To dream the dream that's over 
To live and love again 
Oh my America 
And to be where my footsteps lead me over 
To be born again tonight

I want to be there on our back porch 
Looking on down the road 
But I'm a long time gone, long time gone 
The troubles here, they pass me by 
I want to get home to you 
But I'm a long time gone, long time gone

* Repeat

Lonely days, lonely nights 
Caught up in someone else's fight 
I'm holdin' on, and you're so strong 
All I want to be is just holdin' you tonight

[INSTRUMENTAL]

* Repeat

[Short instrumental] * Repeat and fade out
