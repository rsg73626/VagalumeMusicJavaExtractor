LOOKING OUT FOR NO. 1

Just a kid with a crazy dream wants it all before he's seventeen
Don't know where to begin
With a wild thought he knows the fact, no no there's no looking back
Just gotta stand up and make it real

How does it feel to be right out on your own
Just gotta keep looking out for #1

Some people make it and others don't try, they seem happy to live out a lie
I'm right here on my own
Me I'm a gambler and I pay for my sins, I've been right there and I'm back again
Just gotta stand up and make it real

How does it feel to be right out on your own
Just gotta keep looking out for #1

Let's get away right out of here, it's not soon enough for me
Breaks of a lifetime it's there like a lifeline, reach out and grab it it's free
