CHAINS CHAINS

Jack of Diamonds/ is a gambling man/ ["Together were men"] 
He played the tables /whenever he can/["While he can"] 
Take some advice boy stay clean stay out of his way 
Little Jeannie is a dancing queen 
/She's been/ ["She bounce 'n"] shaking it since she was sixteen 
Skips across the tables acting out her passion play

It wasn't for money, it's only a chance 
You take a gamble, got shot ["let's cut"] for romance 

Chains, chains pulling you down 
Chain of love that turns your world around 
Chains chains pulling you down 
Chain of love that turns your world around

Without a warning /Jeannie took off/ ["She took off"] one night 
Jack got so mean boy, he just had to fight 
He died on the floor someone else evens the score 
Back on the tables/ Jeannie's romance had died/ ["she's roaming tonight"] 
That one look of love that told her a lie 
And for her there's no waves crashing on seashores

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Chains chains...chains chains...
