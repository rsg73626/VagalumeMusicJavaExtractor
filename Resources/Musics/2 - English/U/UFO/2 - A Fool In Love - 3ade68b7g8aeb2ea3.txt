A FOOL IN LOVE

People say I'm a lion at heart 
But they don't know what I am 
People say that I stand apart 
But they just don't understand 

* Everynight when the darkness calls 
I'll be there at your beck and call
** I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool right now

People say I'm a man of means 
But my plans are full of holes 
People say I'm a holy child 
But I'm rich down to my soul 
All I need is you close beside me All I need is to satisfy

**Repeat
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool in love

Every mornin' when the sun comes up
And all your dreams, they slip away
I see your face and I understand
You're the only one, only one to make my day, yeah

Everybody say you ain't no good
But I won't believe it's true
They all say I ought to find someone,
but my heart belongs to you
* Repeat
** Repeat
** Repeat
