ROCK READY

Call me the king of memphis
You can call me the tupelo rose
This here guitar is singing now
Like the mississipi flows

It ain't about the money
It ain't about the fame
This is rock
There ain't no chain

You can put me down
You can help me up
I'm used to living on self made luck
I'm rock'n'roll ready
Behind the driving wheel
Tupelo on tennesse
No petticoats or thrills
I'm rock'n'roll ready
Behind the driving wheel
I cut my teeth on the old steel mill

The lights go up
The stage comes down
I'm undefeated
Who's gonna wear my crown
I'm going to hollywood to sell my vest
I'm gonna do what i do best

It ain't about the money
It ain't about the fame
This is rock
There ain't no chain

You can put me down
You can help me up
I'm used to living on self made luck
I'm rock'n'roll ready
Behind the driving wheel
Tupelo on tennesse
No petticoats or thrills
I'm rock'n'roll ready
Behind the driving wheel
Plays like an old saw mill
