BLINDED BY A LIE

I got the information from a friend last night
And it looks so very different in black and white
I was "part of the second party", that was me
Signed away my life, really couldn't see

* Blinded by, blinded by a lie
Blinded by, blinded by a lie

I know it's just the price you pay
I know you're nothing

* Repeat

Now you listen closely, don't you go away
There's a cut of something, in what I have to say
You keep the full deck from me, "Mr. Percent"
Through the legal jungle, who's the one that's bent?

* Repeat

I know it's just the price you pay
I know you've nothin' to say
And oh boy every dog has it's day
I know you'll be the one to pay

[INSTRUMENTAL]

And now I see that I was
* Repeat and fade
