SOME OTHER GUY

Some Other Guy

Some other guy, has taken my love away
Some other guy, better start learning how to pray

The world it just keeps turning
The midnight oil's still burning
And you're not coming home

The phone it just stopped ringing
There's no late night singing
What am I gonna do with this life

And the moon it's still waning
Up on the roof it's still raining
Oh it's a mess of the blues
And it ain't nothing but losing you

Some other guy, has taken my very heart and soul
Some other guy has dug a very big hole

The cat it just keeps whining
The dog it just keeps pining
Wasting away
The traffic lights still change
But Oh this house still feels so strange

And the moon it's still waning
Up on the roof it's still raining
But I'm a mess for you
I'm just a mess of the blues
Ain't nothing but losing you
Come on home honey

I should've seen it coming
Should've started running
When you changed your hair
Baby's got it coming
And there ain't no difference here
But the house is just the same
Oh darling you've gone away
Ain't nothing but the blues
That you've given me
Ain't nothing but the blues
You've given me
And it ain't nothing but losing you
