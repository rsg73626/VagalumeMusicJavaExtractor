WAVING GOOD BYE

You talk about your solutions
Talk about evolution
To all of life's problems

You talk about yourself a lot
Put another coin in the slot
To your master plan

I hear your music playing
I see your mad men praying
Whilst your tantrums raving
And all that crying around
Crying around

I'm waving goodbye
In the last chance saloon
I'm waving goodbye
I am in reds recovery room

You talked about intensity
You forgot about sensibility
That's you and me babe
You talked about your love life burning
It was quite stomach churning
To those who knew you best

You talked about your music playing
All I see is mad men praying
Whilst you have a tantrum baby
Your soul's not for saving
And that spotlight craving
Into the wilderness

I'm waving goodbye
In the last chance saloon
And I'm saying goodbye
Up in reds recovery room

I'm waving goodbye
In the last chance saloon
Waving goodbye
To everything, everything I ever knew
I'm saying goodbye
To our last big moon
Waving goodbye
In reds recovery room

Lost everything
But nothing was mine
And I am saying goodbye
For the very last time
