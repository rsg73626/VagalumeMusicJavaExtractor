SERENITY

Baby
we're not looking for eternity
So smile now
while you're looking for this serenity


He dosses out here in doorways
Caught between wars
Tells us something is coming
won't reveal more
She shuffles up close beside him
And kisses his ear
I guess all our time is running,
Running on fear


And it goes around,
round, around again
Like a magic circle
till it comes to the end


Baby
we're not looking for eternity
So smile now
while you're looking for serenity


Out from the marble palaces
kings and queens Will rejoice
their importance of being
Their importance of choice
And as they swung Mussolini
like a chime in the breeze
The pope blessed his children
in a sea of sleaze


And it comes around,
round, around again
Like a magic circle
till it comes to the end


Baby
we're not looking for eternity
So smile now
while you're looking for serenity


Solo



And It still flowers
in springtime
Dogs howl at the moon
Now the funeral is leaving
to the general's own tune
All the rich and the famous
don't know who I am
The jokers and the jugglers
Even the prince of Siam


And it goes around,
round and round again
Like a magic circle
till it comes to the end


Baby
we're not looking for eternity
yeah, yeah
So smile now
while you're looking for serenity
oh yeah


Baby
a little faith or charity
So smile now
while you're looking for serenity


oh Baby
we're not looking for eternity
Hey,hey yeah
So smile now
while you're looking for eternity
Hey,hey yeah yeah

Baby
a little faith or charity
