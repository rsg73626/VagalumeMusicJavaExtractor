SHOOT SHOOT

Was a fast tough woman
Loved to play the clown
You won't do nothin' about it
Break a good boy's resistance down

Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
She said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me

Convinced me that she was worth it
Never knew I was her kill
And two 45's would do the trick
And pay the bills

Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
And she said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for free

I've really got to get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now

Solo

Holding out in my hotel room
And the police they finally come
Had her as the prosecution,
And my prints upon the gun

Repeat
