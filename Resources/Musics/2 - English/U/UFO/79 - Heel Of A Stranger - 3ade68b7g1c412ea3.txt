HEEL OF A STRANGER

I was 17 and I thought you were one in a million 
I never dreamed anyone (would) ever take you away 
And at 21 tied the knot with a holy union 
But I never thought I'd live to regret that day 

* You put a scar on my heart I can't cover up and hide 
I'm on the ropes in the corner with no fighter left inside 
** Under the heel of a stranger he holds you captive by his charms 
I saw the signs but not the danger now he's the hero in your arms

Every night you go out tell me its with a friend 
You come back late know you've seen him again 
And at 29 I realize the dreaming has to end 
Although I've lost your love still the ghost remains

* Repeat
** Repeat 
Oh yeah,

(Instrumental break ) ** Repeat 2.75 more times
