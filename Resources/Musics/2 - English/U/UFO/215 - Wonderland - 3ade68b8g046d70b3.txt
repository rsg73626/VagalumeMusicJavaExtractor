WONDERLAND

Kill switch tic tac go room
My war will never end cause I am going to the moon
I am going to a wonderland you can come too
We can do whatever you want to now let me share a little something
We can stay young and keep this mother fucker bumping
But in time she might get jealous and in case you haven't notice
She is a little bit selfish see me and time we never get along
You say you are running and I wonder if you will find a home

I tell her stop you need to catch a breath
Don't rush you got a few years left
Me and time we were stuck and I wonder where
Everything was [?] till she came with another plan
She said I will never be shit but in wonderland I just say fuck it
Yes I am a fucking hero heating up the world when it gets to sub zero
We go anyway the wind blows [?] I am so out of space like I have been in a [?]
But I am doing major damage like a tortilla now that is imagination
I don't wanna grow up I better stay in vacation wonderland

Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can stay
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can play
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can stay
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can play

I am in my youth and I got a few years left
The way of carefree life call. When the flight left
Way to the left gone to the west
In my past memories I am always reminisce
Think about old days don't wanna get older
No way it's ok we can stay
Under landed play never thinking about our age
20 Ears old sounds strange to land out of adulthood
Is not my place where I would vacate if I had my way but
I am happy that I am here cause life gives and takes

So I am always living life like it was my last day
Got time [?] on my mind cause it passes away
I realize that life is too short to wait carpe diam
My mentality I cease the day find a conscious in my brain
When I meditate seconds minutes hours and days
Weeks months years and decades memories are lost in a no pay [?]
Every day is another day but anticipates
But in wonderland the time will never fly away
Wonderland where we can stay where we can play
I am staying young till I am old in my favorite place

Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can stay
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can play
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can stay
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can play

Got all this young I am too old to run
I heart it all the time juvenile the liquid minds
Never will I fall just take me to a place where music lives
Age is just a number I am hip hop and it always lives
My soldiers give it up just because I am getting old
Drop the man is hitting on they say I can't
I lose my eyes I am probably drifting into a place I call wonderland
Yes I can be a star and the sky is a shutting star
Living in logic [?] my minds everything in life
Give it a call and let it charge you like [?] my time

Is running out held on don't even try it
70s babies my old has start to riot
Wonderland is my place
Wonderland is my escape
My escape from the ghetto I am tired [?] like heavy metal
Got me riding my deepest thoughts is instrumental
Is my place of relaxation wonderland I just give away

Hoping everything is gonna be ok fly way evil spirits
Say [?] got a better plan I am flying [?]
Wonderland already pack my bag
Don't try to catch me cause you can't but
This youngsters need some guidance
Lead them to the path hip hop was so long mother fucker do the math
Cause I am splitting like I am moses of the land

Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can stay
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can play
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can stay
Wonderland my favorite place wonderland where we can play
