HIGHWAY LADY

Run down, low down, don't feel tired 
Take no orders, don't get fired
I waste away cruisin' along 

* Fighting blizzards, ragin' storms
Hold the wheels tight, know I'm born to ramble on
Cruisin' along
But I stop, turn my head around
Sleep until tomorrow, in my arms
In my arms,
Highway lady, Lorelei, dream the big time high above
Highway lady, high on wheels make you smile again
How she feels

Found my way to Spanish stairs
Small corruption, no one cares I taste a lie
Cruisin' along

* Repeat

* Repeat

How she feels
Highway lady, highway lady Highway lady, highway lady
