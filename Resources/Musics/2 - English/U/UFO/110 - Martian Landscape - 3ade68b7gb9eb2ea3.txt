MARTIAN LANDSCAPE

* Come from the land where
the wheat is still wheat
Where the waters in the rivers is still water
In this land every man lends
a hand when you need it
But your hands are full of life
So you can help yourself and feel it

It's been a long way from the red of my home
From the valleys
and the green plains never ending 
Everyone knows that the sun in his land is stronger
And your hands are full of life
If you can only wait just longer

** So let it be a small haven big in your heart
Don't let it turn into a nova
Tryin' to climb and climb
Try and forget this place where
I can still find time
To sing in rhyme

.*** Martian landscape,
I'll learn to lie in your arms
Where all the freedom is mine and it comes
Martian landscape,
I'll turn my face to your sun
Where your horizon is mine and it comes

* Repeat
** Repeat
*** Repeat

Martian landscape
Martian landscape
