OH MY

Well, I'm struttin' up and down
Tryin' to get my face in town
Wonderin' the hang where
to turn each time around
Look in your mirror just to see my face
Two way time, baby, it's no disgrace
Oh my, how the times have changed
Oh my, how the times have changed

Ladies used to dancin' but I move for real
Lookin' for reaction, something you can feel
When ya dance,
I move and they look me in the eye
Two way time, baby, it's no lie 
*Oh my, how the times have changed 
Oh my, how the times have changed

*Repeat
*Repeat
