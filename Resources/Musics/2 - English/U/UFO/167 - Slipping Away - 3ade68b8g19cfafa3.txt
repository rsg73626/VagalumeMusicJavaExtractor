SLIPPING AWAY

All the world knows
Yet none know well
To shun the heaven
That lead men to this hell

If all the stars
Disappear and die
And I am looking at an empty sky
Oh I'll be damned
Back behind the sun
This kind of love
Can't be bought or won.

And when every second counts
When the minutes
turn a night into a day
Because the closer you get
The further you slip away
Because the closer you get
The further love slip on away

When the summer rain came
Well it kissed our feet
And a magic moon lay down on our street
Oh love and death
It's like war and peace
One single outreach
On this empty beach
Cos you're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
Want her to stay oh hey, hey
Because the closer you get
The further you slip away
Cos the closer you get
The further love slip on away,
Slipped away
Ooh na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Slipping away, slipping away

These plastic bags and these crushed up cans
This twisted wreck on some foreign land
Better hold close what you hold so dear
Cos the vanishing point is coming oh so near
All this world knows
Yet none know well
To shun this heaven
That lead men to this hell
The closer you get
The further you slip away
I said now, the closer you get
The further love slips away, slips away, slips away
The closer you get, the further you slip on away
Cos the closer you get, the further love slips onaway,
Slipping away
