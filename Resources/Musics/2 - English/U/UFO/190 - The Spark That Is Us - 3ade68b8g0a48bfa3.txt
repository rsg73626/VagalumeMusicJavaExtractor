THE SPARK THAT IS US

One more time said the Lady Jane
Walk on in the fire
Chinese whispers ringing now
Step into the mire
I've been strung out to dry
Blowing in the gale
My name's been left hanging
Hanging on your nail
All the misfits
Are flying like a kite
All of my friends
Have come to see the fight
Oh oh, the spark that is us
This love has never gone away
Oh oh, the spark that is us
I hold a moment every single day

I can hear the choirboys singing
And it's falling on my ears
I can hear the trumpets playing
Running down the years
Don't ask me how the world looks
How it looks tonight
I'm gonna be leaving babe
Outta here and outta sight

I've been laying down
Coming off the rails
I've been chasing shadows
playing happy trails

Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us
This love has never gone away
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us
I hold a moment every single day

Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us
This love has never gone away
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us
I hold a moment every single day

Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us
This love has never gone away
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us
I hold a moment every single day
