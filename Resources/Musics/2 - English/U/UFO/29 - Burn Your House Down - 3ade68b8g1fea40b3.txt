BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN

There's a sunset close behind
There's a blue light
Calling me
Trouble of the heart tonight
I'm so blinded
I can't see

I will burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drown

The could've been and wannaabes
Rubbing shoulders with the gang

The failures and new pretenders
Longing to be heard
And shout out loud

I will burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drown

Sometimes I take out this gun
Alone on ocean boulevard
I put it in my mouth
And play out my final card

Here it comes and I don? t know
The feeling's gone and I want it so
In this life I am caught in time
Trapped between that dividing line

I will burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drown

I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn
I want to burn your house down
Sit right here and watch you drawn

I'm gonna burn your house down
I'm burn you hold down, hey
