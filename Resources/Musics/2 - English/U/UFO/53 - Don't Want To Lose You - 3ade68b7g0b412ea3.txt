DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU

Is she waiting now
Do you think she really really cares
Is she standing and looking with her hope
Her fingers through her hair

Looking at the future you and me baby
Life lately don't seem like wonderland
Nothing here nothing coming in
Money goes like a wino's gin
Slips through my hands

* (And) I know it ain't easy
I get drunk like a fool
There's a promise I made you darling now
Just one golden rule

** Hold on to this love
'Cos I don't want to lose you
Hold on to this love
'Cos I don't want to lose you

When the lights go down
Do you think she really really cares
As she's lying there with her arms around you
A strange affair

Looking at the lights on Lakeshore Drive
In the Windy City now
Will our love stay alive
Last night I held you in my arms
You looked and said "Baby, we will survive"

And I know it ain't easy
'Cos life gets so cruel
And there's a promise I made you darling now
Just one golden rule

** Repeat
** Repeat
* Repeat

Where you gonna go, who you gonna run to
Who you gonna see tonight babe
What you gonna wear, who you gonna know
Who you gonna see tonight my baby
From the back of a one dollar down
Did you ever think I wouldn't be around
This ain't a stand off ain't no fight
But where you gonna be sleeping tonight?

** Repeat
** Repeat and fade out
