SHADOW DANCER

I am back in the circus
oh hustling days
I look at the world
in a rose coloured haze
Cramp tight bodies
jive and girate
Bump and grind to the rhythm of fate
And we spun in the sunlight
Of our long summers day
We kissed the heavens now
It's still a beautiful day


Back on my wall
shadow dancer
My hammer headed friends
and the puppet girls call
Back on my wall
shadow dancer
The dance is coming back,
back in my world


Married a model
from old Hong Kong
Came to England
just a singing my song
This love in a letter
sure didn't last
Stamped her passport
never saw her arse


And we spun in the sunlight
Of our long summers day
We kissed the heavens now
It's still a beautiful day


Back on my wall
shadow dancer
My hammer headed friends
and the puppet girls call
Back on my wall
shadow dancer
The dance is coming back,
back in my world

Solo

Unlucky in life,
unlucky in love
No special blessing from above
Fools and horses
come to my door
I am the stranger
who sleeps on the floor


we spun in the sunlight
Of our long summers day
We kissed the heavens now
It's still a beautiful day


Back on my wall
shadow dancer
My hammer headed friends
and the puppet girls call
Back on my wall
shadow dancer
The dance is coming back,
back in my world


Back on my wall
shadow dancer
My hammer headed friends
and the puppet girls call
Back on my wall
shadow dancer
The dance is coming back,
back in my world
