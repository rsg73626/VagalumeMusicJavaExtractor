YEAR OF THE GUN

Here we come
I got that

I got the smell of whisky
And leather cadillacs
Got a mother running
With a real tight rack

No winners here
Only powered lead
Brain dead boy
With a nail in his head

Year of the gun now
Year of the gun now

There's no mercy under the miracle bell
Glamour and glitz
God's fiery hell
Beyond the belly
Heaven can't move
In the night time rush
That bubbles and brews

Those saintly sinners here
Who say their prayers
There's all the riches
For he that dares

And the ghostly sceptre
Of life's lost and found
I'll meet you buried 6 feet
Under the ground

Revenge is sipped
Like cold chicken soup
You're in you're out boy
How do you figure in this loop

Year of the gun now
Climbing up a mountain

Jimmy boy now
He looks so cute
He's packing like a mule
In his killing suit

Year of the gun now
Year of the gun now

I stopped breathing at 2: 45
Ambulance came
Said I was still alive
Cut'em down young
In some bloody hail

The track line ends
With a silver rail
And the saintly sinners
Who say their prayers
There's all riches here
For he that dares

But the ghostly sceptre
Of life's lost and found
I'll meet you buried
6 Feet underground

Year of the gun
Give me a smile now
Year of the gun

Year of the gun babe
Year of the gun now
Give me a smile now
Year of the gun now
Year of the gun now
Here a gun now
