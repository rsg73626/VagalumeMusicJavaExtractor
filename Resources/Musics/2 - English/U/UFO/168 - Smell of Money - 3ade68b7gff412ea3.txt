SMELL OF MONEY

(intro)
One more day, with a tumble fall,
Down the money pit, with nothing to show
Hey hey yeah
Another twist, in the horror tale
It's an open coffin, that needs one more nail
Smell of money

Maybe I'm a victim, (Soft silk and bamboo?)
Maybe it's the smell of money
Attracts me to you...
Hey hey yeah money

Two clean shirts
I'm out on bail
As the barroom baits
They start to wail
The smell of money

Maybe I'm a victim, (Soft silk and bamboo?)
Maybe it's the smell of money,
that brings me to you

Stretched out across the ceiling
?? Domes shimmer and glow
Golden citadels
While the autumn wind billows and flows

(instrumental)

Dancing nights, in the lost and found
Move really nice to that money sound

Smell of money, smell of money,
smell of money, smell of money
I need
I bleed 
(sudden stop)
