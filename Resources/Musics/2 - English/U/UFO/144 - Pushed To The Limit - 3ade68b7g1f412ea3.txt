PUSHED TO THE LIMIT

Put your feet up maybe let the world pass by
Keep off the street, go away and wait to die
What you don't see is what life means to me
My woman says it ain't right
For a man my age to fight
She don't get it
She ain't in it
I'm pushed to the limit

Two clean shirts, I'm puffing on an old cigar
I still love women, sex and fancy cars
What you don't conceive is just what I believe
My doctor says it ain't right
For a man my age to fight
He don't get it
he ain't in it
I'm pushed to the limit

Is it nice and cozy, sitting there in your evening chair
Is your paper pressed like your string vest
It's enough to make you rip out your hair

Relations sit and wring their hands
How long will I survive
Here's the cherry, there's more spunk left
Kiss my arse, I'm still alive

You keep it nice and quiet boy, but please don't pacify me
I'm just not ready for the shade of an old oak tree
What you don't see is what life means to me
And my dad's an angry man, sometimes like Desperate Dan
And he gets it
And he's in it
He's pushed to the limit

My doctor says it ain't right
For a man my age to fight
He says put out the light
He don't get it
He ain't in it
I'm pushed to the limit
