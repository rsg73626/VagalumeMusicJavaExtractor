CALL ME

She looked for truth inside a bottle of rain
Posted an ad then changed her name
On a roller coaster that just couldn't be caught
She left one note at the hotel last resort

And it said
Call me, don't let me down
Walk me on the water
Don't let me drown - no
Call me, don't let me down
Walk me on the water
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown

Well the precious friends and their special needs
They're like a cancer that just feeds and feeds
Saddle up and let's get out of here
You don't need one more to shed one more tear
You couldn't make a stand now
You couldn't get it right
I only got this message now
Late, late last night

Call me, don't let me down
Walk me on the water
Don't let me drown - no
Call me, don't let me down
Walk me on the water
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown

Call me

Call me, don't let me down
Walk me on the water
Don't let me drown - no
Call me, don't let me down
Walk me on the water
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
