IT'S KILLING ME

Living inside a bottle 
Strung out on a line 
Caught in life's rough and tumble 
Blind leading the blind 
I wish there was an answer 
But she's got such an easy way 
And you know you can't leave her 
And you know you can stay

* Oh it's killing me 
Oh, love's a mystery 
Oh, it's killing me 
Oh, love's a mystery

We're hiding from the small talk 
And hiding all the pain 
With our backs against the wall 
Is all this love in vain

* Repeat

When I'm with you you know I try so hard 
Not to love you but I keep up my guard 
Every single day that goes by 
Are we fooling ourselves living a lie

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Please tell me now it's no secret 
Is this surrender with defeat

Do you let love pass you by 
Walk to a different beat

* Repeat
