TERRI

Terri every time we talk we just disagree 
Every chance we had is passing by 
The simple things you say all drift away into the night 
So don't let me know what I can't see

* Terri is it over again 
Lost in love 
Everybody laughing at me 
With eyes like a child 
You smile when you hit the tide 
Holding me captive 
For the world to see

Every now and then I'd see that wild look in your eyes 
It's in all the long shots that we tried 
We used to hold on tight, run for the night 
How far we'd go we couldn't see

* Repeat

Every day goes by we get further and further away 
Conversations end with nothing much to say 
Maybe we've made a mistake it's too late we'll never know 
We can't change it girl 'cause I just have to go

[INSTRUMENTAL]

* Repeat

On these lonely nights I reach out for your love 
This empty room feels cold and bare 
Then I'll try the phone and swallow my pride 
It's no good we've tried and tried

* Repeat
