ROCK BOTTOM

Seventeen and a nature's queen ya, You know what I mean
Twenty one, alone one, and you can see the numbers run
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep
With the wings of god above you, Before the spirits meet

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

Shadow earth is closin' in above the, lamps in your street 
Lucifer goes walkin', down for you to meet 
Minutes pass so slowly by the, hands on your clock
Heaven's door just don't open when, you can knock

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

With the darkness closin' in
Will the light reveal your soul
Just one sweet kiss on your clay cold lips
Death' long sleep you'll never know
Where do we go, where do we go
Where do we go from here

Solo

Seventeen and a nature's queen ya, you know what I mean
Twenty one, alone one, you can, see the numbers run
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep
With the wings of god above you, before the spirits meet

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
