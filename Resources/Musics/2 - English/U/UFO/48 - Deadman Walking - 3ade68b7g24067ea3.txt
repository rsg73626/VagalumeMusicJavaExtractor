DEADMAN WALKING

The enemy is at the door
The enemy within.
Dressed up in the strangest clothes,
Smells of drinking Bombay gin.


There's a deadman walking
And his shadow's growing long.
There's a deadman walking
Taking it in
before his time is gone.


My father was a Russian Jew
My Irish mother crazy.
I see summer, winter, fall.
When grown men
cry like babies.


There's a deadman walking
And his shadow's growing long.
There's a deadman walking
Taking it in
before his time is gone.


Solo


Wish I never had to leave.
Wish I'd never known.
Wish I could stay here forever.
Watch my garden grow.


There's a deadman walking
And his shadow's growing long.
There's a deadman walking
Taking it in
before his time is gone.


There's a deadman talking
And his shadow's growing long.
There's a deadman talking
Taking it in
before his time is gone.

There's a deadman walking
deadman walking
deadman talking
