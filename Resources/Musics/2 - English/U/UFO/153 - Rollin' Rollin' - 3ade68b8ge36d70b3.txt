ROLLIN' ROLLIN'

I was a high roller, tightly wound
Never missed a beat, never had my feet on the ground
All the ley lines criss cross my floor
The glittering prize beyond my door
So look through my window
Disrupt my sleep
This addictional coma
I'm counting black sheep

I said no, no, no, no
We ain't gonna let you go
I made you a promise
It's one I can't keep
We keep on rollin' rollin'
Rollin' down, rollin' baby right through your town
Rollin' rollin'
Rollin' down, rollin' baby right through your town

All the dry drunks gnash and wail
They all have such a scintillating tale
It's a cold wind blows through the pines
Up from the coast to the death valley line
I see the tempest
The whorey storm
Burning my eyes
Like galvanised porn

No, no, no, no
We ain't gonna let you go
I made you a promise
It's one I can't keep
Cos I'm rollin' rollin'
Rollin' down, rollin' baby right through your town
Rollin' rollin'
Rollin' down, rollin' baby right through your town

I made you a promise
It's one I can't keep
Cos I'm rollin' rollin'
Rollin' down, rollin' baby right through your town
Rollin' rollin'
Rollin' down, rollin' baby right through your town
