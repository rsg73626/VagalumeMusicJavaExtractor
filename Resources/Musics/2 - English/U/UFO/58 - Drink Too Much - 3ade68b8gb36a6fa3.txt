DRINK TOO MUCH

Drink Too Much

I guess that we've been here before
I still have my feet on the floor
This long evening's cold and bare
Don't we look just a funny pair

And you pull a spell on my heart honey
And there's nothing I can do about it
Cos I love you

Did I drink too much
Did we laugh too much
Did I make you cry
Does it hurt too much
Did we hold too much
I'm gonna love you till the day I die

If I don't come through it honey
Just let it go right

Our shadows dancing across the floor
I never wished for, never wanted more
Your diamond smiles and long black hair
You're much more baby than I ever dared

And if this whole world goes crazy darlin'
There's so much in my heart
And I'll love you today babe

Did I drink too much
Did we laugh too much
Did I make you cry
Does it hurt too much
Did we hold too much
Did we do it darlin' till the day we die
Holding on
Holding on now

Did I drink too much
Did we laugh too much
Did I make you cry
Does it hurt too much
Did we hold too much
I'm gonna love you till the day I die

I guess that we've been here before
Oh baby now I think we know the score
