RUNNING UP THE HIGHWAY

Quit my job at the 7-11
3-D vision and a glance of heaven
Picked up my six string began to play
Just one touch and it started to say

All your dreams will come true
Lovely mansion with a pool so blue
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life

* Running up the highway looking for something
Looking for something I can't see
Running up the highway looking for something
Looking for something I can't see

A thousand motels waiting to trash
TV dinners, well I love that bash
And if you Eddie, just say Hi
This party's open so drop on by

All your dreams will come true
A sunny haven from the Inland Revenue
Hot nights in Paris a chance to dance
Since I signed up I've been living in a trance

* Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

I'm feeling sick like Dawn of the Dead
I've got Marines marching through my head
John-Boy Walton, he's so nice
So come in this must be paradise

All your dreams will come true
That lovely mansion with its pool so blue
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life

* Repeat
