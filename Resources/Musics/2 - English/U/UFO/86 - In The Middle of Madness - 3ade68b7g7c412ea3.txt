IN THE MIDDLE OF MADNESS

(instrumental intro)

Don't you really love her, don't you really care
You've been looking forever, how did she get you there

In the middle of madness, when all has gone
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes Babylon

Isn't she so pretty, isn't she so fine
Haven't you been blessed to hold her all the time

In the middle of madness, when all has gone
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes Babylon

(can't figure out this part)

(instrumental)

Have you found a heaven, try to see the worth,
Looking at the future, she's right here on earth

In the middle of madness, when all has gone
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes Babylon

In the middle of madness, when all has gone
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes Babylon
(fade out)
