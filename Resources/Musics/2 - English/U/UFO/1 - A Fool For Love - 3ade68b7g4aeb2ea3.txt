A FOOL FOR LOVE

She told me her story, hoped I would understand
And I listened closely, as anybody can
But there's a distant look that's in her eyes
And as the nights grow longer, alone in bed she cries

My baby met a man on her first date
He stole her heart an' sealed her fate
And she thought she'd found a friend for life
He wanted her but not to be a wife

* La la li, la la li
A fool for love never wonders why
La la li, la la li
She hangs on in but it's just another goodbye

** (Now) every day is like another day
She lets it all drift on away
An' every man is like another man
They come and go but she never can

And from sixteen to thirty-two
She lost her loves and her good looks too
It's so sad to see at first hand
From a teenage beauty to a one night stand

* Repeat
** Repeat twice

[INSTRUMENTAL]

** Repeat and fade
