THE CHASE

Imagination's running wild
I'm a man, not a child
Can't seem to make something of my life
Here I go again, down, down, down
So you want to be someone
But my love, you just don't know

I'm chasing, but some man's making
It's just bringing me down, no no no
I'm chasing, some man's making
It's just bringing me down

In conversations, about who you are
The way you talk, boy, you're the star
Can't seem to make something of my life
Here I go again, down, down, down,
So you want to be someone
But my love, it just don't run

I'm chasing, some man's making
It's just bringing me down, no no no
I'm chasing, some man's making
It's just bringing me down
I'm chasing, some man's making
It's just bringing me down, 
I'm chasing, but some man's making
It's just bringing me down 

(instrumental)

I'm chasing, but some man's making
It's just bringing me down, no no no
I'm chasing, but some man's making
It's just bringing me down down down down
I'm chasing, but some man's making
It's just bringing me down, 
I'm chasing, but some man's making
It's just bringing me down down down

(more instrumental)
