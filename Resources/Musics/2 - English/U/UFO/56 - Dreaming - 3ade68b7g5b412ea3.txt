DREAMING

Kids are cruising on the old shoreline 
Goodbye-girls killing time 
Feel like soldiers we couldn't wait 
Running wild, rushing to our fate

* We kept dreaming, Kids are dreaming

Sleeping rough out on Brighton's beach 
A step from the law just out of reach

** We kept dreaming, Dreaming me and you

*** Got a plan we couldn't blow 
Nobody cares, nobody knows 
Made a stand and played a show 
Nobody cares, nobody knows

Hiding in the wrecks of burned out cars 
Found a compass on the promenade 
Gangs assemble in the old arcade 
By looking cool we thought we had it made

* Repeat

We ran wildly against the tide 
Nothing much just our teenage pride

** Repeat *** 

Repeat

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Down the alleys to the old stage door 
They heard the band coming through the floor 
Eric Burdon and the Animals played 
In our minds the impression's made

** Repeat 

*** Repeat and fade mixing ** and ***
