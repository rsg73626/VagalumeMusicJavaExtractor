WHO DO YOU LOVE

Oooooooo who do you love, who, who do, who,

I've a little girl and she's so fine, no doubt about it she's all mine 
She's the best girl i've ever had, she looks so good she makes me feel sad 
Who do you love, who do you love 
She gimme kisses every night she gonna make me feel all right 
When i ask her what she wanna do she said to me what you wanna do 
Who do you love, who do you love, who do you love, who do you love...

(instrumental)

I'm gonna make you feel all right i'm gonna let you stay all night 
I just wanna make love to you 
Who do you who do you

Hey, ... Who do you love

I've a little girl and she's so fine no doubt about it she's all mine 
Before i ask her what she wanna do she said to me
