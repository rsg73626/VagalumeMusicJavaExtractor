DEVIL'S IN THE DETAIL

We had great expectations
We had a lavender sea
We had cause and the potions
Prince of the city, king of the keys

The devil's in the detail
Your secret's safe with me
The devil's in the detail
And we're all out to sea
The devil's in the detail
We're at the watershed
The devil's in the detail
Sleeping in my bed
The devil's in the detail
Weaved within the cloth
The devil's in the detail
He's out collecting moths

The gates of babylon opened
We fell upon our prey
Everything was taken
It was the summer of our day
Come here my skanky toady
Let me whisper in your ear
If you think you're fooling anyone
Baby it's not very clear

The devil's in the detail
Your secret's safe with me
The devil's in the detail
And we're all out to sea
The devil's in the detail
Underneath the stone
The devil's in the detail
Chewing on the bone
The devil's in the detail
We're at the watershed
The devil's in the detail
She's sleeping in my bed

The devil's in the detail
We're at the watershed
The devil's in the detail
Now she's sleeping in my bed
The devil's in the detail
Underneath the stone
The devil's in the detail
It's chewing on the bone

The devil's in the detail, the devil's in the detail
Your secret's safe, your secret's safe with me
