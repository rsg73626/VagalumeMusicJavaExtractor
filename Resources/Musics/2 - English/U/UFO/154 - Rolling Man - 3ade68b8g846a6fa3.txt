ROLLING MAN

Rolling Man

I got the whole damn world wants to shake my hand
I got a map of the promised land
I got a woman with a magic touch
She's half crazy, she's half dutch

Come on Come on, What you got to lose
Come on Come on, Take a walk in my shoes
There's a neck of brandy under the bed
Fifteen children that won't get fed

Come on Come on, I'm a deadbeat hand
I got lightning seeds in my pants
I'm the kind of guy that needs to dance

I'm a rollin' man
