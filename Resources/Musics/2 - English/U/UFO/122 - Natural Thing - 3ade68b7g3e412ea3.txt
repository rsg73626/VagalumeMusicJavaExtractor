NATURAL THING

Said she came from Memphis
You can look but please don't touch 
Didn't like rock and rollers
Seemed a bit much too much 

* Cause it's the natural thing you feel at the start 
Natural blood starts to flow
Yeah, the natural thing, you get at the start 
Then she'll never let you go
Hey girl, now does it feel alright Think I'm gettin' through
Don't you think the band's real tight Wait til we start to move 

** May sound funny but you gave it to me 
I didn't even like it
May sound funny but you gave it to me 
And now I got to live without it

I been down to Atlanta
Got to move my feet
Gettin' down for the last encore
With every star she meets

* Repeat
** Repeat
** Repeat

Why'd you do it, why'd you do it
