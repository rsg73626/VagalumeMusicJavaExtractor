SUGAR CANE

Riding high up on Black Horn Ridge
Crossing over the Tallahatchie Bridge
Pour me a trigger nail of sparkling kind
This road is gnarly and it's weather lined

Fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
My sugar cane
I said fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain

I saw the badlands in the mirror light
I saw my lover run as she took flight
If I could get home just on time
Before some sucker tries to take what's mine

I said fall, it's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
My sugar cane
I said fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
She's my sugar cane

I do righteous now outside the law
I've got something worth fighting for
Give me a kiss now one last time
I'll send you spinning like a capital crime
I cut you slack with your fancy walk
I give you space with your fancy talk
What I won't do is give up to you
I got something special that you never knew

Fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
Sugar cane
Fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
Oh sugar cane

I said fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
My sugar cane
I said fall, she's the colour of rain
Kiss away my pain
Never again

Kiss away my pain
