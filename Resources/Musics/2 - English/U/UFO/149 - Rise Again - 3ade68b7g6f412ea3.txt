RISE AGAIN

(instrumental intro)
Going to Jamaica,
Warm and coral waters flow
There she goes
Sun kissed her body, in this magic feel love grow,
Love grows
Feel like letting go

Hey Mr. Saturday night
?? Right out the hole
It stops in a minute,
It's right down in it
Hey, we're really back on a roll

I don't know why, I don't know why
Feel so good I could die, I could die
Great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth, on a wish and a prayer
With a head full of hammers, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna rise again

Dream time (Lavinia??),
Even though the odds are stacked, she's coming back
(moon monkeys barking?) In a bitter chocolate glow,
There she goes, feel like letting go...

Hey, Mr. Cool jazz nights, let the fever go, 
It stops in a minute, I'm down in it
Hey, play it long and slow
I don't know why, I don't know why,
Feels so good I could die, I could die,
With a great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a prayer
With a head full of hammers, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna rise again

(instrumental)
With a great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a prayer
With a head full of hammers both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna rise again
I've been stricken, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a prayer, and I'm
Not going down, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna rise again.

Dream time (Lavinia??)
Feel like letting go.
(end!)
