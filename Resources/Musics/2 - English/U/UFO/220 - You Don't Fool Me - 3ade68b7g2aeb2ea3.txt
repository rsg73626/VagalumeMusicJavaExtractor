YOU DON'T FOOL ME

If I could see you would you still give me
Just hold me tighter and love me maybe
You'll be my thunder, I don't want saving
You don't fool me, oh no you don't fool me
One look at you it's easy to see
oh no you don't fool me, oh babe you don't fool me
I'll play along, just give it to me

You build me up now, you pull me down
You make me come on yeah, keep me around
I'll want to move you, I surely could
You don't fool me, oh no you don't fool me,
one look at you, it's easy to see oh no
you don't fool me, oh babe you don't fool me,
I'll play along, just give it to me

---instrumental---

Just gotta have you, you drive me crazy, tell me you feel it, your honey give me ...
Here burns the fire, I feel your heat
You don't fool me, oh babe you don't fool me
One look at you, it's easy to see
Oh no you don't fool me, oh babe you don't fool me
I'll play along, just give it to me
Oh no you don't fool me, oh babe you don't fool me
One look at you girl, it's easy to see
Oh no you don't fool me, oh babe you don't fool me
I'll play along, just give it to me
