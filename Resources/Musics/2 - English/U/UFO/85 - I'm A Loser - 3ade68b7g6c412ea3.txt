I'M A LOSER

Last train's eleven, it's now quarter past 
Why're you tryin' to make the evenin' move so fast 
I'm in real trouble but I can't go back home 
They locked the doors and I'm left out alone 

* You can come to my place and sleep on the couch
Lots of people do it and we won't leave you out
Hard times out on the Street
Hard times, hard to beat

** The painted lies they all hand you
I'm a loser on the road
I'm a loser on the road, yeah

Euston station and it's cold as ice
AlI night specials, they move you on
But me and Ginger over there
We got this thing where we really take care

* Repeat
** Repeat

I'm a loser, I'm a loser
I'm a loser
