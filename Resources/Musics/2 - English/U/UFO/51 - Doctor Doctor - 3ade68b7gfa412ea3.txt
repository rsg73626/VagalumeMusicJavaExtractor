DOCTOR DOCTOR

Doctor doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor doctor, please,
oh the mess I'm in

She walked up to me
and really stole my heart
And then she started
to take my body apart

*Livin', lovin', I'm on the run
Far away from you
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please
Oh, I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please,
oh, I'm goin' fast
It's only just a moment,
she's turnin' paranoid
That's not a situation for a nervous boy

Doctor doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor doctor, please,
oh, the mess I'm in

But you look so angry
as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strain,
and I can't take any more
