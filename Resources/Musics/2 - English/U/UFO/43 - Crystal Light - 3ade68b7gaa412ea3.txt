CRYSTAL LIGHT

Standin' by the roadside, future in my hands
Coat I'm wearing's blowing cold
Turn my back to the wind
Winter mist along the coast
City lights closed down
Your empty station there
Freight line cuts the ground
Freight line cuts the ground 

*Crystal light shinin' bright
Shine on down for me
Moon is even passin' by, tryin' not to see
Like a fool I hit that road, did my time at sea
Life was only foolin' me

Oh despair, it bums my lungs, 
find' it hard to breath 
The hospital shut their gates,
I can't get me no peace
Wicked people stand and scream,
stumble the

road
Close my eyes, turn out the lights
Haven't found a dream, haven't found a dream

* Repeat
* Repeat
