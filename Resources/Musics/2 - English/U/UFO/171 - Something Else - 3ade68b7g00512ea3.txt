SOMETHING ELSE

Look there! Here she comes 
Here comes that girl again 
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
She don't notice me when I pass 
She goes with all the guys out of my class 
That ain't stopping me from thinking to myself 
She's sure fine looking she's something else

Look there, cross the street 
There's a car made just for me 
To own that car would be a luxury 
Right now I can't afford the gas 
Brand new convertible's out of my class 
That ain't stopping me from thinking to myself 
That car's fine looking and she's something else

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Well look here wait and see 
Work hard and save my dough 
I bought a car at the motor show 
Me and that girl we go round and round 
Look real sharp with the flat top down 
Keep dreaming and thinking to myself 
If it comes all true she's something else

Look here what's all this 
Never gone through this before 
Here I am knocking on the door 
Car's out front, it's all mine 
It's a '49 job not a '59 
I got the girl and I'm thinking to myself 
She's sure fine looking she's something else
