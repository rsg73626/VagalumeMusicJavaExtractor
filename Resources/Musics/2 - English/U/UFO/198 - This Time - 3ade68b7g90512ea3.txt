THIS TIME

Maybe tomorrow 
Maybe next week 
Oh baby the future looks bleak 
I can't believe what's been goin' on 
You're never there 
You're always gone 
A little faith goin' a long way 
Always thought that you would stay [???] 
Diggin' for gold 
Movin' on, I'm out in the cold

* No no baby, I believed in you 
No no baby, it's not true 
No no baby, I believed in you 
Don't put my heart on the line

** This time, let it be me 
I'll be the one that you can see 
This time I'll be your man 
I'm right here baby, here in your hand

Situation is the classic kind 
Caught in this trap, oh love is blind 
Friends keep saying that you're bad news 
I keep saying how could you choose
[???] one more time 
Just to believe you are mine 
At the point of no return 
A fool in love, when will I learn

* Repeat 
** Repeat twice

There's no sign that this love of ours 
Will go on and on 
I took a long look at love 
From the point of view there's an Angel above..

[INSTRUMENTAL]

** Repeat 
There's no sign that this love of ours will go on and on 
** Repeat and fade
