GIVE IT UP

Well here's the good news
And here's the bad
It could hurt you darling
It could make you happy or sad

Ooh here she comes now!

It was a radio
Playing on the running board
With a Hey someone singing
My Sweet Lord
She was calling now
Come on in, let's get free
Where we go doesn't matter
If you just love me

Cos falling down
Time after time
Falling into the sea
Standing up's tough enough
Tough enough for me

Give it up, give it up
It's raining stones
Give it up darling, rattling bones
Give it up, give it up
It's called fate
Give it up darling
Lift off this weight

I've laid down in the gutter
Looking up at the stars
Washed by the rain
And these passing cars
I wanna feel something
And it's called happy again
I'm gonna leave this town
Change my name
Won't be back again

Cos falling down
Time after time
Falling into the sea
Cos standing up's tough enough
Tough enough for me

Give it up, give it up
It's raining stones
Give it up darling, rattling bones
Give it up, give it up
It's called fate
Give it up darling
Lift off this weight

Give it up, give it up
It's raining stones
Give it up darling, rattling bones
Give it up, give it up
It's called fate
Give it up darling
Lift off this weight

Give it up, give it up
It's raining stones
Give it up darling, rattling bones
Give it up, give it up
It's called fate
Give it up darling
Lift off this weight

Give it up, give it up
It's not too late
Give it up darling, rattling bones
Give it up, give it up
Don't let go
Give it up darling
Lift off this weight
