SWALLOW

If sometimes I could make you happy
If sometimes you're feeling small
The truth is mine just to do what I wanna do
This love is mine just to say what I wanna say

Out on this lonely road
Cold coffee and a cigarette
Making a long distance call
I'm on some losing bet

We're not going down
We're not gonna take it baby
We're not going down
Anyway you want it
We're not going down
We just got to be together now
And if you're feeling hollow
Hey, hey now swallow

And if your love's been lost and forsaken
If you've been left passed up and broken too
The choice is yours just to be where you wanna be
And the truth is yours just to see what you wanna see

Out on this lonely road
Where the black top never ends
We're racing up the hills
But we're losing it on the bends

We're not going down
We're not gonna take it baby
We're not going down
Anyway you want it
We're not going down
We just got to be together now
And if you're feeling hollow
Hey, hey now swallow

Solo

We're not going down
We've gotta be there together babe
We're not going down
Anyway you want it now
We're not going down
We've gotta be there
We've just gotta be together babe
And just your crazy ways
Oh there's not an ordinary day
Oh no
