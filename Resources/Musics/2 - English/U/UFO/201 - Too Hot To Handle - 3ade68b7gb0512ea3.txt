TOO HOT TO HANDLE

Caught in the crossfire, a warnin' fight
Legends make our brigades
Swept up on the road, in waves of the night-
In the chase for fame

I was too, too hot, baby 
Too hot to handle 
Yeah, I was too, too hot 
Too hot to handle

Wink of an eye, the feelings ran high 
A real rock and roll molest 
But I ain't no romance 
And I ain't no slow chance 
Won't get no quick change

*And I'm too, too hot, baby 
Too hot to handle 
Yeah, I'm too, too hot, baby 
Too hot to handle

**Sha la la la, roll you over 
Turn you around and do it again 
Sha la la la, keep on coming 
Do it once but never the same

[INSTRUMENTAL]

**Repeat

I'm in your town, won't fool around
I'll make some action stick 
Just like the story says, these boys are bad 
So keep out of shootin' range

* Repeat
