STEAL YOURSELF

It? s a long road
Take me back to you babe
It? s a long time
To get you off my mind

A sheaf of broken arrows
That won't fly true
Took a wrong turn
That took me home to you babe

Steal yourself
On cheap talking wine
Kill yourself
For one of your lies

You know you're gonna kill yourself

Take a backseat
Watch the buffalo
Feel this heart beat
Watch the night time glow
Dug a hole in my day
With your black cat stray
Took a long, long time baby
To get you off my mind

And you steal yourself
For one of those highs again
Kill yourself
For just one lie

And you steal yourself
On cheap talking wine
Kill yourself
For one of your lies
And you steal yourself
With one of your lies

And you steal yourself
For one of those highs again
Kill yourself
For just one lie

Steal yourself
On cheap talking wine
Kill yourself
For one of your lies

You know you're gonna kill yourself babe
You gonna tell one of those lies again
You just all were your highs
You gotta your cheap talking lies, oh yeah

Oh, here we come now, now, now
