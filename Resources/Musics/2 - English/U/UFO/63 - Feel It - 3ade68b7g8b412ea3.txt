FEEL IT

I hear the jukebox on its full playback 
Her high-heeled shoes go clickity-clack 
Sweet, sweet Suzy dress way low 
Does a dance just to let you know

* You wanna feel it, feel it 
Breaks your heart if you don't leave her alone 
Feel it, feel it It's one quick walk out in the danger zone

** Oooh, it's a love that makes you burn 
Oooh, well a promise that you can see 
Ooh every head she can she turns 
Ooh (well that's love) (when you get that love to keep)

The boys' in Danny's bar and Grill 
Swapping stories on the old cheap thrill 
But you pick up the air as she walks in 
She'll never talk much or try it again

* Repeat 
** Repeat

Every night she makes you dream a little more 
With a smile that opens every door 
In her eyes you'll see the promises 
One kiss tells everything

[INSTSRUMENTAL]

* Repeat 
** Repeat

Some girls you live with and some you need 
This one's the girl that's gonna make you bleed 
See her strut she moves from head to toe 
What you ain't got she'll never know

*Repeat 
**Repeat and fade
