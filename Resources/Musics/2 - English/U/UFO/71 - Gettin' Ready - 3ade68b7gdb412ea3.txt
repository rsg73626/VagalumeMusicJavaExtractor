GETTIN' READY

* You said that was that but this is it 
How were you to make the pieces fit 
Into a plan to start a new life 
Friends pat your back, then stab you with a knife

** I must be blind I'm gettin' ready to be defined 
No [loose connections] cause it feels alright 
I'm gettin ready to hit the [line]

Can you fee me Inside and out, I'm just waiting for you 
[Cuz] it's alright Now I know just what I want to do

** Repeat

When a day breaks, turns you around 
And your world upside down 
And the visions fade 
Rights and wrongs and just where you've gone

** Repeat

Making out is such an awful drag 
And I could lose my mind And every time that I turned around 
I never knew if I could really find you

[INSTRUMENTAL]

*Repeat 
** Repeat
