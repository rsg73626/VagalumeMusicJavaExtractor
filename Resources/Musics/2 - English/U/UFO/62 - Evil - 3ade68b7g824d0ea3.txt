EVIL

  



Heaven knows that you're an evil child 
Drive me crazy, you drive me wild 
Get home form work I don't feel all right 
Go in your bedroom you just wanna fight 
Movin' in, movin' out, baby you move my mind about 
Don't give me no reason, don't give me no lies 
Come to take you home from school you've brokin' all the rules 

All I need is a bit of your love 
All I want is to hold you tight 
All I need is a part of you... 

(instrumental.)
