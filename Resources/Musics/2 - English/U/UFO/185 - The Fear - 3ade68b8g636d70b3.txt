THE FEAR

It was something cool
Something bright
I had the fear in the middle of the night
Tore a page from a cooking book
It had a map to a Moroccan souk

Shame on me
Shame on you
You turned a lovely shade of blue

I got the fear now
I got the fear now
A bottle of wine and Turkish cigarettes
Your silky stockings and fine fishnets
I got the fear now
Gimme the fear now

A comet has landed on my door
I see the sheriff wagging like a whore
Shame on us
A shame to bear
We'll be locked up
Put rightin care

I got the fear now
Gimme the fear now

Liars, thieves and politicans
Kama Sutra in 20 positions
Gimme the fear now
I got the fear now

I have a crooked house
And a crooked bed
Mystical people in my head
I got the fear now
I got the fear now
Gimme the fear now
Gimme a beer now

I got the fear now
Gimme a beer now

I got the anger chased by rage
Actors up there right on stage
I am going downtown to get me some thrills
If I can make it through life's chills and spills
Gimme a beer now
