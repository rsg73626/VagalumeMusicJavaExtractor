MYSTERY TRAIN

Train arrive sixteen coaches long
Train arrive sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train
Drop my baby and gone

*Train train coming right round the bend 
Train train coming right round this bend 
Well it took my baby
But it never will again

Train train coming on down the line
Train train rolling on down the line
Well it's bringing my baby
'Cause she's mine oh mine
Mine oh mine, mine oh mine

(Repeat *)

Never again no, no, no never again
