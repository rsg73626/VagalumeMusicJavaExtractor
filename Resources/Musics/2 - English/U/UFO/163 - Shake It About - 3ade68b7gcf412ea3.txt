SHAKE IT ABOUT

Little girl, youre so fine 
With that body you gotta be mine
Was a brownie and i was a scout 
Baby i never knew how you shook it about

Do me a good dead give me what i need 
If you move like that i'll give you what's in store 
You won't come back asking me for more 

(//) .. Too hot aint slept so well 
Young boys troubles aren't doing me well 
Give me your kisses every night 
I wanna shake you and hold you tight,
i wanna shake... 

(--jammin'-- )
Since i met you i ain't slept so well 
Young boys trouble aren't doing me well 
Give me your kisses every night 
I wanna shake you and hold you tight 
Come on and shake, ah, ...shake....
