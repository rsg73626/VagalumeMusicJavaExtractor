ON THE WATERFRONT

Ever the dreamer baby
Well i don't need nobody
I don't need no girl
Going back to party town
Going way back in the sun
I see trouble coming
I'd watch your back
I see blood a-running

Down on the waterfront
Marlon and me
Out on the waterline
Skipping stones to the sea
Down on the waterfront
Marlon and me
Out on the waterline
Skipping stones to the sea

Well i've sold out forever
Sold my bit of peace
I got lost in something babe
All that paint and grease

I see trouble coming
I'd watch your back
I see blood a-running

Down on the waterfront
Marlon and me
Out on the waterline
Tossing stones to the sea
Down on the waterfront
Just you and me
Just rolling stones now
Toss them out to sea
