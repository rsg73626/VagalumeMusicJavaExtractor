CROSSING OVER

I see the lights,
I see the road
I see everything in the
highway code
I've been whipped
and I've been spun cown
there ain't no religion here
And I'm homeward bound


Wherever you go,
wherever you are
I am crossing over
to the other side
And now I am waiting for an answer,
some kind of sign
Looking for a love
to be my guide
I am crossing over
to the other side


Friendships come
and lifetimes go
In their passing to the
bigger show
The river runs,
the tides will turn
If there's a hell,
well I've yet to learn


Wherever you go,
wherever you are
I am crossing over
to the other side
And now I am waiting for an answer,
some kind of sign
Looking for a love
to be my guide
I am crossing over
to the other side


To dream the dream that's over
before it's gone
To hold your lover here
while your heart beats so strong
Baby when I love you
when everything is gone
When I'm kissing heaven
this love is never wrong


Solo


I hear the singing,
I hear the shout
The talk of meaning
for those in doubt
But amid all the wailing and
the wringing hands
Everybody thinks
does anyone understand?


Wherever you go,
wherever you are
I am crossing over
to the other side
And now I am waiting for an answer,
some kind of sign
Looking for a love
to be my guide
I am crossing over
to the other side


I am crossing over
to the other side
And now I am waiting for an answer,
some kind of sign
Looking for a love
to be my guide
Cos I am crossing over
to the other side
