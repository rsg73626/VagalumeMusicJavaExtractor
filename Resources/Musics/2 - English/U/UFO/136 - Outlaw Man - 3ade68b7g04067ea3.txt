OUTLAW MAN

I came out of the fifties
now that's when men were men
I am like the red red rooster,
always couping hens
I guess that I'm a rarity
some call a dying breed
I am a macho bronco stallion
call me Mr Seed


I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
I'm one big bone
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
Motorcycle man

love don't fit in a can


When you're talking Elvis,
well I saw him yesterday
He touched me on the shoulder
asked me if he could play
I buttered up my ducktail,
put on my long black drape
I polished up my Boneville
to make those girlies gape

I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
I'm one big bone
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
Motorcycle man

love don't fit in a can

I am one of lifes miracles
I have my fate in my hands
I see my colours before me
I am the outlaw man

the outlaw man

Solo

Jimmy Dean was riding next to me and Steve McQueen
And we're burning up the street now
And we're looking pretty mean
I'm not living in the past
and I'm not history
I'm here to set the records straight,
unlock this mystery


I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
I'm one big bone
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker
Motorcycle man

love don't fit in a can


I am one of lifes miracles
I have my fate in my hands
I see my colours before me
I am the outlaw man


I am one of lifes miracles
I have my fate in my hands
I see my colours before me
I am the outlaw man

I'm the outlaw man
