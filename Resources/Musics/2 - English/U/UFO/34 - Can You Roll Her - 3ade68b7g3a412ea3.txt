CAN YOU ROLL HER

* Fast as light our jets were burnin'
On the road a distant siren song
Hands upon my engines growin'
Vincent's[+++] deep throat breathin' out so strong
I can hold her, can you roll her

Ride her like there's no tomorrow
Siren's song sure is growin' stronger
Shadow reached a high note
And in the distance [electric lights]++++ no longer

I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her

* Repeat
* 
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her

+++Note: Mike Pincher informs me that a Vincent is a British motorcycle.
++++Mat's lyric sheet says this should be Electra Glides, another kind of motorcycle.
