VILLAINS AND THIEVES

Two guns went down to texas
Got two guns on the run
This town is full of money honey
That's how the west was won
Ain't nothing but money
Money is the honey
Gonna take it and run run run
A suitcase full of money
Lulu's earrings through her nose
Tattoos say come love me now
Wearing her mama's wedding clothes

Villains and thieves
Honky tonk jam in a moonshine can
Villains and thieves
Cowboys with cars
Mamas playing a tune on my guitar

I've got a black diamond cadillac
Baby's painting her toes
I've got the world sitting at my feet
Sharp shoes and a brand new nose

Villains and thieves
Honky tonk jam in a moonshine can
Villains and thieves
Cowboys with cars
Mamas playing a tune on my old guitar

Semprini sings tonight
He has magic hands
He's sings like a bird now
And he's going to go down the pan
