REASONS LOVE

A little bit of you runnin' through my bed
Little bit of everything
You know that's what you said

* Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love 
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love

** And there's your indulgence
And parents try to get you out of these jams 
You got that appetite they won't understand

The social life you lead leaves nothin' to desire 
Don't wanna see you bleed
But you came on like a liar -Repeat

* Repeat
** Repeat

Wrecked myself to love you
All you want is more
One thing you're after
You just try and score
* Repeat
** Repeat
