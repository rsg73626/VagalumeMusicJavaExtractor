Yo C-Murder 
Nigga you woke? 
Keep your eyes on the rollers nigga. 
Pass the weed (ok)

We gon' pick up Pimp C, and Bun B (that's my niggas there) 
We gon' get rowdy rowdy and bout it bout it 
We gon' handle our business 
We gon' smoke 
We gon' make it back to the N.O. 
Cuz u know whut? 
Us South niggaz don't playa hate 
We got love from the South, East, West, to the Nizorth 
But it's your time baby 
We gon' handle our business 
And we gonna do this shit like g'z 
We gonna represent the gizame 
Ya heard me? 

[Pimp C] 

This game fucked up 
I ain't got no friends 
I done spend my last 70,000 dollars on a drop-top bienz 
Ugh, and I'm a real nigga 
Down to put a forty-five to his hilfiger 
Lay it down muthafucka because I'm bustin' for mine 
Take them out everytime and I ain't try to dine 
Niggaz dyin' port authur (huh nigga what?) 
Thank that I'm playin? (huh nigga what?) 
Bust 17 times and let 'em feel what I'm sayin' 
UGK and C-Murder 
Cadillac and a Tank (Master P) 
Bout to fade the platinum 
Smoke some dank and some drank 
But bitch luv me when I come to your city 
Serve my dick out her pussy 
and bust my nuts on her titties 
Ugh, it's just a matter of time before I'm up in your house 
With my mask on my face and my thang in your mouth 
Now get your mind right nigga (mind right) 
and make a pimp bitch 
and never put trust in a trick ass bitch 
[chorus x4] 

I'm fingida pull akickdoe! (ugggggggghhhhhh!) 
Lay down on the flo' (flo') 
Want the cheese and the money or everybody gotta go (gotta go) 

[Bun B] 

They try to run up in the manger (run up) 
Now hold oon Bun B 
I see me P and C in danger (danger) 
Just like the ATF, HPD, and Texas Rangers 
Fuckin' with me and my middle fanga. 
But to this shit nigga we ain't strangers 
But I Gotta bust my magnums 
Gotta gage these pistols 
Hand grenades, and land mines 
chopper smoke bombs and missiles 
Some of them bitches whistle 
Some of them bitches silent 
But all them bitches handle business 
All of them violent 
Bout it bout it and dangerous 
soldiers that wanna gang with us 
Bang with us, hang with us 
get that No Limit slang with us 
I came to bust every ass in my way till it's over 
so get the chip off your shoulder 
fix your lip 
I done told yah 
we own 5 on your bitch in your bumpin' conflicts 
Nigga I can see that you got plicked 
Sit down and take a time trip 
this ain't nothin' ta sneeze at 
the fear in your eyes I see 
bitch where's the key's & g'z at? 

[chorus x2] 

[C-Murder] 

Lay it down muthafucka 
Everybody gotta go 
Give me the loot is what I tell 'em 
When I kick in the doe' 
Nigga I'm mad at the world 
for my lack of havin' papers 
Fuck the law and the cops 
Cuz I'm down for a caper 

[Master P] 

Some say we dangerous 
Especially when we broke 
I'm mo daily than a dope fiend fiendin' for dope 
I just live for confetti 
You see I'm deadly like Freddy 
I run through your house and leave it messy like messy 

[C-Murder] 

I got to much stress in my head 
I wanna take my own life 
My last chance is a 211 
But it got me thankin' twicee 
It's a drought right now 
So these drugs ain't happenin' 
And if it wasn't for No Limit 
there would be no money or rapping. 

[Master P] 

You see my boy had a bumper full of keyz and g'z 
The word on the street is his homie told his baby momma to freeze! 
You see you can't trust nobody in this dope game 
keep your eyez on your enemies 
Stack some chips and get out man. 

[C-Murder] 

Give me a ski-mask, a 9 
I'll be a down ass nigga 
And watch me pull a flee-flicker 
And make my cheese get bigger 
If I get caught it's 25, but that don't mean shit 
Cuz if I go to jail it's gotta be better than living like this 
Nigga 2 shots in the air 
Cuz I ain't bout bein' broke 
And if you bout i make a move 
nigga, everybody gotta go 
Just some bout it niggaz from New Orleans 
With tapes hooked up 
C-Murder, Master P, and UGK 
Now Nigga what? 

[chorus till fade]
