HISIDE

Pimp C talking) 
Uh no love 
Now check this out 
Bitches be gettin offended when uh they hear the word bitch 
Well maybe that's cause they bitches 
Know what I'm talkin bout 

(Pimp C) 
Stankin bitches say I hiside 
Cause I pass by 
Don't smoke my fuckin weed wit em 
Don't let em sit on my plush crush 
Three times gold, I'm a pimp ass nigga 
So like a ball is how I roll 
And I don't be paradin with them bitches in the street 
Ho is you payin me? 
Well if not ain't no need in you thinkin that you gon stay wit me 
Bitch I'm a pimp cause that's the way you bitches force me to be 
You say you broke well bitch you need to stop fucking for free 
So when I ride by, I don't give the ho the time 
Lil' girl you fine, but you must done lost yo mind 
Thinkin you got game 
Well bitch game is my middle name 
Suckin on thangs, fuckin for fame 
But bitch you plain Jane 
Straight up and down 
I hate silly hoes that talk a lot and try to clown 
When she know that I know that she done fucked the whole town 
And that I know that she a freak 
Bitches say we hiside cause we pass and don't speak 

Don't speak, don't speak 

Bitches say we hiside cause we pass by and don't speak 
I know they wanna freak (3x) 

Bitches say we hiside cause we pass by 

(Bun B) 
Sometimes there be a lot of shit I wanna do 
But won't do, if I gotta do shit in front of you 
Oh bitch don't act like you ain't nosy 
I know exactly how you hoes be 
Blowzy mad cause I declined when you chose me 
But what I need a broke bitch for? 
And how the fuck I look walkin around scratchin yo witch ho? 
No keep them crabs keep that cock in that case 
Cause bitch a pussy ain't nothin but my hand wit a face 
And any bitch can take another bitch place 
Now ain't that a foul taste 
And it wasn't a fuck it was a waste of my mutherfuckin time 
I coulda been somewhere flippin or smokin a dime 
These bitches now a days out of they rabbit ass mind 
Ho you gets no sunshine from me just because you fine 
I told em I heard it through the grapevine 
You ain't nothin but a freak 
So now bitches say we hiside cause we pass by and don't speak 

Chorus 

(Pimp C) 
See bitches in P.A. 
Get mad when they see a young nigga 
full of that chronic havin it his way 
But them hoes got us fucked up 
The preacher got the clothes and the hoes wit his dick on swoll 
Trickin all my people bank roll 
I peep that shit, I read my Bible at home 
Cause I ain't payin for that nigga's wrong 
It's time to ride 600, picture me and Bun B 
wit 4 million two drop top gold royces 
Now we smokin somethin 
Them bitches tried to set us up, but we 
Butt-fuck the D.A, fuck the judge, and fuck the P.A.P.D. 
I already gotta deal with the rednecks 
And ho ass niggas in this rap game comin with that complex 
But bitch this ain't no fuckin contest 
And if it was we won 
I'm a trill nigga live my life by the gun 
I love smokin swisher sweets 
Uh, now fuck them bitches that say we hiside 
cause we pass by and don't speak 

(Pimp C talking and the chorus fades until the end
