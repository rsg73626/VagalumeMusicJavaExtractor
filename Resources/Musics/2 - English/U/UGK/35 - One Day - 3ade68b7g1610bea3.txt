ONE DAY

featuring 3-2 and Ron Isley 

3-2 
Mama put me out at only fourteen 
So I start sellin crack cocaine and codeine 
Time to stack some paper think I'm a do it quick 
Thinkin I'm a juvenile but they dont know who they messin wit, yeah 
My mama's only son 
But I live everyday like its my muthafuckin last one 
Every nigga and they mama askin why 
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'm a die 
But if I die or should I say if I go 
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go 
Cause tomorrow aint promised to me 
The only thing promised to a playa is the penetentiary 
So I'm a take care of my business on the smooth tip 
Watch my back sellin crack and pack two clips 
When ya think about that you say "it'll be on" 
Its a trip youre here today but the next day youre gone 

One day youre here, baby 
But then youre gone (repeat)

This world we livin in man it aint nuthin but drama 
Everyone wanna harm ya in New york niggas gettin shot fo bombers 
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California 
Niggas who roll that hydroponic-marijuana 
Gangbangin got the ghetto hotter than a sauna 
Back in Orange my nigga Pop died on the corner 
Behind a funky-ass dice game 
I saw once before he died wished it was twice mayn 
I remember bein eight deep off in Chucky crib 
Lettin us act bad not givin a fuck what we did 
When we lost him I knew the world was comin to the end 
And I had to quit lettin that devil push me to a sin 
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten 
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin in 
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin zone 
Cause one day you here but the next day you gone 

One day you here baby 
But then youre gone (repeat) 

Pimp C 
I'm up early cuz aint enough light in the daytime 
Smoke two sweets get in these streets out the pop up line 
Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes 
Ak loader as I get swallowed under city lights 
Niggas be lookin shife so I look shife back 
Cant show no weakness in these streets you'll get yo life jacked 
Mayn its a trip where i stay especially for me 
This bitches tryin to lock me up for the whole century 
They gave my boy down in Florida Dante 19 
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean 
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I aint no liar 
My man RoRo jus lost his baby in a house fire 
And then when I got on my knees that night to pray 
I asked God why he let these killas live and take my homeboy's son away 
Man if you got kids show em you love em cuz God jus might call em home 
Cuz one day you here but baby the next day you gone
