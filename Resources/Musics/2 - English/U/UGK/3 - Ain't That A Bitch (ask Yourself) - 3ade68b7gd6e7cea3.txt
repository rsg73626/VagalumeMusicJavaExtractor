AIN'T THAT A BITCH (ASK YOURSELF)

f/ Devin the Dude

[Pimp C]
You stayin' with that trick, layin' with that trick
All your paper off playin' with that trick
At first, all you want to do is [fuck] with the trick
Years pass by, now you stuck with the trick
Fighting more and more now you're fed up with the trick
But you knew that was a [ho] when you hooked up with the trick
But you trusted the[bitch] 'cause you lust for the [bitch]
(This line was too edited for me to typed out)
Now she around this [motherfucka] pregnant and [shit]
But a child to a [nigga] this seem nothin' but a lick
The next thing you know the [bitch] got you in court
Tryin' to get your paper calling it child support
Takin' half of your [shit] talkin' bout a divorce
If you don't know the game, well here's the crash course
They say "You live with the [bitch] so common law marry."
And the [bitch] got accustomed to the paper she's been having

[Chorus: Devin the Dude singing]
Ain't that a bitch? (Pimp C: Ain't that a bitch?)
Ain't that a bitch?, now ask yourself ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch?

I got a letter from the government the other day
I open and read it, said "[Fuck] UGK.
We've been watching your success ever since[niggas] dropped
We would've spoke a long time, but we thought you would've flopped
Man, two [niggas] got some [heat], you graduated to mainstream status
From being two broke[niggas] from off the cut, growing up in a town
Where's population 50,000, only 3 high schools, but 8 sets of low-income housing
Look, when you two did 'Too Hard To Swallow'  We Thought it was a fluke
When you boys came 'Super Tight' we played it cool hand luke
'Ridin Dirty' went gold with no video we gave a break
But this MTV award nomination [shit] just took the cake
So read this letter real good and take it as a warning
We'll be watching you when you asleep and when you wake up in the morning
The people that you running with and everything you do
Sincerely Yours, Sign, You know [motherfucking] who." Ain't that a bitch?

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
Just when you thought that [ho] was especially for you
You put all your trust in the [bitch] and guess what she do?
Around two in the mornin' that [ho] gone
Then she come with some different clothes on
I guess the [bitch] is so fine that you pay it no mind
You asked her where you been she said "with one of her friends" that [ho] lying
Her [pussy] is a gold mine, well that how she feels
She can get a few thangs for exchange for cheap thrills
The price of [pussy] is turning women into [whores]
And just because they give you some that [pussy] ain't yours
So I don't trip on it, but I'll stab if I can
Then wipe off my weapon, then turn into the traveling man
Like this [bitch] Ruby Tuesday, Friday I'd had to slap the [ho]
The [bitch] got knocked up by Roscoe, and said that I'm the poppa though
In this game they got a name for this chick, who gettin' rich by lickin' [dick]

[Chorus]
