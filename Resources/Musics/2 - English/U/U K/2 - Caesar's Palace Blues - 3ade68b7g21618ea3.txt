CAESAR'S PALACE BLUES

Creamed-up kitten screaming for her next injection 
Dead dog in the driveway - protein intection 
The most exclusive restaurants have a few uninvited divers 
Don't worry if you're under age - they've special schemes for minors 

Caesar's Palace blues 

You lost your shirt on your last hand, you nearly sold your shoes 
You came up tumps last weekend so you've got to pay your dues 
Cards fall, faces change, Cat's cunning shows 
Same rules still apply, either way you lose 

Caesar's Palace blues 

Lovers on the carpet, Cupid's dream for certain 
But there's always someone hiding right behind the hotel curtain 
They've cameras in the casino and bugs under your bed 
But all the gold in Reno couldn't bring old Caesar back from dead.
