CARRYING NO CROSS

Stop...

been wrong so many times before 
was always laying down the law 
and all attractions ware a bore 
they led me back to you 

Uniforms were an allergy 
they never felt quite right to me 
they conjured wartime Germany 
ang God knows we need that 

Temptation boundaries does vener know 
the time when my morale was low 
the circumstances always show 
the place was yours or mine 

Carrying no cross before me 
with no prze no to idolize no story 
to hell of adolescent glory 

Just void... empty spaces nothing to show 
no point of reference to place to go 
but one thing I'd ignored and so 
the light came shining through 

INSTRUMENTAL 

I've been wrong so many times before 
was always laying down the law 
one thing you cannot ignore 
bad boys can come clean 

Emotions I could not control 
Illuminate my heart and soul 
I saw a light, I scored a goal 
and what price peace of mind?
