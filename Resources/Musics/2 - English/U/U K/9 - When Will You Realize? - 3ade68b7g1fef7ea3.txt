WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE?

When will you realize? (x 4)

This is the year that we all live in fear
For there's no use for you and i
And it's somebody's dream
Automatic machine
That is run from a central cell

And you'll see
That the tape is so red
That it bleeds
And it takes care of everyone's needs
Till they die!

This is the day you should wake up and say
You'll discover what's going down
Because maybe you're thinking that life's everlasting
But no
There's something wrong
When you're sure
That the odds are all stacked on your side
But you're only along for the ride
You want out (?)

When will you realize? (x 4)

This is the hour as it starts to turn sour
And you find out that love's a sad game
This is the moment
You're losing
Confusing
That same old sympathy

But you carried on
And you danced till the guests had all gone
There was no one to carry you home
You're alone
All alone

When will you realize? (x 4)
