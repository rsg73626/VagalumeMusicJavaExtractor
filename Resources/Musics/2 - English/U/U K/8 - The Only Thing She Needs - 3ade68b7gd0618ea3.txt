THE ONLY THING SHE NEEDS

Midnight Mass a yellow moon 
Wonder walked from my window 
Now she sings a different tune 
Golden tunes, out of the blue 

Now the sky is clearing 
Looking through her crystal eyes 
Waiting Windows loom before hre 
Cutting her back down to size 

The thing she's searching for is 
The only thing she needs 

Gazing in simplycity 
toward ambitions that she craves 
The best thing since Arithmetic 
MBB's and current raves 

Now the sky is clearing 
Looking through her crystal eyes 
Waiting Widows loom before her 
Cutting her back down to size 

The thing she's searching for is 
The only thing she needs
