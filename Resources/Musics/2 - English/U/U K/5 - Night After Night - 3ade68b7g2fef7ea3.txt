NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

Darkness descends on the freeway
Traffic lines turning to stone
I'm driving myself half crazy
I wish i were headed for home
Say girl when we're not together
I feel like i'm losing my mind

Night after night

I look in the eyes of a stranger
Reminding myself of the past
Yesterday is what i will leave it
The future is moving too fast
Say girl when we're not together
I feel like i'm losing my mind

(chorus b)
Night after night
It's the same lousy fight
And i know it ain't right that
It's night after night

I see the red lights on the runway
The jet is moving too fast
I hear the last roar of the engine
And beautiful silence at last
Think of the distance between us
All of the words left unsaid

(repeat chorus)

[hammond solo]

Think of the distance between us
All of the words left unsaid

(repeat chorus)
