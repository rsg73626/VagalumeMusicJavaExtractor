NOTHING TO LOSE

Nothing to lose 

Now I can really break it 
Now I don't have to fake it 
Forget it then I don't need it 
If it ain't hot I'll leave it 

Nothing to show but no-one to stop me I'm going away 
I'm kicking my heels, rolling the wheels and I'm leaving today yeah, yeah 

Nothing to lose 

I gotta run for my life 
Shoot out and shine those searchy lights 
I'm really top cross that border line 
'm going to make it stick this time 

Nothing to show but no-one to stop me I'm going away 
I'm kicking my heels, rolling the wheels and I'm leaving today yeah, yeah 

Nothing to lose
