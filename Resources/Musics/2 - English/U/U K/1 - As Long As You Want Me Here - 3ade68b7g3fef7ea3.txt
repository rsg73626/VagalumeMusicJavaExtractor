AS LONG AS YOU WANT ME HERE

Don't let me catch you with no-one else
That would cost you dear
I'll stay beside you 'til the end of time
(by your side)
As long as you want me here

If you should stand me upon a stage
Naked before my peers
I'd sing my heart out for you every night
As long as you want me here

(chorus)
As long as you want me here
I'll do anything for you
Tell me what else can i do
I don't care what people say
Here i am and here i'll stay
(in any order)

I see your photos in those magazines
(pictures)
They burn me up inside
I'll work forever just keep you satisfied
As long as you want me here

And if catastrophies fall on you
I surely will appear (??)
I'll follow gladly to hell and back (??)
As long as you want me here

(repeat chorus)

I will stick to you, as long as you don't put me down
'cause i won't be leaving you, believe me i'll be around

(repeat chorus)
