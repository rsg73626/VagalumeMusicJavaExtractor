INFANTICIDE

Power of evil lies deep in your soul
Conjur the dead for the life you hold
Children's bodies lay deep below
In their graves, in their holes

You love to kill in the midnight moon
Another kid dies, almost too soon
Feel your anguish, feel your need
To kill children and unborn seeds

Your fantasy reinacted through events
Upbring of life you prevent
Social-genocide, the way of the streets
Kill in graceful, mechanical heat

Infanticide, to kill the children
Hide 'em below your infectious building
Pain and anguish, you hold your hell
Fall deeper and deeper, to the pits of hell

Mournful parents hunt you by day
Trying to bring back the kid you killed today
Infanticide, the way you kill
Fall deeper to the anguish of hell

You may think I'm on your side
Now its time to bid you goodbye
'Member that girl you killed first?
She was mine, time to quench my thirst
