WHISPERED DREAMS

Dream, with me tonight
Close your eyes and whisper goodnight
Sail across the sea with me
Seems as though you'll be

I'll be dreamin' of that day too
I'll be there for you, day after day
Flowers of the midst of
Someone like you

Remember our love
It means that a dream, is just a dream
Live a memory deep inside me
Thank god you'll finally see


I'll be dreamin' of that day too
I'll be there for you, day after day
Flowers of the midst of
Someone like you
