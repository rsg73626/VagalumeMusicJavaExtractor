HUMAN CANDLE

Encroach upon me now
Oh, master of the underworld
Take me back with you
I'll suffer upon the pyre of hell

Internal! Pain! What's wrong with me?

Burn! Now! Fire from the inside out

Ashes! Dust! Spontaneous...Human combustion

It's so very hot down here
Live and burn just to die again
Fires burn white and laugh with glee
Damned for sure, eternal darkness to see

Contend! Comprehend? Why must I burn?

Confusion! Dismay! My charred body remains

Forever! Damned! Spontaneous...Human combustion

Explain this death I've endured
For eons I'll burn, a human candle
My soul reeks of torment and brimstone
Extinguish this flame and set my soul free

Human candle
