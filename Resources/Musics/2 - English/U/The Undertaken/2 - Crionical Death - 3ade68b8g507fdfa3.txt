CRIONICAL DEATH

I was put away, for a hundred years
Frozen body, frozen tears
Ruptured cells, died in my soul
Couldn't survive, in the cold

And I see... my older years
Slipping away
And I feel... my tissue crack
I'm melting away

Was revived once, but death came soon
Being frozen meant my life's doom
I was kept alone, waiting for cures
Thought it'd be soon, mind no longer stirs

And I see... my whole life
Fading away
And I feel my body frozen
I'm melting away
