WAKE THE DEAD

Yeah, This is not natural (This is not natural)
A bunch of holes where the dead used to be underground
Forget supernatural (Forget supernatural) 
'cause all those resting in peace are out and walking the streets
Yeah, with no heartbeat

Across the sky they can hear you on the other side
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead.
Wake the dead!

Oh, This is not possible (Yeah this is not possible)
An empty hole in your chest where your heart used to beat
Does this mean what I think it means? (Does it mean what i think it means?)
How could both you and me be about as dead as we could be
Yeah, with no heartbeat.

Across the sky they can hear you on the other side
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead (Wake the dead)
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead.
Wake the dead!

Take a walk with me, Walk with the dead
'Cause you knew that we had to die sometime (Yeah)
Well darling, Tonight could be (Darling tonight could be)

Let your voice shred miles of diamond skies
Just to walk as they wake in the darkness (Yeah)
Well darling tonight could be a beautiful night to die
A beautiful night to die
Yeah

Wake the dead!
Fuck it! Your dead!
Wake the dead!
Fuck it! Yeah!
Wake the dead! Wake the dead!

Across the sky they can haha-hear you
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead. 
Wake the dead!

Across the sky they can hear you on the other side
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead.
Wake the dead!
Wake the dead!
Wake the dead!
Wake the dead!
Wake the dead!
