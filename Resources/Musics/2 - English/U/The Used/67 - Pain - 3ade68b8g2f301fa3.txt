PAIN

Fade away
So you don't make a scene
Close your mouth
And try keeping it closed forever
Afraid of what you are
Afraid of how you learn to close your mouth
And try keeping it closed forever

If you had the mind to just check out
Something better than nothing
I'm not the type to scream and shout
Yeah

Pain
It pains me, don't you see where?
Rather it be lost in a river without you
Pain, pain, pain

You made your point
You don't know what to say
Close your mouth
And try keeping it closed forever
You never come so close
You never got this far to close your mouth
And try keeping it closed forever

If you had the mind to just check out
Something better than nothing
I'm not the type to scream and shout
Yeah

Pain
It pains me, don't you see where?
Rater it be lost in a river without you
Pain, pain, pain

Shame
Of what you are and what you did
It must be hard getting tired in your shoes
Shame, shame, shame

So cry that day
Gray clouds, black haze
So sure the sun could collapse your ways
So cry that day
(so cry that day)
So cry that day
(so cry that day)

So cry that day
(so cry that day)
So cry that day
(so cry that day!)

Pain
It pains me, don't you see where?
Rater it be lost in a river without you
Pain, pain, pain

Shame
Of what you are and what you did
It must be hard getting tired in your shoes
Shame, shame, shame

Pain!
Pain!
Keep your eyes closed!
Keep your eyes closed!
Keep your eyes closed!
Keep your eyes closed!
Keep your eyes closed!
Closed!
Closed!
Closed!
