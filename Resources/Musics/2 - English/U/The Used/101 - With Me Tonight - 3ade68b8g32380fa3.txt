WITH ME TONIGHT

The way I broke your heart very literally 
This ghost haunts me more than it should be 
I'm not gonna walk away or turn my head in shame 
I never thought it could kill me 

A clean slate, one more day further away 

I want you, You don't want me 
My mistake for wasting yours and mine 
I want you but will you stay with me today (with me today) 

Just let me make some time to take it back a little 
The way you smile shines the heavens above me 
Never going to let you go, I want you all the time 
I gotta prove you can trust me 


(3x) A clean slate, one more day further away

I want you, You don't want me 
My mistake for wasting yours and mine 
I want you but will you stay with me today (with me today)

I need you, you don't need me 
When you are low, I am not okay 
I want you but will you stay with me today? (with me today)
