LISTENING

Your skin attached this fragile cliche
Of my broken heart attack
You should swallow your teeth and hang out
Stay for a while
If your heart's still beating it must be the blood
If your lungs are still working it must be the mud
If its still light out than a kick in the ribs
today's worth living

I don't see anything now
So just say what you wanna say
It's kind of funny how you're not listening anyway
Lights out, I can't stand to hear you scream
While we were making love I was fast asleep
and the night sky better give something up (give something up)

I don't see anything now
So just say what you wanna say
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway
[x2]

Lights out, lights out...
Lights out, I can't stand to hear you scream
While we were making love I was fast asleep
If your heart's still beating it must be the blood
If your lungs are still working it must be the mud
If its still light out than a kick in the ribs
today's worth living

I don't see anything now
So just say what you wanna say
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway
[x2]

I'm not listening anyway
I'm not listening anyway
I'm not listening

Listening, I'm not listening
I'm not listening
I'm not listening
I'm not listening
