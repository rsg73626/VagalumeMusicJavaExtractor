SOUND EFFECTS AND OVERDRAMATICS

"Sound Effects And Overdramatics"

When the shirt came off, it was all in time
When a m-m-m-minute turned into a mile
And then I broke that grin, and I cut it out
And you got all turned on by the taste of your sin
When I mention blue, all you thought was color
When you mention drugs, all I thought was sober
When your pants came off and I turned you over
When you mention blue

Kill! Smile! Cut it out for me this time! 
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

Keep the mask aligned
Get it up in time
There's a space between valleys
and try and catch a vibe 
Make a circle square, a rectangle curve 
Use a smile as a noun and I think like a verb 
Run quick switch sides 
Spill the filled up canister 
And the room is shaking 
Now you're changing places,
and I switched my pace, 
and my breathing races when you mention blue 

Kill! Smile! Cut it out for me this time!
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while
Kill! Smile! Cut it out for me this time! (This is not [x6])
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while
Kill, smile, cut out for me cut it cut it out 
Smile, cut cut it out for me cut it cut it out
We cut it out!
Kill! Smile! Cut it out for me this time!
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while
Kill! Smile! Cut it out for me this time! (This is not [x6])
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a while

Get down and stay awake 
Smile
