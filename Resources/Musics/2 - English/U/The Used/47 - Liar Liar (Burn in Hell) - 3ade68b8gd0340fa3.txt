LIAR LIAR (BURN IN HELL)

Liar liar pants on fire 
And the pills go down and get you higher 
Baby bottle's burning, mother fucker 
And the mother hates him like the daughter 
Only god and maker gripping tighter 
Saying you will burn in hell they say, you will burn in hell 

Liar liar pants on fire 
Liar liar stop your soul from catching 
Fire fire god and maker 
Liar liar pants on fire 

Liar liar house of fire 
and the glass stays smashed, the two-way ladder 
but your tummy (?) hurts you 
your motherfucker mother never loved you 
father touched you with the hand of god, he's gripping tighter, saying
You will burn in hell 

Liar liar pants on fire 
Liar liar stop yourself from catching 
Fire fire god and maker 
Liar liar you fucking liar 

You're gonna burn in hell 
You're gonna burn in hell 
Hell hell hell 
You will burn in hell they say 
You will burn in hell â€“ fucking liar 

Liar liar pants on fire 
Liar liar stop yourself from catching 
Fire fire god and maker 
Liar liar you fucking liar 

Liar liar pants on fire 
Liar liar stop yourself from catching 
Fire fire god and maker 
Liar liar you fucking liar 
You fucking liar 
Liar liar you fucking liar 
Liar liar you fucking liar 
Liar liar you fucking liar

Liar Liar, Pants on fire...
Hanging from Mom...
Song from Liar
