OVERDOSE

(It goes back before the cross
The myth of Adam and Eve
Or all the gods of the Greeks)

Does it start all at once?
Or come as slow as can be
It's not about you and me
And never mind what it costs
At least it's not make believe
We can get it for free
But to get love
You have got to give love
Somehow I got your love
Was it luck or was it meant to be

Your love
Is my drug
I've overdosed
I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Your love
Is fatal
Planning an overdose
? an overdose

Then just like in the books
'The Voices' spoke unto me
Their words as clear as can be
They Say: no one can take it away
Nothing can come in-between
You can't steal something that's free
But to get love
You have got to give love
Somehow I got your love
Was it meant to be

And in the end I found peace
don't know why you would choose me
And in the end I found peace
My darling drug you kill me
Don't think we're meant to go it alone
I could be wrong but I'll wait and see
I get caught up when you're singing along
An overdose would come naturally
It might sound mean but don't get me wrong
If I'm a slave, I don't wanna be free
I get fucked up when you sing along
An overdose would come naturally
