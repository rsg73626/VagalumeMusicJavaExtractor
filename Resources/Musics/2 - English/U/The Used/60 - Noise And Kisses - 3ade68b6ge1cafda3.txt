NOISE AND KISSES

Look in my eyes, 
I'm jaded now, whatever that means 
By sharing these things. 
I rip my heart out 
It's worth my time, whatever that means... 
Hard to see up, 
My neck feels stiff 
Until I wake up. 
The orange I choked 
And back to my neck.
It's worth my time,
Whatever that means, so...

Share with me,
Cause I need it right now, 
Let me see your insides
Or rip me off,
Cause I'd rather starve now
If you won't open up

Give it to me, give me all whatever you want.
It's never been me to want this much
From you I can see
So share with me,
Cause I need it right now, let me see your insides 
Or rip me off,
Cause I'd rather starve now
If you won't open up.

Look in my eyes,
I'm jaded now, whatever that means
By sharing these things
I rip my heart out
It's worth my time, 
Whatever that means, so...

Share with me, 
Cause I need it right now, 
Let me see your insides 
Or rip me off, 
Cause I'd rather starve now 
If you won't open up.
