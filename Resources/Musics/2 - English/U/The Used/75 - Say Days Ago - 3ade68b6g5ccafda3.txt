SAY DAYS AGO

SAY DAYS AGO
 
I still remember a year ago
The times we spent
I feel that I'm happier now
I'm up from the down
By all means
It's strange 'cause I feel the same way

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes, tastes

Same strange
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same

Same strange, same strange 'cause I feel the same
Still remember what it tastes like, what it felt like

Makes me ill, me ill

Strange 'cause I feel the same

I think of what it looks like,
I think of what it tastes like,
I think of what it looks like,
I think of what it tastes, tastes

Same strange, same strange 'cause I feel the same,
Same strange, same strange 'cause I feel the same

Still remember what it tastes like, what it felt like, felt like

Same strange cause I feel the same
God, it makes me ill, makes me ill, makes me, makes me ill
God it makes me ill [x3]

Makes, uh
