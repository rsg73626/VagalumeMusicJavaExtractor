IN A NEEDLE

You've given me, nowhere to go
Yeah you finally have control
And if there's a cure
I Don't wanna know cause this poison in me so
intoxicating
I was right when I thought you would be bad for my
health
Keep on telling myself that it's alright
Now I'm back 'cause I cant get this taste of my mouth
And I do not intend to try

You suck me in and spit me out
Can not control the feeling
Poisonous kisses from your mouth
That leave me so addicted

Yeah that's me, nowhere to go
I have given up control
Walk in the sun
To the sand
With the one that kills me standing hand in hand
And we?ll just wait till the day has burned out into
the sea
Till we finally seen the moonlight
And then we?ll swim far away from where we hated to be
Always knowing that nothing's alright 

You suck me in and spit me out
I can not control the feeling
Poisonous kisses from your mouth
That leave me so addicted

I let you in you knock me out
No air that's left for breathing
Poisonous kisses from your mouth
That leave me so addicted

Yeah you're a part of me, a part I can not let go
Your love's so poisoning
Can?t tell is this a dream
Is there no way to wake up?

When I looked up you were the only one around
I couldn't move and so you picked me off the ground
I'll stay addicted to the poison that I love (Addicted
to the poison that I love)

You suck me in and spit me out
I can not control the feeling
Poisonous kisses from your mouth
That leave me so addicted

I let you in, you knock me out
No air that's left for breathing
Poisonous kisses from your mouth
That leave me so addicted

That leave me so addicted
