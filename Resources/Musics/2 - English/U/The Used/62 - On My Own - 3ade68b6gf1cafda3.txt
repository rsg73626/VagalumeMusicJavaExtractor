ON MY OWN

See all those people on the ground
Wasting time
Try to hold it all inside
But just for tonight
On top of the world
Sitting here wishing
The things I've become
But something is missing
Maybe I...
But what do I know 

And now it seems that I have found
Nothing at all
I want to hear your voice out loud
Slow it down, slow it down
Without it all
I'm choking on nothing
It's clear in my head
And I'm screaming for something
Knowing nothing is better than knowing it all 

On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own

Without it all
I'm choking on nothing
It's clear in my head
And I'm screaming for something
Knowing nothing is better than knowing it all

On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
