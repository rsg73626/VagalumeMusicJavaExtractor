ON THE CROSS (SAVE YOURSELF MIX)

I needed to pray, got down on my knees
I asked for a break from sympathy
It started off soft and it grew to a scream
I doubt anyone was listening

Forget what I said
Ignore all the voices in my head
Is that what it takes,
What it takes to believe?
I'm keeping my eyes open to see

So pray then, if it makes you feel safe
And all I can say is we go our own way
We go our own way
So save us

Drink from the cup, and you shall receive
Sipping my glass that's half-full of empty
I needed to hurt, I needed to bleed
I need to feel something happening

I got on my knees
To ask for a break from sympathy
Is that what it takes,
What it takes to believe?
I'm keeping my eyes open to see

So pray then, if it makes you feel safe
And all I can say is we go are own way

So pray then, if it makes you feel safe
And all I can say is we go are own way
We go are own way
So save us

Over and over and I still cannot believe
We can't save ourselves
Give me a chance to find the cross and watch me bleed
And I'll ask for help

Having faith in something you can't see
Takes something else
Over and over and I still cannot believe
We can't save ourselves

So pray then, if it makes you feel safe
And all I can say is we go are own way

So pray then, if it makes you feel safe
NAnd all I can say is we go are own way
Send your prayers our way
To save us
