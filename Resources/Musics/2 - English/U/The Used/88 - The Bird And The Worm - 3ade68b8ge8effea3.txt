THE BIRD AND THE WORM

He wears his heart safety pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows...
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul...

Chorus:
All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death!
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life
He crawls like a worm from a bird!
(all alone)
(crawls like a worm from a bird)

Whispers of...(just keep working...just keep
working...im terrified)

Verse 2:
Out of his mind away
Pushes him whispering:
"musta been out of his mind..."
Mid-day dillusions of pushing this
Out of his head
Make him out of his mind.. (out of his mind hehehehe)

Chorus
All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death!
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life
He crawls like a worm...
(crawls like a worm!)
Crawls like a worm from a bird!

Break:

Chanting:
(all aloneee)
Crawls like a worm from a bird
(all aloneee)
Crawls like a worm from a bird
(all aloneee)
Crawls like a worm...
Crawls like a worm from a bird...

Ahhh aaahhhh ooooo oooooo aahhh aaahhh (ahhhh
aaahhhh!)

Now he knows
If he can't relieve it, it grows...
And so it goes...
He crawls like a worm...
(crawls like a worm from the bird)

Prechorus
(out of his mind away)
(pushes him whispering: musta been outta his mind!!!)

Chorus:
All alone he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death!
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life
He crawls like a worm from a bird!

All alone he's
Holding his breath half to death!(holding his breath
half to death)
Terrified to
Save his life
He crawls like a worm (crawls like a worm)
Crawls like a worm (crawls like a worm)
From the bird...
(all aloneee)
Crawls like a worm from the bird
(all aloneee)
Crawls like a worm from the bird
(all aloneee)
Crawls like a worm...
Crawls like a worm...
Crawls like a worm from the bird...
