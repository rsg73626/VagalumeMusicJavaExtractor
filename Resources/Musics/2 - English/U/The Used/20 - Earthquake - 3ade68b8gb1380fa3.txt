EARTHQUAKE

She had an earthquake on her mind 
I almost heard her cry out as I left her far behind 
and knew the world was crashing down around her 

I sink to the ocean floor because I know that we are more but 
I've made this mess 
I built this fire, Are you still mine? 

[refrão]
Cause baby I'm not all right when you go 
I'm not fine, Please be all mine 
I never want you to go because I am all yours so please be all mine.

She had an earthquake on her mind apparently the kind that would 
bury us alive 
by putting all this weight on us forever 
I lie here on the ocean floor broken castle by the shore and 
I made this mess 
I built this fire, Are you still mine? 

[refrão]
Cause baby I'm not all right when you go 
I'm not fine, Please be all mine 
I never want you to go because I am all yours so please be all mine.

Let me save us 
I've slaughtered us, I've murdered our love 
I can taste it, This blood in my mouth 
This knife in my lungs 
Have I murdered our love? 

[refrão]
Cause baby I'm not all right when you go 
I'm not fine, Please be all mine 
I never want you to go because I am all yours so please be all mine.

Cause baby I'm not all right, Cause baby I'm not all right when you go 
I'm not fine, Please be all mine 
I never want you to go because I am all yours so please be all mine.

Please be all mine
