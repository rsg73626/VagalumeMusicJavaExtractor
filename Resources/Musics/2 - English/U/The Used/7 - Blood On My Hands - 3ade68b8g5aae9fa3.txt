BLOOD ON MY HANDS

You Felt the coldness in my eyes 
And something i'm not revealing
Though you got used to my disguise 
You can't shake this awful feeling 

It's the me that i let you know 
And i'll never show 
I have my reasons 

I hate to say that i told you so 
But i told you so 

Chorus:
Theres blood on my hands 
Like the blood in you 
Some things can't be treated so don't make me 
Don't make me  be  myself around you 

Straight from your eyes it's barely me so 
Beautifully so disfigured 
This other side that you can't see 
Just playing you won't remember 

Fell the pain that i never show 
And i hope you know i'ts never healing
I hate to say that i told you so 
But i told you so 

Chorus 2:
There's blood on my hands 
Like the blood in you 
Some things can't be treated so don't make me 
Don't make me be myself around you

Straight from your eyes it's barely me 
so beautifully so disfigured 
This other side that you can't see 
Just playing you won't remember

Chorus:...
