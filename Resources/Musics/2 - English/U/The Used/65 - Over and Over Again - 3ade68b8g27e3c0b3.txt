OVER AND OVER AGAIN

It called me, I shoulda known
As the fever sweat through the dream
Told mamma that I couldn't go
So I could stay home just to watch him dancing
And you could not tell me then
Like you could never ever tell me now
That this is not who I am

Plans were made while my back was turned
Said Baby, That is no way to live
Showed me that carrot on a string but just a little too late
The bite from the taste and the smell of the sick somehow reminds me to be myself
Over and over again

Wanna be startin' somethin' taught me to sing
Or maybe kiss kiss Molly's lips
On a plain he will always live
In a round he will always be dancing
Imagine where I'd be now
On these four legs I stand proud
It's the only way I know how to give
