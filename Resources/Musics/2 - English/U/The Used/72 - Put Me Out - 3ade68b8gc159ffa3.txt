PUT ME OUT

You bought your smile in a corner
You paid a pretty little penny, you did.
You paint yourself in a picture
As you deny the kind of person you've been

You kill what you fear, what you wish to be
You kill with sarcastic sincerity
You sharpened your guilt like a guillotine
You kill what you fear, you kill what you fear

I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.

Come on!

You bought right into the moment,
You paid a pretty little penny, you did.
You never noticed how broken
As you deny the kind of person you've been

You kill what you fear, what you wish to be
You kill with sarcastic sincerity
You sharpened your guilt like a guillotine
You kill what you fear, you kill what you fear

I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.

Fear you kneel to pray
Live life on your knees
Embrace the disease
Stop to breathe me in
As you start to choke
Your new life begins

You put me out! Like a cigarette!
You put me out! Like a cigarette!
You put me out! Like a cigarette!
You put me out! You put me...

I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.

I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.

You put me out!
You put me out!
You put me out!
