I CAUGHT FIRE (IN YOUR EYES)

Seemed to stop my breath
My head on your chest
Waiting to cave in
From the bottom of my...
Here your voice again
Can we dim the sun..
And wonder where we've been.

Maybe you and me so..
Kiss me like you did
My heart stopped beating
Such a softer sin.

I'm Melting.. I'm Melting

(Chorus)
In your eyes..
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I’m melting
In your eyes..
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me, lay with me now.

Never caught my breath
Every second I’m without you, I’m a mess
Ever know each other
Trust these words are stones
Why cuts aren't healing?
Learning how to love
I'm melting, I'm melting

(Chorus)
Stay with me, lay with me now.

You can stay and watch me fall
And of course I’ll ask for...

(Background Scream) Help......

Just stay with me now
We can take our pants off, stay in bed
Just make love, that's all
Just stay with me now

I'm melting, I'm melting

(Chorus x2)
(Background on 2nd Chorus) Stay with me, lay with me

In your eyes
Let's sleep till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes
I'm melting in your eyes
Let's sleep till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes
