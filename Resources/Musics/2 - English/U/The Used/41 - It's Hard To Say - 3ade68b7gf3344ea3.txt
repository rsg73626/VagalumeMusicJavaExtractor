IT'S HARD TO SAY

The singer finished singing and she's walking out
The singer sheds a tear fear of falling out
and it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by, and I cried

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same

My worries weigh the world how I used to be
And everything i'm cold seems a plague in me
And it's hard to say how I feel today 
For years gone by, and I cried

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say I have my time
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone, it's not the same

Worse than the fear 
Is the lie you told a thousand times before
Worse than the fear, it's the knife
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by, and I cried

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say I have my time
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say (god it's hard to say)
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
