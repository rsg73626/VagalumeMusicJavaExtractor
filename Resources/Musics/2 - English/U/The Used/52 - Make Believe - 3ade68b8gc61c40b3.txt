MAKE BELIEVE

I can't see
What it is that you want me to see
Let alone could I ever believe
there is only one way to be
And somehow you were given the key
I was just a little kid
I put my trust in you
You never meant to lie
You didn't know the truth
You don't get to tell me what to do anymore
You don't get to tell me how to live anymore

I don't need to keep my head out of the clouds
I don't need to keep my feet upon the ground
I am never buying what you're selling
To me it's only make believe
I don't need a map to find my way back home
I don't need a book to teach me how to love
Don't tell me that you know the ending
To me it's only make believe

I won't do
What it is that you tell me to do
I have seen what you had to go through
Not what I had expected from you
I guess I had expected the truth
I was just a little kid
Thought you could teach me how to live
I put my trust in you
All I got was the rules
You don't get to tell me what to do anymore
You don't get to tell me how to live anymore
