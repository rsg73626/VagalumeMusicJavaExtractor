KISS IT GOODBYE

Your love shows many colours
Roses will show their thorns
You showed me signs of silence
Showed me my way back home
I break my back right over
I dance on broken glass
I hold my breath half to death
You can't forget the past

Unless you think it's not over
Let's kiss it goodbye
Is it really worth it?
Is it all just a lie?
Not like I'm giving up now 
I am willing to try
Unless you think it's not over
Let's kiss it goodbye
Come on come on!

You break your back right over
You can't on broken glass
Although you'll always love me
You can't forget the past

Unless you think it's not over
Let's kiss it goodbye
Is it really worth it?
Is it all just a lie?
Not like I'm giving up now
I am willing to try
Unless you think it's not over
Let's kiss it goodbye

My love shows many colours
Devils will show them horns
I lead you into darkness
Hoping will lead us home

You break your back right over
You can't on broken glass
Although you'll always love me
You can't forget the past
