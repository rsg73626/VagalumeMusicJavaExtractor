FORCE WITHOUT SILENCE

Or maybe copulate
I'll try to articulate
Go find seclusion
Try self reproduction
Autogamy's nation
Epidemic inflationour voices steal silence
The plans that we've made
The dead cannot hear all the prayers that we beg
Is there force without violence (?)
Is there a catch with no hook
Believing the lies while they fix all the books
Things will never change
If we remain the same
Our hearts call us by name

These walls won't keep us safe
When they hold us back like barricades
It's our time to replace these walls
The walls around our hearts
There is no price we won't pay
And we'll steal it back just to give it away
It's our time to replace these walls
The walls around our hearts

When fear breaks the silence the choice has been made
We're listening now to the sounds from the grave
This brave opposition comes naturally
Being exactly who we're supposed to be
Things will never change
If we remain the same
Our hearts call us by name

Won't take what we're given
Won't pay pray for our freedom

(I don't have to say fuck you
When I can say fornicate

Stroking your soaking
And slippery faith
Keep pulling hard
Till you cover your face
Don't have to call you a dick
When I can say hypocrite
Treacherous hideous
Ridiculous phallus
Erected insidious
Meddling mischievous
Hyper-banal
Intellectual syphilis
Keeping to crusty philosophy's clever
Standing out just like the rest
Just a member.)
