DARK DAYS

As in the way that the sun spits in your face
Our love is too big for us to break
You've got me wishing for the stars and outer space
I'm holding onto this life and love for
The possibility
You and me
Let me be

I need to find a way
To put this trouble behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

As in the way that the rain spits in your face
Just falling apart your lips to taste
It's like I give to you the stars and out of space
I'm holding onto this life and love for
The possibility
You and me
Let me be

I need to find a way
To put this trouble behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

Another time and place
Could put this trouble behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

So far away
So far away
Look into your heart
Let time beat this pace
We're not so far away

The possibility
You and me
Let me be

I need to find a way
To put this trouble behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

Another time and place
Could put this trouble behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark
Light of these dark
Light of these dark days
