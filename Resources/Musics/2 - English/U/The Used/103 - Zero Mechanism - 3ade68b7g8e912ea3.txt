ZERO MECHANISM

it takes more, it takes more
it takes more
and now that i'm willing to beg
now it stands right in front of me
dig this dirt out from under my nails
and I feel this, picture my face
sad to say not today
it just, it takes more

it takes more, it takes more, 
it takes more, takes more
it destroys me, i'm sitting here
it destroys me, i'm just sitting here
destorys me, i'm sitting here
it destroys me, i'm sitting here

it destroys me, i'm sitting here
it destroys me, i'm just sitting here
destroys me, i'm sitting here
it destroys me, i'm just sitting here

and it stands right in front of me
dig this dirt out from under my nails
and I feel this, picture my face
its sad to say not today
it just, it takes more

i'm just sitting here more
and picture my face, it takes more
its sad to say, i feel this way
it takes...
