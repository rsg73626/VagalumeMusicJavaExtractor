WATERED DOWN

In my eyes, coarse and jaded,
it's no surprise the lights have faded.
I always walk away,
you'll always hear me say: ?I don't need this.?

I've been given such a gift,
shame to take advantage of it.
Wanted wasting leaves you wanting more,
be careful what you're wishing for.

Nothing that I can hold onto with my broken hands,
I'm not thinking that I should anyway.
So I leave holding nothing. 
Don't care what you say,
'cause it makes no difference if I throw it away.
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away.

Now my days are feeling numbered.
The sad cliche I'm hiding under,
this spiderweb of dreams,
I'm stuck here as it seems to be breaking.

Shining brighter than you burn,
something that I would never learn.
I could never lay this curse on you,
cursing the days where there's

nothing that I can hold onto with my broken hands.
I'm not thinking that I should anyway.
So I leave holding nothing. 
Don't care what you say,
'cause it makes no difference if I throw it away.

'Cause it makes no difference.
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away.
It makes no difference,
it makes no difference if I throw it away.
Makes no difference if I throw it away.

It all just ends up tasting watered down.
It's never been so complicated,
and everyone has found an easy way out,
an easy way out.

Nothing that I can hold onto with my broken hands,
I'm not thinking that I should anyway.
So I leave holding nothing. 
Don't care what you say,
'cause it makes no difference if I throw it away.
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away.
