I'M A FAKE

Small, simple, safe price.
Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets.
This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals.
And I am not afraid to die.
I'm not afraid to bleed, and fuck, and fight.
I want the pain of payment.
What's left, but a section of pigmy size cuts.
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks.
Would you be my little cut?
Would you be my thousand fucks?
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid.
To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts.
My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter.
I'm cutting trying to picture your black broken heart.
Love is not like anything.
Especially a fucking knife.

Look at me, you cant tell
By the way I move and do my hair
Do you think, that it's me?
Or it's not me I don't even care.
I'm alive
I don't smell
I'm the cleanest i have ever been
I feel big, i feel tall, i feel dry...DRY!

Just look at me, look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).
Just look at me, look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).

Do i drink?Do i date?
I've got perfect placement all my ink
satisfied in your eyes
i'm the biggest fan i've got right now
i made sure that i look how i wanted to look
the people around me 
the people surround me
i feel big, i feel tall, i feel dry...DRY!

Just look at me, look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).
Just look at me, look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).

My stomach hurts now,
and all tied off in lace
i pray i beg for anything 
to hit me in the face
and this sickness isn't me 
and i pray to fall from grace
the last thing i see is feeling
And i'm telling you i'm a fake

And i'm telling you i'm a fake 
And i'm telling you i'm a fake 
And i'm telling you i'm a fake 
And i'm telling you!

Just look at me, look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).
Just look at me, look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).
Just look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake).
Just look at me now.
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake).

Fake, fake
i'm telling you i'm a
FAKE!!!
