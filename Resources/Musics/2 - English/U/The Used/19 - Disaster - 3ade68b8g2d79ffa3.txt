DISASTER

If you need me I'll be out with the night
If you need me I'll be up with the moon
Watch me changing as you turn out the light
Watch me changing as I leave your cacoon

I'm like a ghost, a vampire in the mirror
Your the leech that's waiting to feed
Lord of the flies you think that you are the leader
Fix a pig and watch it bleed

How can I change when your the disaster
(disaster you fucking disaster)
How can I let go I'm not holding on
(disaster you fucking disaster)
Every time I stand here you pull me down
Down
How can I change when your the disaster
(disaster you fucking disaster)

Because you need me like a throat needs a knife
Your the cross and I am jesus christ
I am the corpse you are the maggots inside me
Now it's time to give up the fight

Cut it out get the abortion
Cut it up just eat my organs
Do it up cut through the bull shit
Making love to her cadaver
That's it I have to stab her
My heart can't get much blacker
Ha ha

How can I change when your the disaster
(disaster you fucking disaster)
How can I let go I'm not holding on
(disaster you fucking disaster)
Every time I stand here you pull me down
Down
How can I change when your the disaster
(disaster you fucking disaster)

Disaster
Coming all the things you outta
You'd think I don't know
I'm a bastard
You got me started
But what do I know

Whoa oh oh oh ah
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh ah
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh ah ah
Whoa oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh ah oh

How can I change when your the disaster
(disaster you fucking disaster)
How can I let go I'm not holding on
(disaster you fucking disaster)
Every time I stand here you pull me down
Down
How can I change when your the disaster
(disaster you fucking disaster)

Disaster
