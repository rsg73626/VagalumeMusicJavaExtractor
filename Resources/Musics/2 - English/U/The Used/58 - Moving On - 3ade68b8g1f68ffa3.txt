MOVING ON

I might have so far to go
And the moments left behind
I started gasping for air
Got that, I'm still breathing
Swallow the pain,
I thought I didn't need it, didn't need it at all
When I watch the cut heal,
I know my heart is still beating

It's safe to say that nothing lasts forever
Just like I can not escape tomorrow
We'll keep moving on
We'll feel the start until we see what we've become
When that's the left for us to follow
We'll keep moving on

Might not have so far to go
Just to leave the me≈°s behind
(leave the mess behind)
I see the sun coming up
I know it's worth believing
Have you lost my mind?
Have you lost the feeling?
It's been there all along
It makes me feel strong to know my heart's still beating

It's safe to say that nothing lasts forever
Just like I can not escape tomorrow
We'll keep moving on
We'll feel the start until we see what we've become
When that's the left for us to follow
We'll keep moving on
We'll keep moving on

Feel the beat of my broken heart
Feel the beat as we're moving on
Feel the beat of my broken heart
Feel the beat as we're moving on

It's getting awkward, faith will survive
So feel the beat of my broken heart
It's getting old we've been here for so long
So feel the beat of my broken heart

It's safe to say that nothing lasts forever
Just like I can not escape tomorrow
We'll keep moving on
We'll feel the start until we see what we've become
When that's the left for us to follow
We'll keep moving on
We'll keep moving on
