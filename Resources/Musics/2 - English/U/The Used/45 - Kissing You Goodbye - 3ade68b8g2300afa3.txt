KISSING YOU GOODBYE

Cut yourself in conversation,
cut the line to make me feel alive,
'cause u know I'm not alive,
and leave me with your complications.
Take your life, you feel like taking mine.
Meeting God, we stand in line,
not alone.

Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving, not going.
I'm not kissing you goodbye.
On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding.
I'm not kissing you goodbye.

Trust you'll take the right to leave me.
Waiting under dark clouds for the grave,
creating lightning strikes a change
as history gets lost and
as I took that final breathe I felt alive
Meeting god, we stand in line,
all alone.

Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving, not going.
I'm not kissing you goodbye.
On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding.
I'm not kissing you goodbye.

Don't let me go,
don't say goodbye,
'cause you know that I'm not alive.
Don't let me go,
don't say goodbye,
don't let this love die.
Don't let me go,
(cut yourself in conversation)
don't say goodbye,
(cut the line to make me feel alive)
'cause you know I'm not alive.
('cause you know I'm not alive)
Don't let me go,
(and leave me with your complications)
don't say goodbye,
(take your life, you feel like taking mine)
don't let this love die.

Nowhere to go, (I'm not going, I'm not leaving)
I'm not leaving, (I'm not going)
not going.
I'm not kissing you goodbye. (not going)
On my own, (not leaving)
I'm nothing, (not going)
just bleeding.
I'm not kissing you goodbye,
I'm not kissing you goodbye,
I'm not kissing you goodbye.
