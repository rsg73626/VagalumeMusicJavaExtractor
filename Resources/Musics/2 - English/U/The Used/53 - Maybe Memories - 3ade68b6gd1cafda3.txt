MAYBE MEMORIES

As we trudge along through the mud 
And we tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, 
not at all
Not for one 
for one, for one second

Never have been one to write it down
Now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now
Who's looking south
not me. I'm looking back.
I'm done denying the truth to anyone 
cause I'm alive. 

As we trudge along through the mud 
And we tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, 
not at all
Not for one 
for one, for one second

You showed me how. 
You seemed to find a hole
but I just laughed and smiled
Begged and rolled my eyes
Even cried 
And denied the truth to you
just like the truth to me
mostly lied. 

I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back

White it out 
Like glittering 
Wax butterflies

Never have been one to write it down
Now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now
Who's looking south
nnot me. I'm looking back.
I'm done denying the truth to anyone 
cause I'm alive. 

I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
