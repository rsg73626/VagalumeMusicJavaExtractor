KENNA SONG

Can a song?
Shine a light on what we think?
Can a song?
Move the people to their feet?
Can a song leave us brave enough to fight?
Can a song ever help us get it right?
We have the right to let our voices be heard

Hear us now
Hear us screaming out
We feel it breaking down
I bet you can hear us now
No more secrets
No more fear
I bet you can hear us now
I bet you can hear us now

Sing a song. change a world that doesn't care
Sing a song. stop the only ones who dare
Sing a song. Feed the ones who need it more
Sing a song
Bring the soldiers back from war
We have the right to let our voices be heard

We stand together, set in stone, hearts open wide
And leave them no place left to hide
It's not a bridge, it's their ideas we must burn
You've had your chance now it's our turn
