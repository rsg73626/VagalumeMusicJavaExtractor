FIND A WAY

Lay your head down just for now 
Space fills your mind you dream awhile 
The sun floods your room as you drown your 
Lungs full of breathing 
Your true love believe 

One more time to say I love you always 
and keeping faith letting love find a way

Move let the stars suck you in 
Hold tight, the night's air and breathe again 
Let go and be burnt by the moon 
Your hands full of feeling your true love, Believe 

One more time to say I love you always 
and keeping faith letting love find a way

One more time to say I love you always 
and keeping faith letting love find a way

I love you to death 
Do you love me to death? 
I love you to death 
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

One more time to say I love you always 
and keeping faith letting love find a way

One more time to say I love you always 
and keeping faith letting love find a way
letting love find a way
letting love find a way
letting love
