EMPTY WITH YOU

I haven't lost anything except my mind,
(except my mind)
Expect a thousand confessions that you will not find.
I try to take off my head sometimes,
because I can't escape the memories.
I haven't lost anything except my mind.
(except my mind)

You could be empty, and I can be right here,
empty with you.
Or you could be hollow, and I can be right here,
hollow with you.
If you want to say goodbye to everything,
I could say goodbye too.
I could be right here, empty, with you.

I haven't wasted a thing except my time,
(except my time)
Forget the treasures we've burned 'cause we'll be just fine.
I try to take off my head sometimes,
because I can't escape for the life of me.
I haven't lost a thing except my mind
(except my mind)

You could be empty, and I can be right here,
empty with you.
Or you could be hollow, and I can be right here,
hollow with you.
If you want to say goodbye to everything,
I could say goodbye too.
I could be right here, empty, with you.

Instead of going underground,
instead of calling them out,
instead of running,
'cause you`re still breathing.

Instead of swallowing lies,
instead of buried alive,
let's push the knife down,
they can't stop bleeding.

If you need a confession, I'm guilty.
(Let's push the knife down, they can't stop bleeding)
Do you think I feel sorry? Forgive me.
(Let's push the knife down, they can't stop bleeding)

Instead of going underground,
instead of calling them out,
let's twist the knife, now,
they can't stop bleeding.

You could be empty, and I can be right here,
empty with you.
Or you could be hollow, and I can be right here,
hollow with you.
If you want to say goodbye to everything,
I could say goodbye too.
I could be right here, empty, with you.
