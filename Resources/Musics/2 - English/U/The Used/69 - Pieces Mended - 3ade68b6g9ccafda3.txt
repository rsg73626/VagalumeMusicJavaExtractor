PIECES MENDED

PIECES MENDED 

Being faced with what I'm faced with I feel
Like I can't rock
Like a rock hit my heart
Started to chain the day
And exploded into pieces

Marry me
Stay the same
Lie to me and try to say you never will

Marry me
Stay the same
Lie to me and try to tell me

I've got a feeling in my gut now fills me
With so much hope
Said fuck it I'm fine
Dine and dashed
The pianist peddled into morning, morning

Marry me
Stay the same
Lie to me and try to say you never will

Marry me
Stay the same
Lie to me and try to say you never

Morning, Morning

Being faced with what I'm faced with I feel
Like I can't rock
Like a rock hit my heart
Started to chain the day
And exploded into pieces

Pieces[x6]
(Being faced with what I'm faced with I feel
Like I can't rock
Like a rock hit my heart
Started to chain the day
And exploded into pieces)

As of now I'm down straight up
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Or a box for a piece 
Or a box for a smoke
But they're all gonna choke me 
As of now I'm down straight up
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Or a box for a piece 
Or a box for a smoke
But they're all gonna choke me

You're so crazy
Your'e so crazy
Your'e so crazy 
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me 

It's like a fucking drug deal 
I'm sitting here waiting 
I'm calling you back 
and you won't call me back 
and it's fucked up, but at the same time it just made me want you even worse. 

For awhile I was cleaner than now
Then I started to destroy myself
With things that I love now the things that I hate
Until it finally broke me 

You're so crazy 
You're so crazy 
You're so crazy 
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me

Fuck my ass
Fuck my ass
Choke me 
Choke me 
Choke me 

As of now I'm down straight up
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Or a box for a piece 
Or a box for a smoke
But they're all gonna choke me

You're so crazy 
You're so crazy
You're so crazy
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me
