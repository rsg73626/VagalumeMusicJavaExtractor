BURIED MYSELF ALIVE

You almost always pick the best time, to drop the worst lines. 
You almost made me cry again this time, 
Another false alarm, red flashing lights, 
Well this time I´m not going to watch myself die. 
I think I made it a game to play your game and let myself cry, 
Buried myself alive on the inside. 
So I could shut you out, and let you go away for a long time. 

I guess it´s okay I puke the day away. 
I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way. 
And if you want me back, 
You´re gonna have to ask 

I think the chain broke away, 
And I felt it the day that I had my own time. 
I took advantage of myself and felt fine. 
But it was worth the night, 
I caught an early flight and I made it home. 

I guess it´s okay I puke the day away. 
I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way. 
And if you want me back, 
You´re gonna have to ask nicer than that, nicer than that. 

With my foot on your neck, I finally have you 

Right where I want you. (4x) 

I guess it´s okay I puke the day away. 
I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way [your own way] 
And if you want me back, 
You´re gonna have to ask nicer than that, nicer than that. 

(overlaps) I guess it´s okay I puked the day away. 
I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way. 
And if you want me back, 
You´re gonna have to ask nicer than that 
Nicer! THAN THAT! 
Nicer!THAN THAT!
