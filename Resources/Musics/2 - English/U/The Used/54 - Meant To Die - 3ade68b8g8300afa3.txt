MEANT TO DIE

Past midnight, breathing in the dark.
Same strange friend comes to visit,
never intend to open the door.

You take it to places that no one's ever been,
you let it, you let it, your insides caving in.
You pushed and pulled, still wanting some more.

This time I've gone all the way without you,
there's nothing more I can say.

So maybe I took a little too much,
maybe life didn't want this part of me.
It it helps to know, I never let you go.
Sure, I lost my mind,
but I never really meant to die.

Last heartbeat's fading in the night,
only expecting darkness.
Surprised to wake and follow the light.

The second you let it become a part of you,
you'll never forget it, no matter what you do.
You lost it all, still wanting some more.

This time I've gone all the way without you,
there's nothing more I can say.

So maybe I took a little too much,
maybe life didn't want this part of me.
It it helps to know, I never let you go.
I'm sorry that I lost my mind.

So baby, I took a little too much,
maybe you sucked the life right out of me.
I should have let you know I never meant to go.
Sure I lost my mind, but I never really meant to die.

Never stay forever,
never stay forever,
come on.

Never stay forever,
never stay forever,
come on.

So maybe I took a little too much,
maybe life didn't want this part of me.
It it helps to know, I never let you go.
I'm sorry that I lost my mind.

So baby, I took a little too much,
maybe you sucked the life right out of me.
I should have let you know I never meant to go.
Sure I lost my mind, but I never really meant to die.
