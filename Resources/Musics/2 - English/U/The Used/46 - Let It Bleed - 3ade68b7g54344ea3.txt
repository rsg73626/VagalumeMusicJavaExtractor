LET IT BLEED

This poison’s my intoxication 
I broke the needle off in my skin 
Picked the scabs and picked the bleeding
And assume that it was all in vain 
A positive scab that's never healing 
Calloused hit me in the face 
A burning bridge that's so misleading 
Poison’s more potent now with the flame

Let it bleed 
And take the red for what it's worth 
Watch the fire 
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time 
If you feel like dying, you might wanna’ sing. 

The fire department couldn't drown the city 
They didn't even try to wash it clean 
What did you think, that I was sober? 
Put me out ‘cause I'm on fucking fire 
A positive scab that's never healing 
Regret that I kept this clean 
The most that I can do for you is keep on lying 
It's not a lie if you can let it sing 

Let it bleed 
And take the red for what it's worth 
Watch the fire 
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time 
If you feel like dying you might wanna’ sing! 

Oh, oh, oh, oh you might wanna’ sing 
Ha, ha, ha you might wanna’ sing 
Ha, ha, you might wanna’ sing 
Ha, ha sing 
You might wanna’ sing 
You might wanna’ sing 
You might wanna sing or scream it...

This poison’s my intoxication 
I broke the needle off in my skin 
Picked the scabs and picked the bleeding 
Yeah, assume that it was all in vain 

Let it bleed 
And take the red for what it's worth 
Watch the fire 
Momma fill your lungs with smoke for the last time 
If you feel like dying 
If you feel like dying 
If you feel like dying, you might wanna’ sing 
Ha, ha, ha you might wanna’ sing 
Ha, ha you might wanna’ sing 
You might wanna sing or scream it...
