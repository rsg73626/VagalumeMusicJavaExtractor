801 UNDERGROUND

Kids round here got a different way of doin' it
lock into a dream and insist on pursuin' it
Times are getting tougher and the choice is do or die
We play it fuckin loud, how we want and reply
So turn up the stereo and grab the mic
cause I know I'm alright
got my friends on the side
so stand up stand tall
let 'em know who you are
We're the band, 
we're the band (who's) gonna sing 
Here we goooooo 
Who said LA is the only place that music can rock?
Throwin' it like a gun and we're ready to correct 'em
We hit the stage and we tear it up like dynamite
The music stays tight people goin' through the night
The people stand around in a state of confusion
This place is distorted and we're ready to confess itwe aim to please and we seek to fuckin' kill
And the ones underground ain't goin' down, never will

We are the underground
And you can't shut us down
Cause we come from underground
Ain't nothin' gonna hold us down
