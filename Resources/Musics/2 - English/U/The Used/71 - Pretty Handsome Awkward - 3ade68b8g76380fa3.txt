PRETTY HANDSOME AWKWARD

Kickin' it out

Your dream vacation is my hostage refuge
A work in progress you bleed
Just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ, make me an offer
Walks on the rain you bleed
Just like you puke while running a mile

Hey, are you okay? (okay)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay? (okay)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

Your market value your ressurrection
your shallow concept
help yourself
I hope you choke and you die
I know you meant it nice fucking disguise so hollow
embrace the burn you bleed just like you puke while
running a mile

Do you feel okay? (okay)
You look pretty low
Pretty low, pretty low
Pretty handsome awkward

Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Pretty low, pretty low
(handsome awkward)
Pretty handsome awkward

(handsome awkward)

kickin' it out [x3]

Pretty low!
