SURRENDER

Started out as a feeling
But the feeling started to grow
I get stuck in the meaning
And the answer's beyond my control

I could to the edge in the middle of the dark
Hold my breath, take a step, feel it all fall apart
'Cause I know exactly who you are
And I know just what you're doing to me, it's over (it's over)

Broken you found me
My angel, my shoulder
To leave us where and
I'm with you
I feel like I'll live forever

This moment
Feelings exploding
My heart beats alive
Now it's true
I'm giving up I surrender

So afraid of the feeling
So afraid of what I had to show
Broken down so completely
And there's nothing I had to let go

I could to the edge in the middle of the dark
Hold my breath, take a step, felt it all fall apart
'Cause I know exactly who you are
And I know just what you're doing to me, it's over (it's over)

Broken you found me
My angel, my shoulder
To leave us where and
I'm with you
I feel like I'll live forever
This moment
Feelings exploding
My heart beats alive
Now it's true
I'm giving up I surrender

Broken you found me
My angel, my shoulder
To leave us where and
I'm with you
I feel like I'll live forever
This moment
Feelings exploding
My heart beats alive
Now it's true
I'm giving up I surrender

Broken you found me
My angel, my shoulder
To leave us where and
I'm with you
I feel like I'll live forever
This moment
Feelings exploding
My heart beats alive
Now it's true
I'm giving up I surrender

Started out as a feeling
But the feeling started to grow
I get stuck in the meaning
And the answer's beyond my control
