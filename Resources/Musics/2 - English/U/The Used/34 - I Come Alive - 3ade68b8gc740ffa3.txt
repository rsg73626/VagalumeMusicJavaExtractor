I COME ALIVE

Breathing in now, I try counting my blessings
Picturing the last time I fed, beg forgiveness
With some words that mean nothing,
Illusions like smoke in the breath

I come alive, when I'm falling down
I let myself go, til I hit the ground
When I'm there, at the edge
In this moment I'm feeling alone
Come alive when I'm falling down

Air is thin now, while my lung's collapsing
Vertigo blankets my head, far from reckless
When I'm comfortable,
So that I know I could never forget

I come alive, when I'm falling down
I let myself go, til I hit the ground
When I'm there, at the edge
In this moment I'm feeling alone
Come alive when I'm falling down

Keep your distance, far away from me
Watch this eat me alive
Keep your distance, far away from me
Watch this eat me alive

I come alive, when I'm falling down
I let myself go, til I hit the ground
When I'm there, at the edge
In this moment I'm feeling alone
Come alive when I'm falling down

I come alive
I come alive
I come alive
I come alive
I come alive
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
(I come alive)
(I come alive)
(I come alive)
