SOLD MY SOUL

I think of the worm that I've become,
left blind from the brightness of your halo.
No-one shines like you do.

My filthy mouth and broken words,
this small disease that leaves me crawling,
crawling to you.

Crawl underground for comfort,
stay close to the dirt to keep me from falling,
from falling.

Sold my life to bring the rain,
maybe to wash me clean.
Sold my soul to stop the pain,
hoping you'd set me free.

All your fear,
all your shame,
you know that you can lay it all on me,
you can lay it all on me.

I took every chance to lash my tongue,
you wore the scabs just like an angel;
There's something about you.

Horrible things that I have done,
seems this disease is slowly spreading.
Start running, what would you do?

Crawl underground for comfort,
stay out of my mind to keep from dying,
from dying.

Sold my life to bring the rain,
maybe to wash me clean.
Sold my soul to stop the pain,
hoping you'd set me free.

All your fear,
all your shame,
you know that you can lay it all on me,
you know that you can lay it all on me.

Could you forget then what I said,
and how I died inside my head.
We're starting over, not pretending that the past is dead.

And the pain you feel you owe,
all the times I should have known,
don't keep it inside, let it out and lay it all on me.

Sold my life to bring the rain,
maybe to wash me clean.
Sold my soul to stop the pain,
hoping you'd set me free.

All your fear,
all the pain,
you know that you can lay it all on me,
you can lay it all on me.
