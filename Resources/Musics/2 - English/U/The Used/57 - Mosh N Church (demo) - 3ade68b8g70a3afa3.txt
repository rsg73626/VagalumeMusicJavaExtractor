MOSH N CHURCH (DEMO)

First start out with the wrong place at the right time
And that's where you'll find me.
Next add in all the fucked up shit I've done
But somehow kept inside me.

Cause while you were waiting for the sun I was turning away,
You try avoiding death by kneeling to pray,
You don't know if it's true,
But you heard there was a fire and I'm drowning in the rain.

I throw my hands up to the sky just to watch them burn,
There's no one there that you know,
That's why I'm headed below.

Once dreaming only burning wasn't quite
A part of us in every all.
Just me and my diesease I knew it was a dream
It got too cold to let go.

Cause while you were waiting for the sun I was turning away,
You try avoiding death by kneeling to pray,
You don't know if it's true,
But you heard there was a fire and I'm drowning in the rain.

I throw my hands up to the sky just to watch them burn,
There's no-one there that you know,
(Burn them) That's why I'm headed below.

Count all this blood on my hands,
To get me in.
Save all the sins you can't stand,
To cash them in.

Just to get me in,
Just to get me in!

I throw my hands up to the sky just to watch them burn,
There's no-one there that you know,

I throw my hands up to the sky just to watch them burn,
There's no-one there that you know,
(Burn them) That's why I'm headed below.
