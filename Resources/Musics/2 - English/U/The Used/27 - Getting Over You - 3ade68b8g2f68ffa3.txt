GETTING OVER YOU

I still remember
All the back and forth
You couldn't stay away
And I couldn't take it
Like a cold wind blows
You're calling out your name

And now it haunts me
Softly fading
Are the memories of your face
I should have listened
When you whispered my name
Still you couldn't say

Cause you couldn't say goodbye
Now I cannot ask you why
Although our time is through
No getting over you

Things will never be the same
I can't even say your name
I know our time is through
No getting over you

(no getting over you)

I still remember
As you walked the moon
To stay out of the way
Memories burning
Like the cigarettes, likes the ashes
Call your name

Lasting a moment
When you packed your bags
And said you couldn't say
Letter and a message
That I never read
You're calling out my name

Cause you couldn't say goodbye
Now I cannot ask you why
Although our time is through
No getting over you

I will never be the same
I can't even say your name
I know our time is through
No getting over you

You know my heart still pumps my blood
All the same
It's over, there's not starting over
(I will live on)
Although your memory lives on
All the same
It's over, (its over)
There no starting over, no starting over

I still remember
All the back and forth
You couldn't stay away
And I couldn't take it
Like a cold wind blows
You're calling out your name

Cause you couldn't say goodbye
Now I cannot ask you why
Although our time is through
No getting over you

I will never be the same
I can't even say your name
I know our time is through
No getting over you

No getting over you
No getting over you
