SOMETHING SAFE

Been hanging desperate and hoping for a break.
Black metal heavy till it goes against my brains.
Why do I disgrace those things that spreads right off my face,
All this for you.

He almost thought he had a chance for something safe,
But she can't let go, she won't shut up.
(Like someone put a gun to his face?)

Your way of crawling away, of caring way too much.
Plus public buildings, my pistol says enough?
Your only weapon, put on the piano I'm feeling slow.
All this for you

But she can't let go, she won't shut up.

She almost thought she had a place to hide her face,
Like she thinks they care, they just don't care.
