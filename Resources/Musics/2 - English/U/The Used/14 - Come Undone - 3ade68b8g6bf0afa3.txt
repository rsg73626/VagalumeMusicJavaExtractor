COME UNDONE

Opened up my failure, and you refused to go insane
I felt you get excited when I whispered all the things you love to hate
You're the one who kills
You could kill me with the drug, your weapon
Let's pretend there's nothing wrong with learning to listen

(Bang bang) I'll be your, loaded gun
(Bang bang) We need to come undone
I'll stay right beside you, to watch you burn
(Bang bang) I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve

Open lacerations, a slower cut to feel your pain
Heat the blood to boiling as it passes from your lips into your brain
Cuz you're the one who kills, could kill me with the drug, your weapon
Let's pretend, that I'm not dead, it's in you're head!

(Bang bang) I'll be your, your loaded gun
(Bang bang) We need to come undone
I'll stay right beside you, to watch you burn
(Bang bang) I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve
I'll be the end that you deserve!

I can tell you're warm like fire
Spent my life deep inside you
Keep you alive and watch you, crawl up right beside me!

I'll be your,
I'll be your,
I'll be your,
I'll be the end that you deserve
I'll be the end that you deserve

(Bang bang) I'll be your, loaded gun
(Bang bang) We need to come undone
I'll stay right beside you, to watch you burn
(Bang bang) I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve

I'll be the end that you deserve
