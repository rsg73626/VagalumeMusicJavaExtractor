IT COULD BE A GOOD EXCUSE

Blind on a ledge, not a thing, not a...
Road of broken heart, not a thing. Not at at all.
You know...

Of things we hear, nothing's there.. nothing.
She said "Why do you watch me?" said 'why?'
You know..

Maybe a good excuse not to give a fuck. But I... Care. For You. Said alright. Could be a good excuse. 

Full of love, just returned, just when.. 
You lied, it hurt and your pride... your pride. 
Hurt. Pride. 

And it is... not a thing...not a...you. It hurt. Nothing. And me. It is...these games.. are nothing.

Maybe a good excuse not to give a fuck. But I... But I... But I... But I... But I don't want you. And don't want me. These. games. are nothing.
