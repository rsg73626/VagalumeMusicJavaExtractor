SUN COMES UP

And it all falls down at once.
Gonna try to get some sleep.
And the comforts of this bed...
Have all been shattered to pieces.

I had a knack for feeling lost.
All those times I couldn't eat.
Like I could barely love.
Getting tired of screaming.
(Tired of screaming)

The sun comes up,
and now you have a chance again.
The world falls down,
we all forget where to begin.
The world collapses.
And you hold it in...

Maybe I have said too much.
Or really haven't said enough.
All these words, they come undone.
I'm getting lost in the meaning.

And the coldness in my thoughts.
Of being frozen all alone.
In a world that we destroyed...
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.

The sun comes up,
and now you have a chance again.
The world falls down,
we all forget where to begin.
The world collapses.
You hold it in...

The sun comes up,
and now you have a chance again.

All you've lost...
Leave yourself, you drift away, and your eyes
open as you catch me,
caught before I hit the ground now
I'm dying for you. hold me.
My feeling is forever, happens
All at once, all at once.

The sun comes up,
and now you have a chance again.
The world falls down,
we all forget where to begin.
The world collapses.
You hold it in...

The world collapses.
You hold it in...

The sun comes up,
and now you have a chance again.
