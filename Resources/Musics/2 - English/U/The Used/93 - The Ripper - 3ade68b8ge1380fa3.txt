THE RIPPER

Time Kills, Go ask Jesus 
I'm done, makes no difference 
Stare straight, stare at the sun 
I'm done, makes no difference 

Time takes us all 
So why am I not just living for today 
Time takes us, time takes us all 
Will I die right now, I'm only seconds away 
Time takes us.

Move on, gone forever 
I'm done, makes no difference 
Poison time kills slowly you're done 
Makes no difference 

Time takes us all 
So why am I not just living for today 
Time takes us, time takes us all 
Will I die right now, I'm only seconds away 
Time takes us.

Time will now be
Time will now be
Time will now be
Time will now be the chopping block 
Leave my head 
Time will now be the chopping block, so
Leave my head 
Leave my head 
Leave my head 

AHHHH

Time kills 
Makes no difference
I'm done
Makes no difference

Time takes us all 
So why am I not just living for today 
Time takes us, time takes us all 
Will I die right now, I'm only seconds away 
Time takes us.

Time take US all.
