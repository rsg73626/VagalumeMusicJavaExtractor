MOIST SILVER

So close your eyes
your christ is gone
the cripple boy that you once knew
the charm to make my chosen one

the painted lips,
skin ripped and torn
come touch the feel and lick and smell
the scent of what I've worn so well

Everybody wants,
everybody says,
everbody begs
in time.

So drink me in
like tainted wine
go back down on my shopping cart
and taste the dreams that are known to mine

a simple word
a homeless glare
that binds me with the finished thread
and brings me down to pleasures bed

Everybody wants,
everybody says,
everbody begs
in time.

You will be the first to ball
and the feeling will be told

We are! Moist silver

Morphine may be spinal ground
and you rest into my breast

We are! Moist silver

A giant poised
the feel regrets
a jouvious cure, a complex thrill
a memory i wont soon forget

washed out main
to low ones drive
the touch the feel and lick and smell
the earch that only you could sell

Everybody wants,
everybody says,
everbody begs
in time.

You will be the first to ball
and the feeling will disolve

We are! Moist silver

Morphine may be spinal ground
and its smothered into my breast

We are! Moist silver

take,take it all this time
oh, who do i want to follow

Everybody wants,
everybody says,
everbody begs
in time.

You will be the first to ball
and the feeling will disolve

We are! Moist silver

Morphine may be spinal ground
and its smothered into your breast

we are! Moist silver! Silver!
Silver! We are! moist silver!
Silver! We are! Moist silver!
