SLIT YOUR OWN THROAT

Slit Your Own Throat


I gotta take this moment
Just to put you down
Spin you around with my foot on the back of you head
Up on the curb with the pressure on your teeth
Not gonna take this
Not gonna take this

I watched the rain make a puddle to get you soaked
The swollen words they crack coming out of your throat
A sticky time for the shadow believer
Not gonna take this
Not gonna take this

I swear your head is bigger than us all getting bigger
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat
You're more turned on than anyone could be
By yourself
Go Slit Your Own Throat
Slit your own throat

just like a tick like an itch in the back of your throat
you missed the beat while they're hanging on every note
you're gonna choke as you swallow the problem
Not gonna take this
Not gonna take this

I see the floor see the terror that gets you slow
This kinda does it, you bleed I fucking already broke
Its tragic times for the shadow believer
Not gonna take this
Not gonna take this

I swear your head is bigger than us all getting bigger
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat
Your more turned on than anyone could be
By yourself
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat

(Right before whispers in Backround) Thatâ€™s enough

(Whispers)
I gotta take this moment
Just to put you down
Spin you around with my foot on the back of you head
Up on the curb with the pressure on your teeth
Not gonna take this
Not gonna take this
I Watched the Rain Make A Puddle to get you soaked
The Swollen Words they Crack coming out your throat
A sticky time for the shadow believers
Not Gonna Take This
Not Gonna Take This


I swear your head is bigger than us all getting bigger
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat
Your more turned on than anyone could be
By your self
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat
Go slit your own throat
Slit your own throat

Not Gonna Take This
Not Gonna Take This
Not Gonna Take This
Not Gonna Take This
