I MISS YOU

to see you when i wake up is a gift 
i didn't think could be real
to know that you feel the same as i do 
is a three fold utopian dream
you do something to me that i can't explain
so would i be out of line if i said
i miss you

i see your picture
i smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine
you have only been gone 10 days 
but already im wasting away
i know ill see you again
weither far or soon
but i need you to know
that i care
and i miss you
