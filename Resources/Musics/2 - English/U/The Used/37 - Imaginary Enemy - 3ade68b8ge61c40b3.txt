IMAGINARY ENEMY

I wasn't made to understand
I've given up my name
Forgotten where I stand
Sometimes I don't know who I am
I used to feel so scared
I used to hold your hand

I'm so sick of playing favorites
Sick of being scared

They would rather see you all alone
Imaginary enemy
We are much less different than we know
Imaginary enemy
I would never leave you all alone
Imaginary enemy

I will not ever understand
Just how it got this way
And how it got so bad
You're not a part of what we need
There is no common ground
We hate what you believe

Who taught me to hate you
When I don't even know you
Who created the enemy
