INTO MY WEB

Whoaaa oh, oh.
Whoaaa oh, whoa.
Whoaaa, whoa, whoa oh, oh

Straight into my web.
Straight into my web.

I stopped to call you my little girl,
I meant more, so much more.
See me drop my jaw as you fly like a butterfly.

Maybe I will be the only one who could leave her.
Should I lie and just pretend that I couldn't kill
her?
Maybe I will be the only one who will leave her.
Should I lie and just pretend that I couldn't kill
her?
Maybe I can just pretend,
As she flies into my web.
I meant more. So much more.
That I'd like to push it half to death.
They want to, they watch you.

Silence turning heads and breaking necks.
Past time, we'll mean time.
See their jaws drop as you fly like a butterfly
straight into my web.
(Straight into my web)

Maybe I will be the only one who could leave her.

Do you feel stuck? It's all in your head
Mindless, I'm fading.
I miss the other flies, already dead
I caught some, and left one.
I saw them turning heads, and broke my neck
I learned to, they want to.
See me drop my jaw as you fly like a butterfly,
Straight into my web.

Maybe I will be the only one who could leave her.
Should I lie and just pretend that I couldn't kill
her?
Maybe I can just pretend,
As she flies into my web.
