CRY

You never know what it feels like
'Til you're there
When love changes, faces appear from nowhere

Where beautiful, lovely
Is ugly or alone
You need me back, bad
Just can't be on your own

Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

Now your life is broken
Revolves around love
Not love of yourself, but the love you have lost

We said desperation is lonely despair
You don't love yourself
You've got no love to share

Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

If you're gonna get me back
You're gonna have to ask nicer than that
If you're gonna get me back
You're gonna have to ask nicer than that

Nicer than that

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

Never say goodbye (nicer than that)
