THE NEXUS

I go fine without a reason or a purpose for
ever enough time, as the apathy's my self-control
Pricetag believe in
Could've been bold
I could be anything
Paid for the sermon on the mount
Book of faces, me?
Let will the Quartet, a chisel to sharpen the bone
Bow to the migraine
Never been told

Black crystal eyes pinned, you dared me
Play the mask for the debtors
Feed the fear in the dust
I'm the vine dried
The blue vain
The taste of your spit

Grace to the autopsy of inferiority
Could you Pardon me princess
May I just read my book?
It is dark in the light
And you hold it against me
I know that she watches me differently
Reading me
When the last page is through
The book belongs to her
And I'll pass on that migraine
Oh, Let it be known

Mouth of the canyon you dared me
Play the mask for the debtors
Feed the fear in the dust
I'm the vine dried
The blue vain
The taste of your spit

Nexus of the hearts, commit me
All my broken parts
That make me whole
I'll raise my voice
I know we're all the used, but not defeated
Nexus of the pain
Invites me (drags me back to)
(On my) feet again (off my knees)
My heartbeats full
I'll raise my voice
I know we are the used, but not defeated
We are the used
