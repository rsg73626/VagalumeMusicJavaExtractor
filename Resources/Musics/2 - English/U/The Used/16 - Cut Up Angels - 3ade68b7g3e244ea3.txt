CUT UP ANGELS

If we cut out the bad 
Well then we'd have nothing left
Like I cut up your mouth 
The night I stuffed it all in
And you lied to the angels
Said I stabbed you to death
If we go at the same time
They'll clean up the mess

I lost my head 
You couldn't come
This lust to my brain almost feels like a gun

Watch you bite into the bottle
Watch me kick out the chair
Let you chew up the glass
And laughed at you just hung there
I had thought of rose petals so perfectly pure
Then I thought of your petals 
And the abuse they've been through

I lost my head 
You couldn't come
This lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
You lost your head 
I couldn't come
This lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
Whoa whoa

I told the angels
Cant stay in heaven
I asked the devil
If we cut out the bad well then we'd have nothing left
Like I cut up your angels 
Yeah you stabbed me to death

I lost my head 
You couldn't come
This lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
You lost your head 
I couldn't come
This lust to my brain almost feels just like a gun
