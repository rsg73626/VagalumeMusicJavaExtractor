A SONG TO STIFLE IMPERIAL PROGRESSION (A WORK IN PROGRESS)

We're saying no way, no way USA
By declaring war on terror
you declare war on yourself
The war on drugs and poverty
Are only tools for gaining wealth
You occupy the peoples land
And think we don't know what it's for?
Drill a hole and fuck the ground
And spend the cash and print some more
We're sayin no way, no way USA

Try mixing blood and oil in the Middle East
Every president will "spread democracy"
They say democracy
They really mean DISEASE
Not satisfied till everyone is on their knees

So god bless the USA for what it's worth and let it be
Because there is no god
There is no USA, from what I see
So God bless the USA for what it's worth and let it go
It's just another lie we cannot buy
ran out of money long ago
