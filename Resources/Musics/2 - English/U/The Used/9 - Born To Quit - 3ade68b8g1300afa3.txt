BORN TO QUIT

Exercise the demon that is living up inside you,
after all you think you've been through,
just what have you been through.
Try to get beside yourself this tearing at your
insides,
if you end up on the wrong side,
always standing so strong.

Sharpen up your teeth,
your dreams are more than worth defending
in a fight that's never ending.
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong.

The further you go,
the less you know.
You're born to quit, you've blown it. 
(you've blown it)
You need to let go, of letting go,
you're full of shit, you're born to quit.

Something supernatural, it seems it could possess
you.
No malevolance about you, yeah,
that might not be true (might not be true)
How they kept you demanized the fucked up situation,
how you've killed off all the angels taking notice of you.

Sharpen up your teeth,
your dreams are more than worth defending
in a fight that's never ending.
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong.

The further you go,
the less you know.
You're born to quit, you've blown it. (you've blown
it)
You need to let go, of letting go,
you're full of shit, you're born to quit.

You've blown it,
you're born to quit.

Sharpen up your teeth,
your dreams are more than worth defending
in a fight that's never ending.
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong.

The further you go,
the less you know.
You're born to quit, you've blown it. (you've blown
it)
You need to let go, of letting go,
you're full of shit, you're born to quit.

You've blown it,
you're born to quit,
you've blown it.
(you've blown it, you've blown it)
