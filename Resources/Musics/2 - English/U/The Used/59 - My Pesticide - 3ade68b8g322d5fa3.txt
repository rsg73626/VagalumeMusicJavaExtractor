MY PESTICIDE

Stuck sitting in your own mess sinking
Call up arms to search for a better word
A mess you made, a smell you chose
I wont break in front of you

Better off on your own you said
I’ve seen that look in your eye
its embarrassing
one know cold And make this quite a pleasant poison and its

My life
My pesticide
Will tell the tide works overtime
Make it last a long one
Its my life
But leave this time
My pesticide
Slow to kill your dreams

Stay in bed and that’s another day wasted
Colors fade to grey like they never do
The whole things spins
And yes you chose
To think for only you
So pull the pin and let the whole thing go
Between that smile and look its embarrassing
Sell your soul and let this quite a pleasant poison and its

My life
My pesticide
Will tell the tide
Make it last a long one
Its my life
But leave this time
My pesticide
Slow to kill your dreams

Slow, slow, slow, slow to kill your dreams

My life
My pesticide
Will take the tide
Make it last a long one
Its my life
But me this time
My pesticide
Slow to kill your dreams

Slow, slow, slow, slow to kill your dreams
