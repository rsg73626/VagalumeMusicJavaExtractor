CHOKE ME

As of now I'm down straight up
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Or a box for a piece
Or a box for a smoke
But they're all gonna choke me

You're so crazy(x3)
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me

It's like a fucking drug deal 
I'm sitting here waiting 
I'm calling you back 
and you won't call me back 
and it's fucked up, but at the same time it just made me want you even worse. 

For awhile I was cleaner than now 
Then I started to destroy myself 
With things that I love now the things that I hate 
Until it finally broke me 

Fuck my ass! Now! Fuck my ass !
Choke me .
