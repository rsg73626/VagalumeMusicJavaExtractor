YESTERDAY'S FEELINGS

Yesterday's Feelings - The Used

Close my eyes and move to the back of my mind
The worries are washed out to sea
See the changes, people's faces blurred out
Like sunspots or raindrops

 ::Chorus::
Now all those feelings,
Those yesterday's feelings will all be lost in time
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind

Left the only worries I had in my hands
Away from the light in my eyes
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel
'Cause Feelings mean nothing

Now all those feelings,
Those yesterday's feelings will all be lost in time
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind
Yeah today is on my mind

I can't get a worry
I'm feeling so lonely
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
Close my eyes and move to the back of my mind
Where feelings mean nothing

Now all those feelings,
Those yesterday's feelings will all be lost in time
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind
for today is on my mind
Yeah today is on my mind

I can't get a worry
I'm feeling so lonely
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
