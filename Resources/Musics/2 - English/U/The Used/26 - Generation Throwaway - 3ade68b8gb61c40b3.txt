GENERATION THROWAWAY

Get watched as We dig in the dirt
While the pretty ones climb the trees
With the keys to the cage
Get caught as we're making it worse
As we break our backs we barely notice the pain
Yea we're taking it back

We're only moments away
Brave enough to break these barricades
It starts today
We're not generation throw away
Everything is fine, when I'm not afraid of glory
Moments away
We're not generation throwaway

Thrown back what we're trying to change
While the pretty ones climb the trees
we're not willing to pay
Play dead as we're digging a hole
They'll never realize till the day we've escaped
Yea we're taking it back
