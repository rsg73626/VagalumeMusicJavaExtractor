TUNNEL

I set out alone,
Crawl through the tunnel,
My eyes can hardly see the other side,
No longer cold,
Or feeling in trouble,
I realize that I am just alive....
So let it shine,

Cause we are, the light in the tunnel,
We are the living and dying,
See how we are, alone in the world,
We are the light in the tunnel,
That's all.....

Moving so slow, towards the end of the tunnel
I don't pretend I'll see the other side
I trudge through the mud
I push through the rubble
To realize that I am just alive
So let it shine

Cause we are, the light in the tunnel,
We are the living and dying,
See how we are, alone in the world
We are the light in the tunnel

The world is not leaving us (leave us behind)
But we will be leaving this world
Yeah, the world is not leaving us (leave us behind)
Do we believe in this world?

Cause we are, the light in the tunnel,
We are the living and dying,
See how we are, alone in the world
We are the light in the tunnel
That's all....
We are the light in the tunnel
That's all....
We are the light in the tunnel
That's all....
