MACHINE

Can't watch with mechanical eyes
I said ay-oh
You light a match, can't see in the dark
I said oh-no

Don't even laugh as you fight to survive
I said ay-oh
One at a time, save your life
Ay-oh-oh

Backfire
Shut your mouth you've got nothing to say
Backfire
You can break your back get fucked up, feel the heat

Can't stomp me out
I'm throwing daggers from my mouth
I don't get tired
You can't tie me up or slow me down
You can't stop me now

I am a machine

I step quick while you're falling behind
I said ay-oh
I watch you dig, bury yourself alive
I said oh-no

I brought a gun but my gun is a knife
I said ay-oh
One at a time, save your life
Ay-oh-oh

Backfire
Shut your mouth you've got nothing to say
Backfire
You can break your back get fucked up, feel the heat

Can't stomp me out
I'm throwing daggers from my mouth
I don't get tired
You can't tie me up or slow me down
You can't stop me now

I am a machine

I am a machine
I am a machine (louder and louder)
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine

You know I need so much more
More than I gave before
When metal replaces bone
The future is now, it's what you own
It's not enough to save yourself
You better think of something else

It's not exactly what I've become
But we know it's nothing that you have done
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Backfire
Shut your mouth you've got nothing to say
Backfire
You can break your back get fucked up, feel the heat

Can't stomp me out
I'm throwing daggers from my mouth
I don't get tired
You can't tie me up or slow me down
You can't stop me now

I am a machine

I am a machine
I am a machine (louder and louder)
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine
I am a machine
