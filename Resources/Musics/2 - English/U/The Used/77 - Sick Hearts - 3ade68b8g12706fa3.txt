SICK HEARTS

Call this a mask, call me strong
Call me a mess, call me wrong
cause sick hearts do fine
with wasting their time.

Pick up two words on the spot for the moment
Acting like it's what you meant to say
Calling to angels gets slow
tell me you dont believe they exist, anyway
I'd rather shut my eyes

Call this a mask, call me strong
Call me a mess, call me wrong
Cause sick hearts do fine
With wasting their time.

Lifting my head like the weight of the world
And it seems I forgot how to smile
Being friends with the devil gets dangerous and sad that
I don't really have many friends
(don't have a friend)
I'd rather shut my eyes

Call this a mask, call me strong
Call me a mess, call me wrong
Cause sick hearts deal fine
With wasting their times.

Call me a boy, tell I blur
(tell I blur)
Call me the bird or the worm
Cause sick hearts deal fine
With wasting their

There's so much left to see
But I'd rather shut my eyes
I dont know what's come over me
But I'd rather shut my eyes
There is so much that I could see
But I'd rather shut my eyes

Id rather shut my eyes
Id rather shut my eyes

Call this a mask, call me strong
Call me a mess, call me wrong
Cause sick hearts deal fine
With wasting their times.

Call me a boy, tell I blur
(tell I blur)
Call me the bird or the worm
Cause sick hearts deal fine
With wasting their time
With Wasting their time.
