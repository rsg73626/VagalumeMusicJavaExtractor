THE BEST OF ME

I could forget your name, 
I could forget your face forever
I could forget about the smile you always faked
The one you thought I thought would never

I could forget your lies, 
I could forget to hide for always
I could forget how desperately you tried, 
flattery will get you nowhere

I could forget how you had tried to get the best of me
You'll never forget that, 
you never got me!
YOU, NEVER, GOT, ME!

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you would dare
You make we wanna forget
You make me wanna forget

I could forget your pride, 
I could forget your wandering eyes
I could forget about the way you make me feel
You talk to me so condescending

I could forget how you had tried to get the best of me
You'll never forget that, 
you never got me!
YOU, NEVER, GOT, ME!

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you would dare
You make we wanna forget

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you would dare
You make we wanna forget

Never got me!

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you would dare
You make we wanna forget

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you would dare
You make we wanna forget

You make me!
You make me!
You make me wanna forget
You make me, FORGET!
