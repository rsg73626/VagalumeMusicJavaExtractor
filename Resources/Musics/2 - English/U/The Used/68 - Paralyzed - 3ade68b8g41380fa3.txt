PARALYZED

Before I could ever let you go, gonna beg until I drive you mad
And say something you could understand 
I'm a statue baby, knock me out

Oh how these moments fade away, you say you never loved me 
We say things we didn't mean to say 
I take it back, I take it all back now 
I take it back, I take it all back 

Paralyzed by the same old antics 
Back and forth like some walking spastic 
How could a fistfight be romantic? 
Thinking back now will you ever feel the same? 

You mean more to me than you'll ever know 
You're my girl and I think it's a shame 
That we get along this way 
I'm just a statue try to knock me out 

I guess these moments fade away, you say you never loved me 
We say things we didn't mean to say 
I take it back, I take it all back now 
I take it back, I take it all back 

Paralyzed by the same old antics 
Back and forth like some walking spastic 
How could a fistfight be romantic? 
Thinking back now will you ever feel the same? 

Paralyzed by the same old antics 
Back and forth like some walking spastic 
How could a fistfight be romantic? 
Thinking back now will you ever feel the same? 

Ya I know you feel the same, you gotta let me know
I'm dying inside you know 
Knock me out 
I'm dying inside you know
Let me know, knock me out 

Paralyzed by the same old antics 
Back and forth like some walking spastic 
How could a fistfight be romantic? 
Thinking back now will you ever feel the same? (3x)

You gotta let me know
I'm dying inside you know 
Knock me out 
I'm dying inside you know
Let me know, knock me out.
