EVOLUTION

Call me a traitor for changing my mind
Call me a criminal if thinking's a crime
Call me an animal, it's hard to define
Don't care what you say: I came to defy
I've come so far

Everything changes
With the way that I feel
Seems impossible I'll stay the same
Time rearranges
And the more we refuse is
The more time we stand in the way
And how am I to be myself
Everyone trying to be everyone else
Everything changes
With the way that I feel
Seems impossible I'll stay the same

Go back to the middle try filling the void
Watch thoughts into action? it's hard to destroy
Call me an animal and I won't deny
I don't care what you say. I came to defy

What will you do to me when I refuse to go
Who's going to fight all your wars
When the people won't show
What will you do to us
When we won't do what you say?
