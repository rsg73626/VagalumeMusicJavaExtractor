LITTLE GIRL

Dark form crawling in my room
A little girl is there
Shaking, starving all alone
Her eyes tell me she’s scared

Conversations with the dead
My soul lives on forgotten
See the girl, she’s staring back
Along the gates of hell

Fallen angel, hand of doom
Awake me from my dream
For I have slept now far too long
And visions I have seen

Alone

All you dream and all you know
Vanish into shadow
And may you speak to god of love
With angels flying high above
Life is hard
Twists and turns
In the end, you may burn
So cast your life into the well
And walk with me in hell

Calling out from Satan’s realm
I know I’m now forgotten
The little girl is standing there
Along the fields of rotten

Conversations with the dead
My soul lives on forgotten
See the girl who’s standing there
Along the gates of hell

Alone
