REIGN

Angry skies the devil cries,
And soon the sign of rain
Thunder cracks the lightning that echoes in my brain
And still the fire burns upon your twisted cross
Awaiting dark forever to alter all of time
And still the reign will fall

Floods that fill the river Styx
Now swell into the cold
Your time is my slavation for time it marches slow
So bring the book of lies, your pockets full of gold
And still my reign will fall from dark skies
I left to hold

So let the fires burn the dragons from your bed
And let it rain forever cold upon your head
Into this blackest sky and soon the rain will end
Trapped in this evil reign left crawling to your death

Hordes of flame a fiery beast has set upon this wrath
Cast to hell forever, now sending you to task
And still the fires burn upon your twisted lives
I've seen the lost forever you're running out of time

No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me

You don't need them
Never seen him
Won't believe them
Your soul is screaming
Their God is nothing - blood lies or something
Of Death ---- Adn then Death takes you!!!!

No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
No God can save you now
You're not asleep, so come with me
And still the reign will fall
