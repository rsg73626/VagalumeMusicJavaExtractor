WINTERKILL

Dark winter evening the glimmer of snow
A winter demon calling out fo my soul
Paint with insanity canvas all ways bare
Songs of the wolf carry on the winter air

Cold winter wind why do you trick my soul
Are you a devil in the night?
I hear the wolves calling out my name
They call of death on this night

It's cold as hell, I'm starting to freeze
Murders of raven keeping watching over me
Black eyes these birds of death
That hunger long for me
They wait to pick my bones
And set my spirit free

Cold winter wind why do you trick my soul
Are you a devil in the night?
I hear the wolves calling out my name
They call my death on this night

My soul now burns in hell
The birds of death I feed
The dogs of doom are cold
Their hunger long for me
Gray skies forever now
And crimson snows retreat
For I am but a dream
Upon a winter sleep

Cold winter wind why do you trick my soul
Are you a devil in the night?
I hear the wolves calling out my name
They call my death on this night
