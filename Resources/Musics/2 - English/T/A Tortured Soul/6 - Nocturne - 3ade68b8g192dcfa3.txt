NOCTURNE

When you live in darkness
You pray to the angel of light
And out of darkness
The silver is shining ever bright

So sing the song of a black time
Of sacrifice, ready to begin
Sing the song, so many lifetimes
Of sacrifice, blood in the wind

When you sleep in darkness
You dream of the fires in the night
And though it burns
The fire shall whisper in the night

Fire burn as the song it lasts forever
Join together as the angel starts to show
Behold the light with the angel in the fire
The angel laughs as he tears out your soul
Burn!

I am the nocturne
I am the black shadow in the night
In the end, you may burn
Through the shadows of the night
