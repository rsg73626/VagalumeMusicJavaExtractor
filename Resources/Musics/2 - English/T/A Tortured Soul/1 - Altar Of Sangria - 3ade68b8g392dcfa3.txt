ALTAR OF SANGRIA

Stare at your crucifix
You angel of tomorrow
Your future is your past
A door without a key

Look…Into the night; I see the eyes of my crimson demon
Blood…staining the stones, this is the place the altar of sangria

In bloody righteousness
You terrorize the mortals
The stain of Jesus Christ
For all the world to see

Look…Into the night; I see the eyes of my crimson demon
Blood…staining the stones, this is the place the altar of sangria
Fire…Burning tonight, I feel the flame pulling me forever
Stare…into the night, I drink the blood, join me forever

The pagan sacrifice
You resurrect immortals
The armies of the dead
The altar red with blood

Look…Into the night; I see the eyes of my crimson demon
Blood…staining the stones, this is the place, the altar of sangria

Fire…Burning tonight I feel the flame pulling me forever

There…Up on the stone, I drink the blood, join me forever
