ANOTHER LOVER

I've been waiting here for you all night
Once again no one to talk to alone
All my friends keep asking if I'm alright
'Cause they know you're never never at home
Baby, baby don't you know how hard I tried to hold on
But I can't keep holding on to what's gone
Guess it's time to tell I'm sorry to say
Girl I wish things didn't happen this way

Baby you left me alone
Never called me on the phone
So it happened naturally
Hope you're not too mad at me

Baby you wanted to take the time
So I had to find another lover
Girl I hope that I'm not blowing your mind
But I had to find another lover
All you ever did was leave me behind
So I had to find another lover
If you still wanna be friends, that's fine
But I had to find another lover

All you're saying you can't believe this is true
So you called me crazy, stupid, insane
Tell me baby what was I supposed to do
Sit around waiting for your ass in vain
You're the one who said you didn't see how
You could handle to look at me right now
Well I guess you thought to wish today
Never wanted things to happen this way

Baby you left me alone
Never called me on the phone
So it happened naturally
Don't you dare get mad at me

Baby you wanted to take the time
So I had to find another lover
Girl I hope that I'm not blowing your mind
But I had to find another lover
All you ever did was leave me behind
So I had to find another lover
If you still wanna be friends, that's fine
But I had to find another lover

Don't you know you left me all alone
Didn't even call my phone
Don't you know it happens eventually
Sorry baby but you know that you can't get mad at me

Baby you wanted to take the time
So I had to find another lover
Girl I hope that I'm not blowing your mind
But I had to find another lover
All you ever did was leave me behind
So I had to find another lover
If you still wanna be friends, that's fine
But I had to find another lover
