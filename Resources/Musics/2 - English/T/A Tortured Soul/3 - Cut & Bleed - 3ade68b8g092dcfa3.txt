CUT & BLEED

Fool laughs blood flows from his face
He stares out in the world
No longer in control of his life gone he’s lost the race
Standing all alone he never sees tomorrow’s light
Blood tracks in the snow and now there’s nowhere left to hide

No shelter in the night
Innocence and fear
No shelter in the night
Fire burning clear

Cut and bleed decapitate the heads will roll
Death is here
Cut and bleed decapitate the heads will roll
With a stare

No safe place to hide blood is in the air
No shelter in the night
Fire burning clear

Cut and bleed
