NE VER', NE BOYSYA (ENGLISH)

Different nights
Different people
Wants, doesn't want
Loves, doesn't love
Someone will fall behind
Someone will jump off the mark
Someone will tire
And stop wanting

Someone will wind wire
Onto terminals
Someone will confuse
New themes
Someone's a psycho
Someone's a maniac
Someone's like you
Someone's like me

[Chorus]
Don't light up and don't extinguish
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask
And calm down...and calm down
Don't believe, don't fear, don't ask (x2)
Don't believe, don'e fear (x3)
And don't ask

Somewhere there's a lot of us
Somewhere not enough
But on the roads
There'll be a raid
Someone will take a risk
And someone will fail
Someone will understand
But he won't help

Someone will leave
Someone will return
Someone will find
A new sun
Someone into the bushes
And someone like me
Someone like you
Someone like me
