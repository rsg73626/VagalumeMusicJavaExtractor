ALL ABOUT US

They say,
Don't trust,
You, me,
We, us,
So we'll fall,
We must,
Just you, me,
And it's all about,
It's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'cause you know (us)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'cause you know (us)

It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us

If they hurt you,
They hurt me too,
So we'll rise up,
Won't stop,
And it's all about,
It's all about, 

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (us)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'Cause you know (us)

It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us

They don't know,
They can't see,
Who we are,
Fear is the enemy,
Hold on tight,
Hold on to me,
'Cause tonight, 

It's all about us,
It's all about, all about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (us)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (us)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'Cause you know (us)

It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you I can trust  (It's all about us)

It's all about us!
It's all about us
