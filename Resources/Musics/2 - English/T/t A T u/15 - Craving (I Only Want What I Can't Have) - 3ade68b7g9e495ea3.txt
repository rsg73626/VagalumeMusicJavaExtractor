CRAVING (I ONLY WANT WHAT I CAN'T HAVE)

When I left you, I flew
Did you fly too?
And nakedness befell my way
Only seen in light of day

I only want what I can’t have
I only need what I don’t want
I only want what I can’t have
I only need what I don’t want

And creativity, it haunts my soul
I asked not to be alone
You don’t have to ask me for my hand
I already know where I stand

I only want what I can’t have
I only need what I don’t want
I only want what I can’t have
I only need what I don’t want

And consequences in the future
And feel it as now
And now I can’t feel the future
But I can be there for you now

I only want what I can’t have
I only need what I don’t want
I only want what I can’t have
I only need what I don’t want
