SNOWFALLS

Stayin' up through the night
Black or white, no big deal
Going home after dark
Rolling sleeves for the kill

Everything goes away
Dying and coming back
Falling into the fray
Forcing you off the track

Speeding and pulling back
Down & then up we go
Into the falling snow

Stay closer, be brighter
Than lightning, be
Be frightening, be lighter
Than lightning, be

Stay closer, be brighter
Than lightning, be
Be frightening, be lighter
Than lightning, be

Shooting stars dreaming of
Endless years, as they fall
Crawling back, feeling down
Is the worst way to go

Crashing into the ground
Too many lives to spend
Driving into the light
Wonderful lies to end

Crashing into the ground
Down & then up we go
Into the falling snow

Stay closer, be brighter
Than lightning, be
Be frightening, be lighter
Than lightning, be

Stay closer, be brighter
Than lightning, be
Be frightening, be lighter
Than lightning, be
