FLY ON THE WALL

When you're naked in the shower
When you're sleeping for an hour
When you're big, when you're small
Oh, I wish I was a fly on the wall

When you're with her after midnight
When you kiss her in the dim light
When you break Barbie Doll
Oh, I wish I was a fly on the wall

Wanna see who you are
Every inch, every scar

[Pre Chorus]
From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air

[Chorus]
When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah

For the drama that you're drinking
And the dark thought you are thinking
And the love notes that you scrawl
Oh, I wish I was a fly on the wall

Silently I arrive
You don't know I'm alive

[Pre Chorus]
From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air

[Chorus]
When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah

Wish I was a fly on the wall. yeah, yeah

Ever closer, ever nearer
When you're looking in the mirror
I would know who you call
If I was a fly on the wall

[Pre Chorus]
From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air

[Chorus]
When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah

Wish I was a fly on the wall. yeah, yeah

From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air
What you do on your own
I could see all
When you think you're alone
I would crawl

[Chorus]
When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah
