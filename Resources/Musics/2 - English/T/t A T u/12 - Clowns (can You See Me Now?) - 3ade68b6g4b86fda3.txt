CLOWNS (CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?)

Can you see me now? Can you see me now? Can you see?

All this weeping in the air,
Who can tell where it will fall through floating forests in the air
'Cross the rolling open sea.
Blow a kiss I run through air. Leave the past find nowhere,
Floating forests in the air, clowns all around you.

Clowns that only let you know where you let your senses go.
Clowns all around you its a cross I need to bear.
All this black and cruel dispair, this is an emergency
Don’t you hide your eyes from me, open them and see me now.

Can you see me now? Can you see? Can you see me now?
Can you see? Can you see? Can you see?
Can you see? Can you see me now? Can you see?
Can you see? Can you see me now?
Can you see me now? Can you see clowns all around you.
Can you see? Can you see?
Can you see? Can you see me now?
Floating, floating, floating, floating.

See me here in the air not holding on to anywhere
But holding on so beware I have secrets I won't share.
See me here wishing you 
If I then deny I do contemplate our wish away.
If I ask you not to stay. 

Clowns that only let you know where you let your senses go.
Clowns all around you its a cross I need to bear.
All this black and cruel dispair, this is an emergency
Don’t you hide your eyes from me, open them and see me now.

Can you see me now? Can you see me now? Can you see? Can you see? Can you see?
