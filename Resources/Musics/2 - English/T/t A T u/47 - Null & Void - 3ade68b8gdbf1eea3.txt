NULL & VOID

Tell me with Affection in your voice
That you never really had a choice
Place on me the burden of the past
Offer me the future and take it back

Show me what you never meant to show
Tell me what I'm not supposed to know
Contradict me when you're in the wrong
Don't commit to anything at all

My life is null and void
Dismantled and destroyed
My life is null and void
My life is null and void

Fill me with compassion and concern
Thrill me with an unexpected turn
Tempt me with the secrets that you hold
Don't divulge until you're in control

Show me what you never meant to show
Tell me what I'm not supposed to know
Contradict me when you're in the wrong
Don't commit to anything at all

My life is null and void
Dismantled and destroyed
My life is null and void
My life is null and void

My life is null and void
Dismantled and destroyed
My life is null and void
My life is null and void

My life is null and void
Dismantled and destroyed
My life is null and void
My life is null and void
