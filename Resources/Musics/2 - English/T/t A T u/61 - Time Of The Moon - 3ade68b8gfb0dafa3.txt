TIME OF THE MOON

We're killing space and wasting time 
And dying hard and spilling beans
We're moving fast on intuition 
In the world of stupid things
We are the flyers 
No return and no regrets and no delay
Into the frenzy this is crazy 
Burning wheels to get away

(Chorus)
Time of the moon
In the sky cloud is breaking
Voice of the doom
For the birds in the making

The time is wasted
On intuition
We are the flyers
Into the frenzy
We're spilling bids
On stupid things
With no delay
We get away

(Chorus)
Time of the moon
In the sky cloud is breaking
Voice of the doom
For the birds in the making

No destination is the way 
We're talking of accelerate
Get rid of garbage
Yes, you may 
They draw the bridge but it's too late
We are the final revelation 
Shooting through the burning sky
Abandoned cargo hits the ground on broken wings
We are flying high
