ALL MY LOVE

Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
I'm yours

Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
I'm yours

I regret what i said,
I was scared and upset and i've made a mistake
I accept all the blame and I lied
Sorry, forgive me, please
And I know,  i betrayed, every fault thet i made
And the pain that i caused, all the promisses lost
Yes, i lied, sorry, forgive me
Won't you please just love me, and hold me
And tell me, you forgive me, love me, and hold me
I'm sorry, won't please forgive me

Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
I'm yours

Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
Love me for who i am
I'm yours

I regret what i said,
I was scared and upset and i've made a mistake
I accept all the blame and i lied
Sorry, forgive me, Please
And i know, I betrayed, every fault that i made
And the pain that i caused, all the promises lost
Yes i lied, sorry, forgive me
Won't please just love me, and hold me, and tell me
You forgive me, love me, and hold me
I'm sorry, won't please forgive me...
