SPARKS

Delicate endless flow
Running down my eletric wire
Sunshine and midnight glow
Lightning discharge and eternal fire

Sparks are flying in my head
Fading softly playing dead
Sparks are flying in my head
Sparks are flying in her head

Headlights are glowing dim
Silly words looking for a meaning
Thinking of who will win
Fire is stopped and nobody's winning

Sunset is burning out
Getting no sleep till the happy hour
What if we lived without
Something we always knew was ours

Sparks are flying in my head
Fading softly playing dead
Sparks are flying in my head
Sparks are flying in her head

Sparks are flying in my head
Fading softly playing dead
Sparks are flying in my head
Sparks are flying in her head

Sparks are flying...
