A SIMPLE MOTION

The simplest stroke is the swell of the ocean
The slightest caress, a well of emotion
Flowing through you and flowing through me
Waiting in silence, swirling inside you
Steady and slow, rhythm is patience
All that we know, answers to questions
Growing in you, growing in me
fulfilling a need, over and over...

A simple motion
A simple motion
A simple motion
A simple motion
Over and over
A simple motion
Over and over
A simple motion
Over and over
A simple motion
Over and over
A simple motion

The smallest of glances a deep understanding
A brush of a hand, love everlasting
Covering you, covering me
Eternally made, over and over
The quietest whispers drown out explosions
voices are heard but words never spoken
Coming from you and coming from me
Filling a void, over and over...

A simple motion
Over and over...
