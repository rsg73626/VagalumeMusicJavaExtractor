NOT GONNA GET US

Not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

They're not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

Starting from here, lets make a promise
you and me, let's just be honest
We are gonna run, nothing can stop us
Even the night, that falls all around us

Soon there will be laughter and voices
Beyond the clouds over the mountains
We'll run away on roads that are empty
Lights from the airfield shining upon you

Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us

They're not gonna get us (x5)

We'll run away, to everything simple
Night will come down our guardian angel
We rush ahead the crossroads are empty
Our spirits rise they are not gonna get us

My love for you always forever
Just you and me all else is nothing
Not going back - not going back there
they don't understand
they don't understand us

Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

They're not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

Not gonna get us
(repeat until fade)
