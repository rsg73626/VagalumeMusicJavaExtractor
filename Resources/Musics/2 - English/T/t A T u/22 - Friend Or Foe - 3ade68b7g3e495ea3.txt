FRIEND OR FOE

Is it too late?
Nothing to salvage
You look away
Clear all the damage

The meaning to 
All words of love
Has disappeared

We used to love one another
Give to each other
Lie under covers, so,
Are you friend or foe?

(Love) One another
Live for each other, so,
Are you friend or foe?
'Cause I used to know

The promises
Hollow concessions
And innocent 
Show of affection
I touch your hand
A hologram
Are you still there?

We used to love one another
Give to each other
Lie under covers, so,
Are you friend or foe?

(Love) One another
Live for each other, so,
Are you friend or foe?
'Cause I used to know

We used to
We used to
We used to
Used to
Used to

Is it too late?
Nothing to salvage
You look away
Clear all the damage

The meaning to
All words of love
Has disappeared

We used to love one another
Give to each other
Lie under covers, so,
Are you friend or foe?
