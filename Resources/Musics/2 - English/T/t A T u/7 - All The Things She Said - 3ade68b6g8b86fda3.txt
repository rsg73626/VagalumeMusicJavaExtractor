ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID

All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
This is not enough

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?

I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out
want to fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else so we can be free
Nobody else, so we can be free

All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
This is not enough
this is not enough

All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Want to fly her away with the sun and the rain
Coming over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
This is not enough
This is not enough

All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said

Mother, looking at me
Tell me what do you see?
Yes, I've lost my mind

Daddy, looking at me
Will I ever be free?
Have I crossed the line?

All the things she said
All the things she said
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head
Runing through my head
All the things she said
This is not enough
This is not enough

All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
Things she said
