LITTLE PEOPLE

Night – little shadows run
Night – we can be as one
Time for some kiss and tell
Time we can live as well

We will abandon shame
This is another game
This tricky hide and seek
Is always fucking freak

Little people break like china,
Little people fall to pieces,
Ugly, pretty, major, minor,
Shoot to kill, nobody misses

Little people melt like vinyl,
Little people reassemble,
Bigger, smaller, better, finer,
Little pieces on the table

Love is an exercise
In always telling lies,
In always breaking hearts,
In changing body parts

And when we run like hell,
No one will break the spell,
We will be on our way
We will be anyway
