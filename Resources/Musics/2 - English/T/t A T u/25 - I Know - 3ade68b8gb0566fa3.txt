I KNOW

I know I know
I know where to go

I know I know
I know where to go

I have forgotten what it's like to walk alone
Running around at night to find another zone
Imagination is the key that carries me
No destination for me
No destination for me

Predictability has allways been the same
I wanna break it down
I wanna break the chain
Sometimes it feels like I am caught up in the mix
Looking for a different place
That I can get my kicks

Please stop making me stop
I won't do what you tell me
Can't be something I'm not
Can't be where I don't wanna be

You can't hold me back
You break me
Please stop making me stop
Can't be where I don't wanna be

I know I know
I know where to go

I always wonder how to get from here to there
It's getting closer million miles from anywhere
Communication is reserved for yesterday
I'm gettin ready to pay,
I'm gonna have it my way

My motivation is to get the hell away
As soon as seasons has prepared me for today
Something is changing and my vision is coming clear
I'm not a child anymore
I run away from here

Please stop making me stop
I won't do what you tell me
Can't be something I'm not
Can't be where I don't wanna be

You can't hold me back
You break me
Please stop making me stop
Can't be where I don't wanna be

I know where to go (8x)
