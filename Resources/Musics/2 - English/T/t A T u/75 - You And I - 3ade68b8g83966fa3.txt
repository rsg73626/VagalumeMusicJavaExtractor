YOU AND I

Every night
We're all alone
Every night
My only hope
Is the light that's shining from inside you
'cause you believe in what we are
You believe in what we'll be
Give me strength so I can stand beside you 

No truths to confirm
No lies to deny
Too hopeless to care
We're too scared to cry

You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Gotta fight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
Sanctified
You and I
Feels so right
You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
For the rest of our lives

Cast aside
To an angry street
Criticized
For what we believe
If we hide maybe we can make it through this
Is it fair to be thrown away?
Is it fair that we live this way?
Victimized for a life we didn't ask for... 

No truths to confirm
No lies to deny
Too hopeless to care
We're too scared to cry 

You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Gotta fight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
Sanctified
You and I
Feels so right
You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
For the rest of our lives
