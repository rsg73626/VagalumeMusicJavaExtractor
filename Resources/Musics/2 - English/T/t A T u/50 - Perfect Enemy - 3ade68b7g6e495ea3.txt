PERFECT ENEMY

Why should I welcome
Your domination
Why should I listen
To explanations

I'm not pretending
To make it simple
Try to be something
Experimental

You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before,
Are now for sale

Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I'll forever stay
Your perfect enemy

No longer waiting
Remove illusions
No more complaining
Forget confusion

No more compassion
Not sentimental
I am now something
Experimental

You don't turn me off
I will never fail
Things I loved before,
Are now for sale

Keep yourself away
Far away from me
I forever stay
Your perfect enemy
