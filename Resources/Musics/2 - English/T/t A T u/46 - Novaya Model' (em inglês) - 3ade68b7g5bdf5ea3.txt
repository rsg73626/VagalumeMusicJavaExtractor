NOVAYA MODEL' (EM INGLÊS)

Unheard words
Autopilots
Recording had started
Applause

So this is how it turned out
It's not important who you are
These are such
Experiments

Refrão
Everything that had begun ends
Honest love doesn't happen
The blowing wind and the blanketing snowstorm
But I will remain - I'm a new model

Rotations
All these transactions
All of this is shallow 
It's not important who you are

Autopilots
A wheel with squirrels***
A wheel with squirrels***
Autopilots

refrão
Everything that had begun ends
Honest love doesn't happen
The blowing wind and the blanketing snowstorm
But I will remain - I'm a new model
