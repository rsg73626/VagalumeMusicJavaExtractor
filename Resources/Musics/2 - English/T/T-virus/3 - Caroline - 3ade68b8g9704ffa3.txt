CAROLINE

Caroline is only sixteen
So pure innocent and clean
She's all dressed up to go to prom
But her date wanted it all
Oh caroline your so sweet
Don't you know you belong to me

Oh caroline she didn't know
She would die die die
Oh caroline
Tonight is the last night of your life

Oh caroline don't cry
It will only hurt for a while
He knew caroline would tell
A few weeks later she was found dead
