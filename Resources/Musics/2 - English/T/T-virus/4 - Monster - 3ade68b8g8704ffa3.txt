MONSTER

I was told I died in my sleep

I know something vicious struck me
Insanity like a bad dream

I'm back from hell to live again
Cause you've been treating me

And you've been feeding me
You've created a monster

Back from the dead
To live again
You've created a monster
Monster

Genetic experimental beast
Well I'm a mutating spreading disease
Insanity like a bad dream
I'm back from hell to live again
