CAN I CUT MY WRISTS FOR YA?

Can I cut my wrists for ya?
Cuz the fire it?s burning but do not hurt me
[ROBOT/WHISPER]

Try to fit my eyes 
Try to believe in my lies
The time it?s coming
And will end for you

Runaway while it is time
My time has ended 
But I don?t care anymore
My mouth is dry
And I can?t fly

You say: home 
I say alone
Sometimes the worst thing that we can do
Becomes the precious pride
Nothing to the rhyme
This is the end of the time
And to you only remain

Runaway while it is time
My time has ended 
But I don?t care anymore
My mouth is dry
And I can?t fly

Hide the shame...... become the pain 3x

Hit the floor                                    
Open my head for you                    
And you're done, killed me               

Killed me                                   
Hit the floor                                    
Open my head for you                    
And you're done, killed me               

Killed me !               
Killed me!
