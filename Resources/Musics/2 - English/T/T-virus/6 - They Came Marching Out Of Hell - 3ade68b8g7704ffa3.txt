THEY CAME MARCHING OUT OF HELL

I can't believe the things,
The things that I've just seen
I can't believe it is
I can't believe it's real

I hear the wolfs I hear them
Howling at the moon
The nightmare is coming
It's coming to us soon

We're waking up the dead
They came marching out of hell

I've seen the dead
I've seen them rising from
Their graves
I've seen the living dead
And from hell they came
