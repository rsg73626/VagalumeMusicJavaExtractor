BETELGEUSE

It’s the sight of the century. i swear i saw you in it.
Two worlds collide as one star abides by one universal law
That says everything must die, though very few so beautiful.
But no matter what i see i’ll mourn the constellation;
One piece short in a story board of sorts.
Adjust the pages cause’ there’s blood in the water.

But we demonstrate!
Everyday life we don’t even see them.
Certainly death is where we will keep them.
Looking past the nose but only no further as we’re
Searching for the truth but don’t want an answer.
It’s a waste.

It’s the fight of the century. i swear i saw you in it.
A fist swings true and bullets cut right through
A mocking bird to kill the song.
But save your excuses for the strawman.
And like an execution crowd gathered around
To walk on the shroud, only to find taking it back is not allowed.
It’s reminiscent of one so innocent.

But we demonstrate!
Everyday life we don’t even see them.
Certainly death is where we will keep them.
Looking past the nose but only no further as we’re
Searching for the truth but don’t want an answer.
It’s a waste.


And with all the things that will burn in our circle
I never knew your mind.
But you were the brightest in my eye.

But we demonstrate!
Certainly death is where we will keep them.
Certainly death is where we will keep them.
Certainly death is where we will keep them.
Certainly!
