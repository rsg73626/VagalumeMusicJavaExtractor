DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SUMMER

We use to find ourselves in familiar places 
Beautiful faces tell us stories. 
To last, to last throughout the winter 
And memories for longer. 

So I will put away these childish things 
And pretend like they never fit. 
And nothing beats the view like the view from the floor 
It doesn’t feel like summer anymore. 

You’re makin’ waves now off the east coast and that 
Makes more sense now. It makes more sense now 
Cause’ who needs anyone to hold there hand 
While they’re running away as fast as they can. 

So I will put away these childish things 
And pretend like they never fit. 
And nothing beats the view like the view from the floor 
It doesn’t feel like summer anymore. 

So I will put away these childish things 
And pretend like they never fit. 
And nothing beats the view like the view from the floor 
It doesn’t feel like summer anymore.
