INDUSTRIAL VILLAGE LOVER

There's a place in this town
A different place from the others
The houses are grey
And neighbourhod speaks loud
There's a place where I loved her

Six in the morning, I come back to home
Industrial village afternoon
Taking the first train
While the birds starts to sing

Industrial village lover
Industrial village turn me on
Industrial village lover
Industrial village turn me on

Doo doo, doo doo, yeah

Industrial village turns me on
My industrial village turns me on
Industrial village lover
Industrial village lover
