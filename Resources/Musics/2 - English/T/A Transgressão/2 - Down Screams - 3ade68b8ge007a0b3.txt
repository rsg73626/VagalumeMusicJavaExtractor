DOWN SCREAMS

I walk in the dirty every day
And I feel like I piece of disgrace
A broken-hearted man put the gun in your head
How many clicks to understand?

I don't need your hot boys
I don't care about any drug
Now nothing is good enough for me
Oh yeah yeah yeah

I seek a new behaviour
I would be part of fight (in this life)
I think is the destiny going down on my head

Down, down, down, down

Come a solution, please coming up
And my distance of it all
Put it inside the ground
Down, down, down, down

I don't need your hot boys
I don't care about any drug
Now nothing is good enough for me
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Â-hã
