HEY YOU

Hey you will see as it makes
Hey you I don't like your fucking fake
Hey you you're an cursed person
I'm seeing the holy shit that you are doing

Go ahead, take advantage

Try sell your soul
Get money in pain
Go ahead
Go ahead
Take advantage

Hey you take a look the news on tv
Hey you see the fire
And the fallen corpse on the street
Hey you did allready pray today?
Hey you, do you feel accomplished?

Go ahead, take advantage

Were's inocence, shyness
This is a crime?
Hey you
Will see as it makes
I don't like so much your fucking fake
You're an cursed person
I'm seeing all shit that you're doing
