BURNIN' LOVE

Lord almighty, I feel my temperature rising
Higher and higher
I'm burning right through to my soul
Boy, boy, boy, you're gonna and set me on fire
My brain is flaming but I don't know which way to go

You see your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet songs of a choir
And you light my morning sky with burning love

Ooh ooh ooh, I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
I'm burning, burning, burning and nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke but I feel fine

You see your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet songs of a choir
And you light my morning sky with burning love

It's coming closer, the flames are reaching my body
Please won't you help me
It feels like I'm drifting away
It's hard to breathe, and my chest is a'heaving
You're singing Lord have mercy
I'm burning a hole where I lay

You see your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet songs of a choir
And you light my morning sky with burning love

With burning love, burning love
With burning love, burning love
With burning love, burning love

I said a hunk, a hunk of burning love
I said a hunk, a hunk of burning love
I said a hunk, a hunk of burning love
