TRASH LIKE YOU

Baby, I don't know why I love you the best
It might be that Elvis tattoo on your chest
Your black hair shining against your eyes so blue
Baby, your gloves make you look so cool
Sipping on liquor from my high heel shoes
You know my mama would kill me if she caught me out with trash like you

Trash like you
A hunk, you're my kind of man
You know to work with your hands
You're my colorful cutie
My state fair-loving machine
And it is hard to think bad about you
When you're loving me the way you do
You know my mama would kill me if she caught me out with trash like you

You know my mama would kill me if she caught me out with trash like you

I smell leather and gasoline
Hanging on the back of your screaming machine
We go a hundred and twenty
Just cutting the wind between
You can ride me to the country with you
And make all my wishes come true
You know my mama would kill me if she caught me out with trash like you

Trash like you
A hunk, you're my kind of man
You know to work with your hands
You're my colorful cutie
My state fair-loving machine
And it is hard to think bad about you
When you're loving me the way you do
You know my mama would kill me if she caught me out with trash like you

You know my mama would kill me if she caught me out with trash like you
