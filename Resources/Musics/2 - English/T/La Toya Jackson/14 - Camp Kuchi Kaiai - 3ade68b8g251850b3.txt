CAMP KUCHI KAIAI

I came along one rainy day and you were there
Ignoring you, my spirits down but I don't care
With open arms you welcomed me but I did not see
You tried to make me see the love you had for me

I didn't want to make you know
Fearing so because of me
You're gonna let me know
Feeling so Camp Kuchi Kaiai, Kaiai
Camp Kuchi Kaiai
Take me to the sky
Love has got me high

Time to share
Feeling for you and how it grows so strong
You told me things I did not dot or even know
We played, we laughed, we loved
We shared secrets of our lives

And didn't know why oh why
Feeling high, feeling for you
I wanna know why oh why
Camp Kuchi Kaiai

It's lovely love between us
Sharing what we have as one
Lovers sometimes do get weary
But our love shines bright as the sun

I wannaknow why oh why
I'm feeling high
Camp Kuchi Kaiai
I wanna know why oh why
I'm feeling high
Camp Kuchi Kaiai
