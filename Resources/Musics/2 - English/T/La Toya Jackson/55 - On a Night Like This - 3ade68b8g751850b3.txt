ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS

I'm thinkin' I've had enough
Of this livin' in the city
I'm thinkin' this world's too tough
I wanna feel soft and pretty
I've got to get away
Where people like to play
They bang their drums
And sing their songs
And dance until tomorrow
(Chorus)
On a night like this
I feel it in the air
There's magic everywhere
On a night like this
We just might fall in love
Oh, anything can happen
And maybe the city street
Will sail off to the Caribbean
And people just won't believe
All the beauty they'll be seeing
We won't have time to fight
We'll only fill the night
With love for life
And black and white
Will glow with many colors
Anything can happen
Tropical breezes always make me feel
Like I've got the world on a string
If you hold me closely I know you will hear
The sound of everybody singing
On a night like this
Anything can happen
On a night like this
On a night like this
Come on, come on
Anything can happen
On a night like this
Anything can happen
On a night like this
We just might fall in love
On a night like this
Anything can happen
On a night like this
On a night like this
