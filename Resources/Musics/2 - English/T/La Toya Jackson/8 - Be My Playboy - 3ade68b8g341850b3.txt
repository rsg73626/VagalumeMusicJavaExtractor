BE MY PLAYBOY

I don't care if you're rich or poor
Oh baby I don't care if you live next door
And I don't care about your college grades
Oh baby I don't care how much bread you've made

And I don't care who came before me
Just really know I'm in love
Gotta have a love that's strong
Loving you is important to me
So don't go wasting time
Just say you're mine

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you

I need a lot of warm affection
Just to keep me satisfied
Can't help feel this strong attraction
Hit me with your love reaction

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too

I don't care care for outrageous things
Oh baby, I don't need furs and diamond rings
I only need love that's serious
So baby come right here
I've got plans for us

And all the girls have got your number
I love you so just say no
I need your love tonight
Don't just satisfy that hunger
And I mean it when I say keep far away

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you

I need a lot of warm affection
Just to keep me satisfied
Can't help feel this strong attraction
Hit me with your love reaction

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too

I want a playboy. Do you wanna?
Do, do you wanna make me very happy?

I don't need your limousines
See I feel at home in my baggy jeans
And I don't need the things you buy
Baby all I want is an honest guy
And I don't need no fancy yacht
I don't care how much you got
All I want is a boy like you - maybe two!

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you
