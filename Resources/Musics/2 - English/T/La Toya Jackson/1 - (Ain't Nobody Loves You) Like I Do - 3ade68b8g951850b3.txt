(AIN'T NOBODY LOVES YOU) LIKE I DO

There ain't nobody loves you like I do

You think that I've been cheating
I can see it in your eyes

They say that I've been running round
Do you believe in lies?
Ooh
Ooh
Loving you
That's all I wanna do

Do I have to prove myself to you? - Yeah

I wouldn't hurt you
Baby
Don't believe a word they say

After all that we've been through how could I
Anyway?
So you think that I could really be so cruel

There ain't no mountain high I wouldn't climb for you 'cause

There ain't nobody loves you like I do

Don't let their jealous talk get through to you
'Cause if they start a rumour that my heart ain't true

Don't let it come between us 'cause there ain't nobody loves you like I do

You got so many questions
I can see it in your face

They say that my affections are somehow out of place
Ooh
Ooh
Loving you
That's all I wanna do

There's no river deep I wouldn't swim for you 'cause
There ain't nobody loves you like I do


Aii this time you were playing on my mind

Didn't think you were the kind to throw it all away
What was I to do
I should've seen right through
Aii the bad
Bad lies tearing me apart inside!

Ooh
Ooh
Loving you is all I wanna do

Ooh
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for you 'cause
There ain't nobody loves you like I do

There ain't nobody loves you like I do

There ain't nobody loves you like I do
