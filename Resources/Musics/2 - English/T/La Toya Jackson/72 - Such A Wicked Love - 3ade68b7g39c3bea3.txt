SUCH A WICKED LOVE

Wicked love
Break it in.

All my life
I've always wanted more
Now that I fell for you
I've got what you're lookin' for
So satisfied
That I stopped searchin'
Whatever you do to me
Baby, it's workin'

Your love is trouble
That made my feelings double
I enjoy to flirt with danger
Hate to brush with trouble, baby
Because for LaToya
You throw me, I'll destroy you
Just to keep your love excited
I'll always enjoy you

Such a wicked love
The love you treated
Exactly what I needed
Such a wicked love, baby
The love you treated
(You're exactly what I needed)

Don't waste my time, no no no
Oh oh baby

Your reputation
Got women scared of you
They say that you love 'em and leave 'em
But I'm still under you
So don't you cheat on me
'Cause if you slip
I won't say a word to you
Don't give me no lip, baby

The way you hold me
I feel so lucky
My body tingles, sings jingles
Every time you touch me
I can't describe it
This love is something
And if I can't have your lovin'
I don't want nothing

(Repeat)

I need a wicked love
Ooh, yes indeed
You're exactly what I need
A wicked love, baby
The love you treated
(You're exactly what I needed)

Shh!
I think I hear Mr. Bass knockin'
Cool, we're gonna make the rules
This ain't no joke
Knock on the door, go for broke

I got a thing for you

Such a wicked lover
I got a thing for you
Such a wicked lover
I got a thing for you
Such a wicked lover
I got a thing for you
Yes I do
Such a wicked lover
I got a
Scratch my back

(Wicked Love)
I need a wicked kind of lover
(Wicked love)
And that's a fact
He's got to be exact
(Exactly what I needed)
Don't you go nowhere, oh baby

Such a wicked love
Such a wicked love
Such a wicked love
Such a wicked love, baby
Such a wicked love
Such a wicked love
Such a wicked love, wicked love

Such a wicked love
(Wicked love)
Such a wicked love, baby
(Wicked love)
(You're exactly what I needed)

(Repeat)

All right, y'all. I'm out of here.
Peace.
