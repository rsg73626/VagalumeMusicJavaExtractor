TIMES ARE CHANGING

Times are changing
Times are changing, yeah

Whenever you feel threatened
By what you see around you
Keep this thought in mind
People are changing
Love is in fashion
Aggression is fading away
The young have learned from mistakes of the past
And music's showing us the way
What we have is a plan for today and tomorrow
Hear what I'm saying, baby

Times are changing
Things are getting better, baby
Times are changing, yeah
Oh yeah
Times are changing

It may not be dramatic
It's not a revolution
But it's a fact of life
People are changing
Love is the answer
To build a better day
There is no happy ending like a Tv show
The struggle takes some time to see
But if we all stand together it will be worthwhile
You better believe me, baby

Times are changing
Things are getting better, baby

People getting closer together
