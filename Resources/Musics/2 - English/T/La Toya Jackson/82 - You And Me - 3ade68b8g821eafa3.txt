YOU AND ME

I, I didn't know what real love was
Until I fell in love with you
Now I know that it's real
Don't ever leave me

With you
I feel the days will never end
Like the river flows, and then
And then you fill my soul
Don't ever leave me

You and me, you and me
Let's love each other always
Hold me closer
Love me, love me
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
You and me, you and me
Let's love each other always
Hold me closer
Love me, love me
Let's make it last forever
Don't you know our love will never die

I, I didn't know what real love was
Until I fell in love with you
Now I know that it's love
Don't ever leave me

You and me, you and me
Let's love each other always
Hold me closer
Love me, love me
Let's make it last forever
You know our love will never die
Oh no, uh, yeah, yeah

Oh, you and me, you and me
Let's love each other always
Hold me closer
Love me, love me
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever

You and me, you and me
Let's love each other always
Hold me closer
Love me, love me
Let's make it last forever
You know our love will never, ever die
(Oh yeah, I like this)
Hold me closer
Love me, love me
Let's make it last forever
You know our love will never, ever die
