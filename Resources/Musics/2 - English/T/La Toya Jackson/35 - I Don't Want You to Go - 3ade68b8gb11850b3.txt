I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO

Here I am alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dreams just walked away
I'm holding on where have all the passion's gone

[Chorus:]
(And from the start)
Maybe I was trying too hard
It's crazy 'cause it's breaking my heart
Things can fall apart, but I know
That I don't want you to go

Heroes die and don't know the cause inside
But feeling from what's left behind
They fight for something else
And so it goes that we have both learned how to grow

[Chorus:]
And from the start)
Maybe I was trying too hard
It's crazy 'cause it's breaking my heart
Things can fall apart, but I know
That I don't want you to go

It's just too hard
Taking on the whole world all by myself
For there's not enough
Unless I start trusting somebody else
Somebody else in love again

[Chorus:]
(And from the start)
Maybe I was trying too hard
It's crazy 'cause it's breaking my heart
Things can fall apart, but I know
That I don't want you to go

Oh no, don't want you to go
Say that you won't go
