RESTLESS HEART

You are my shining star
I knew it from the start
You keep my restless heart

I didn
I didn
But this is an explosion
I only need your kiss and touch

Feel how my heart is beating
When you
You send my senses thrilling (?)
As I come to know what love can be

Tell me if this spell I
Has been put on you
Show me that you want me forever


You are my shining star
I knew it from the start
You keep my restless heart
(You keep my restless heart)
I give it all to you
Do what you want me to
You keep my restless heart

There never is a minute
When I don
My passion knows no limit


Tell me if this spell I
Has been put on you
Show me that you want me forever
We can make this dream come true

You are my shining star
I knew it from the start
You keep my restless heart
(You keep my restless heart)
I give it all to you
Do what you want me to
You keep my restless heart

OOh baby
OOh darling

You are my shining star
I knew it from the start
You keep my restless heart
I give it all to you
Do what you want me to
You keep my restless heart
(You keep my restless heart)

You are my shining star
