NO MORE DRAMA

You put my face on ah cover of ah magazine
Spreading rumors that are so obscene
True or false the storys never rental clean
She said this, she did that too

Use to think I was dumb enough to hurt my ass
I don't care is your ass getting this?
Yeah, you got your fifthteen minutes worth of fame
Smarter now I got your game

You made me out to be a drama queen
Crazy & insane is what they thought of me
I never knew just what to do you try & hurt me
Now the drama's through

(Chorus:)
No drama
No drama
No drama
No more drama
How could you do this to me
No more drama
Had enough of that
No drama
No drama
No drama
No more drama
Now why won't you let me be
No more drama
Had enough of that

I always kept a smile on my interviews
One false move & I be black 'n' blue
And then so quiet
I had a lot of healing to do
Done with that
Those are the facts

Now I'm free to do the things I wanna do
Doesn't matter what I have been through
My career is the only thing I answer to
Like Janet said I'm in control

Never believe all the things you hear
Gossip sells so they don't care
I never thought I make it, but I did
Over now the drama's through

(Repeat Chorus:)
No drama
No drama
No drama
No more drama
How could you do this to me
No more drama
Had enough of that
No drama
No drama
No drama
No more drama
Now why won't you let me be
No more drama
Had enough of that

(Echo Voice)
Wake Up
Wake Up
Wake Up

(Echo Voice)
Wake Up
Wake Up
Wake Up

(Repeat Chorus:)
No drama
No drama
No drama
No more drama
How could you do this to me
No more drama
Had enough of that
No drama
No drama
No drama
No more drama
Now why won't you let me be
No more drama
Had enough of that
