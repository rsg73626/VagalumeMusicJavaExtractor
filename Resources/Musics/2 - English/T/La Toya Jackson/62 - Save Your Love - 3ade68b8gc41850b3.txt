SAVE YOUR LOVE

Save your love, save your love
Save your love, save your love
(Lock it up, send me the key)
(Save it, save it, save it your love, save your love)

Time has come to hit the highway
You know how much I want to stay
But I've got bills I've gotta pay
You know that I'll be back some day
So don't give what's mine away
Lock it up

Save your love, save your love
Save your love, save your love
(Lock it up, send me the key)
(Save it, save it, save it your love, save your love)

I really do hate to leave town
'Cause the minute my plane is off the ground
My friends will come hanging around
But baby don't let them break you down
Keep your love just for me
Lock it up

Save your love, save your love
Save your love, save your love
(Lock it up, send me the key)
(Save it, save it, save it your love, save your love)

Save it, save it, save it, save it, save it

Life on the road will be tough
And sleeping alone will be rough
'Cause I've grown so used to your touch
Babe, I'm gonna miss you much too much
But knowing your way is enough
Lock it up

Save your love, save your love
Save your love, save your love
(Lock it up, send me the key)
(Save it, save it, save it your love, save your love)

Save your love, save your love
Save your love, save your love
(Lock it up, send me the key)
(Save it, save it, save it your love, save your love)

Save your love, save your love
Save your love, save your love
(Lock it up, send me the key)
(Save it, save it, save it your love, save your love)
