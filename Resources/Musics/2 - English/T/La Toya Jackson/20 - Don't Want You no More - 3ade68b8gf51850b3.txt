DON'T WANT YOU NO MORE

You better stop, you better stop doggin' me
Stalkin' me, callin' me
You better stop, you better stop doggin' me

You better stop, you better stop doggin' me
Stalkin' me, callin' me
You better stop, you better stop doggin' me

You tell me you're in love with Toy
Do what you do wrong boy
Hangin' out with your crew, doggin' me
Why do you do the things you do?

Sittin' here all alone
Talkin' on my telephone
Uh uh, when I'm coming home, doggin' me
Why do you do the things you do?

Uh uh oh boy, why did you have to do it this way?
Uh uh oh boy, why did you have to go and play?

I, say I, bye bye, don't want you no more
I, oh I, bye bye, are we finished, go boy
I, I, I, I, I, don't want you no more
I, say I, I don't want you no more

Know you're not my lover
Seekin' for another
Now I'm undercover, stalkin' me
Why do you do the things you do?

Tighten my security
Can't get you way from me
Psycho, stay away from me, stalkin' me
Why do you do the things you do?

Uh uh oh boy, why did you have to do it this way?
Uh uh oh boy, why did you have to go and play?

I, say I, bye bye, don't want you no more
I, oh I, bye bye, are we finished, go boy
I, I, I, I, I, don't want you no more
I, say I, I don't want you, don't want you, don't want you

You better stop, you better stop doggin' me
Stalkin' me, callin' me, you S. O. B. !
I can't believe, that you was just playin' me
Cheatin' me, usin' me, no thank you, please

You better stop, you better stop doggin' me
Stalkin' me, callin' me, you S. O. B. !
I can't believe, that you was just playin' me
Cheatin' me, usin' me, you know you wanna be

I, say I, bye bye, don't want you no more
I, oh I, bye bye, are we finished, go boy
I, I, I, I, I, don't want you no more
I, say I, I don't want you no more

I, say I, bye bye, don't want you no more
I, oh I, bye bye, are we finished, go boy
I, I, I, I, I, don't want you no more
