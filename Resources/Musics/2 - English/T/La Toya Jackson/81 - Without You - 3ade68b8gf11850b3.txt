WITHOUT YOU

Dear darling
Im writing this letter to let you know
That I cant live my life without, so please please dont go
Love Latoya

Seems like it was just the other day
(Love came my way)
Thinking about the wonderful time, we shared
(We had no cares)
Now it seems as thought the flame is gone
(And it shows)
I tried to hold back my tears
(Over flowed)
Never thought that I would see the day
I cant gone on this waywithout you
(Holding you, wanting you)
Ooh no
(Needing you)
Cant live my life without you
(Loving you, holding you)
Please dont go
(Wanting you)
(Cant live my life without you)

Many nights I set aching all alone
(Waiting by the phone)
Hoping you would call if Im alone
(Please dont leave me)
I never thought that you would leave me there
(Please dont go)
I never thought that it would be this way
(Now I know)
You are my heart, my soul each pray I make
Cant go on this way
Without you

(Holding you, wanting you)
Ooh no
(Needing you)
Cant live my life without you
(Loving you, holding you)
Please dont go
(Wanting you)

You are the one who give me hope live
You taught me love you taught me how to forgive
You gave me strength in love when I was down
And now I need you but you cant be found

(Holding you, wanting you)
(Needing you)
Cant live my life without you
(Loving you, holding you)
Please dont go
(Wanting you)

(Cant live without you)
(Come back to me)
(Theres no tomorrow)
(Come back to me)
(Cant live without you)
(Come back to me)
(Theres no tomorrow)
