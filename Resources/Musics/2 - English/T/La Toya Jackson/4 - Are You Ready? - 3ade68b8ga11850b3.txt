ARE YOU READY?

Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready? (Let's go)

Baby, oh baby, we're going out tonight
Meet me at ten thirty, yeah
And we'll get into flight

What we gonna go
We're going to a party
Seven and fifty-two
That's where we're gonna start
Saturday rendezvous love city
Gotta get funky, too
We'll tear that place apart

Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready? (Let's go)

Baby, oh baby, I'm feeling mighty hot
Touch me, I'm yearning
For something that you got

Temperature's moving up
Feel the boogie power
Taking it to the top
Hey, babye, we're getting down now
When are we gonna stop
Come to see our world
When are they gonna drop
It's the hottest place in town

Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready? (Let's go)

Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready? (Let's go)

Temperature's moving up
Feel the boogie power
Taking it to the top
Hey babye, we're getting down now
When are we gonna stop
Come to see our world
When are they gonna drop
It's the hottest place in town

Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready? (Let's go)
