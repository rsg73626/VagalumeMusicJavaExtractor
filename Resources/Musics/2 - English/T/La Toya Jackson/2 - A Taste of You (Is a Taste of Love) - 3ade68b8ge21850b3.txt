A TASTE OF YOU (IS A TASTE OF LOVE)

Walking through the park
A kiss in the dark
Just holding hands
See what it means to me

Laying under the stars at night
Dinner by candle light
My kind of plans
In your arms of love
That's where I'll find it
No, I'm not blinded

Hunger for your love
And all I wanted was a little taste
I thought it would be enough
'Till I got my arms around your waist
Hooked on the taste of you

Just the taste of you
Is a taste of love
A taste of you
Just a taste of you
Is a taste of love
Is a taste of love
(A taste of you)
(Is just not enough)

Riding horses on the trail
Finding old sea shells
Building castles in the sand
Oh, how heavenly

I'd board a ferry for you
That's the way I feel
Girl, every moment when I'm with you
There's always something new
I need your taste but
I been looking for a truer thing
You'll be mine for sure
That's when I will look back and say
Hooked on the taste of you

Just the taste of you
Is a taste of love
A taste of you
Just a taste of you
Is a taste of love
Is a taste of love
(A taste of you)
(Is just not enough)

In these changing times
It's hard to find a love that's real
When love's on the line
You gave me love that I can feel
Hooked on the taste of you

Just the taste of you
Is a taste of love
A taste of you
Just a taste of you
Is a taste of love
Is a taste of love
(A taste of you)
(Is just not enough)
