BOYS GOT SOMETHIN' GIRLS AIN'T GOT

There was a full moon in the sky
The girls and me were hanging out
Just watching the boys go by
Call it curiosity, say I can't resist
I made a new discovery when I got my first kiss
Boys got somethin' girls ain't got
Drives 'em crazy, makes 'em so hot
Boys got somethin'
Boys got somethin' girls ain't got
Like a bee that needs its honey
Like a moth drawn to the flame
Ya can't escape the facts of life
We're captured by the game
And that's the way it's been since Adam and Eve
Just one look was all it took to make a girl believe
Boys got somethin' girls ain't got
Drives 'em crazy, makes 'em so hot
Boys got somethin'
Boys got somethin' girls ain't got
