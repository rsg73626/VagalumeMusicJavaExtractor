FEELS LIKE LOVE

I just wanna see the lights
And nothing else matters to me
Tonight don't start a fight
Just let go, release
I usually keep the base
Tonight I'm a beast
Look so innocent
But tonight I'll be a freak

[Chorus:]
There we dance, oh
Music but it feels like love
There we dance slow
It takes my body and I lose control
Yes, we dance oh
Music but it feels like love
There we dance slow
Music but it feels like?
La la la love
Love

Make me sweat
Hope we're doing what we doing I forget
That we're on the floor
So keep doing what you're doing, baby all night long
You know that turns me on

[Chorus:]
There we dance, oh
Music but it feels like love
There we dance slow
It takes my body and I lose control
Yes, we dance oh
Music but it feels like love
There we dance slow
Music but it feels like?
La la la love
Love

Don't put me out
? Cause that'd be cold
It gets me high
When I feel alone
Do it do do do it
Do it do do do it
? Cause I need it

[Spoken:]
I want everybody in every country
Stand up and do what I say

All the girls to the left
All the ladies to the right
All the people in the world
Get down tonight

All the girls to the left
All the ladies to the right
All the people in the world
Get down tonight

I just wanna have fun tonight, baby
Music but it feels like love
