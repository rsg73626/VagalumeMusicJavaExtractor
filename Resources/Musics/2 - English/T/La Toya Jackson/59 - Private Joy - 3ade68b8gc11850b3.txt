PRIVATE JOY

Get up!
(Oh--)

My little secret, my private joy
Who could never let another play with his toy
Youre my little sweetheart from heaven above
Oh, oh oh oh oh I think I'm falling in love
And he ain't gonna tell nobody nobody 'bout his little pretty toy

All the other girls would love to love him but hes my little private joy
My private joy - you're my private joy
Private joy such a, such a pretty boy
Joy, you are my private joy
