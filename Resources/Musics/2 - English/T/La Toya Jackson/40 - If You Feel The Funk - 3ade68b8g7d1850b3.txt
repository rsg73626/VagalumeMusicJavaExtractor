IF YOU FEEL THE FUNK

If you feel the funk shake your rump
Shake your rump to the funk
Won't you shake it
(If you feel the funk shake your rump)
(Shake your rump to the funk)
(Won't you shake it)
Now we all see that you're groovin' down yeah
That don't mean you can't sit around
Just sit around just get on down
Now I wanna see you shake it to me
If you feel the funk shake your rump
Shake your rump to the funk
Won't you shake it
(If you feel the funk shake your rump)
(Shake your rump to the funk)
(Won't you shake it)
Make you move to my funk
Just turn me on
I don't know you but I would love to
I can see you and me gettin' it on
Come iwth me let it be
Get down and party
If you feel the funk shake your rump
Shake your rump to the funk
Won't you shake it
I want to see, shake baby shake
Shake baby shake
Shake it don't break it
Don't just ckap your hands get up and dance
Shake it don't break it
Don't just ckap your hands get up and dance
Don't hold back what you feel in your soul
'Cause if that's where it's at boy it's good as gold
No don't be shy, no need to question why
If you feel the funk shake your rump
Shake your rump to the funk
Won't you shake it
(If you feel the funk shake your rump)
(Shake your rump to the funk)
(Won't you shake it)
