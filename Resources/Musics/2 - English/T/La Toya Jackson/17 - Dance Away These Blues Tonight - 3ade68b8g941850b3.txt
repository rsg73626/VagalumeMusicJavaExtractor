DANCE AWAY THESE BLUES TONIGHT

Well my man just called me up
Said he's workin' late
Said he felt real bad to have to break our date
What kind of fool does he think I am
I know full well he made other plans
He's done this too many times for me to take

I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight
I'm gonna break all the rules tonight
Hang up my high heel shoes
Slip into some boots
I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight

I'm gonna grab the phone and call up all of my friends
We'll go dancing all night
Because tonight the fun begins
Instead of staying home feeling down
I'll be out making the rounds
A couple of cowboys on each arm
How do you do

I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight
I'm gonna break all the rules tonight
Hang up my high heel shoes
Slip into some boots
I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight

Once I hit that dance floor
You won't get me off the floor
I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight
I'm gonna break all the rules tonight
Hang up my high heel shoes
Slip into some boots
I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight

I'm gonna dance away these blues tonight
