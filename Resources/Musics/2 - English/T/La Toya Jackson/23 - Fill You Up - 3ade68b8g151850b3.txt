FILL YOU UP

[Chorus:]
Let me fill you up with my lovin'
Fill you up, fill you up baby
Let me fill you up with my lovin'
Fill you up, fill you full of joy, boy
Fill you up

Feel that feling running deep inside
It's a love's sensation that you just can't hide
Give me loving that's above leing, c'mon baby
Let me ease your mind
So when you're down and out and you're feling low
Heading home with nothing to do
Let me tell you baby what I'm thinking of
I got something just for you

[Chorus:]
Let me fill you up wih my lovin'
Fill you up, fill you up baby
Let me fill you up with my lovin'
Fill you up, fill you full of joy, boy
Fill you up

When your heart aches keep you up at night
Don't hesitate to call me, I'll be your heart's delight
Just reach out and hold my hand
He won't have to be a lonely man
I know how to give special love to you

Give me a chance, you've got nothing to lose
So when you're down and out and you're feeling low
Sitting home with nothing to do
And there's a special love that you need tonight
To give you and I got it's got to be right

[Chorus add lib:]
Let me fill you up with my lovin'
Fill you up, fill you up baby
Let me fill you up with my lovin'
Fill you up, fill you full of joy, boy
Fill you up
