PIANO MAN

I see your fingers flying up and down
Skillfully you play your tunes
Everything you do is wonderful
Everything has got mood
You hold your future in your hands
(In your hands)
Every night you work until the dawn
You play piano all night long
After work you write your songs at home
And they sound so strong
Yes, you've got your future in your hands
And I believe you'll make it, piano man
You still play "Reet Petite"
Or "Driver's Seat"
Sometimes "Funky Town"
"Upside Down"
But your time will come, piano man
You've got your future in your hands
In your hands
(In your hands)
I know it's such a long, long way to go
But never ever give it up
If you only keep it goin' strong
You'll gonna hit the town
Yes, you've got your future in your hands
And I believe you'll make it, piano man
You still play "Reet Petite"
Or "Driver's Seat"
Sometimes "Funky Town"
"Upside Down"
But your time will come, piano man
You've got your future in your hands
In your hands
"Funky Town"
"Upside Down"
But your time will come, piano man
