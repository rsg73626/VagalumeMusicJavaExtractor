BOOTS

You keep saying you've got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
You've been messin' where you shouldn't have been messin'
And now someone else is gettin' all your best

These boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep lying, when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep loosin' when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be changin'
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin
And you keep thinkin' that you will never get burnt
I just found me a brand new box of matches
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn

And my boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready boots? start walkin'!
