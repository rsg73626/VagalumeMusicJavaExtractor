SUMMERTIME WITH YOU

Summertime with you
Doing what you wanna do
Take a trip in the park
Even when it's dark
Ooh baby, we can go to the zoo
Only me and you
Something else to do
Summertime with you
The sunshine makes me happy
With you I'm so happy
Can't you see in me
The sunshine makes it right
(It's always nice at night)
(Everything's gonna be fine)
In the summertime, in the summertime
Summertime with you
Gotta find something to do
Walking on the beach
Water on your feet
Watching sail boats
Standing on the coast
With the beautiful winds
Summertime again
Summertime with you
Is the best time of the year
For me, baby, can't you see
I feel so good inside
Everything is gonna be fine
In the summertime, in the summertime
Summertime with you, baby
Summertime with you
Summertime with you, baby
Summertime with you
