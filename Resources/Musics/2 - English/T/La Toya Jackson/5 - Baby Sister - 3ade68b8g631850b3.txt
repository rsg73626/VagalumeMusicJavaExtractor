BABY SISTER

I've heard the rumors goin' round the twon
You think you're playin' me for a fool
But eveybody's seen you sneakin' around
You and baby sister thinkin' you're so cool
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
The trouble started when I brought you home
To meet my friends and family
The love you had for me went right out the door
When you saw my baby sister in her tight blue jeans
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
Well, I know I shouldn't be blamin' only you
I'm sure my baby sister player her part
But then the worst of my nightmares all came true
Just like a knife in my heart
I saw you both in the dark
Baby sister
So when you take her to your mountaintop
To show her what your love's about
I hope the moon is shinin' extra bright
'Cause that's where you'll be livin' when my Daddy finds out
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
She's so cool in her tight blue jeans
Gonna be in trouble when our Daddy finds out
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
You used to love me till you met my baby sister
