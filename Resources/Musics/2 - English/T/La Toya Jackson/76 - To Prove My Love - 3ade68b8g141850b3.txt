TO PROVE MY LOVE

I'm gonna prove it to you
I'm gonna prove it to you

Prove my love
To prove my love

Let's go

You love me, so you say
But you need time to remain
You've gotta find a way to trust me
I'm not gonna go
I'm not gonna leave

All that I can do
To get you to come to this
All that I can say
To show you what I mean

To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love
To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love

Let's go

Suspicious minds are alone ones
Thinking all the time
Let me set your mind at ease
Come on, baby
Won't you come on, baby

All that I can do
To keep on trying, babe
All that I can say
It's what you do to me

To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love
To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love

To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love
To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love

Let's go

I'm gonna prove it to you
I'm gonna prove it to you
I'm gonna prove it to you

Let's go

I'm gonna prove it to you
To prove my love
To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love

To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love
To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love

To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love
To prove my love (I'm gonna prove it to you)
To prove my love
