HEART DON'T LIE

Nobody try things hide
From what you feel inside
(Repeat 4 times)

Five long months we've been going steady
I know it seems like a long time
When I ask the question you say you're not ready
I'm sure it's time for this right now

Don't try to hide it
With words that just aren't true
It's showing in your eyes
I see it, so do you

(Cuz your) Heart don't lie
You can tell me any old thing
Heart don't lie
It won't let you be deceiving
You know your heart don't lie

I don't want your life, just want to share it
Want the same thing, though I just don't know
So throw away your mask and set your heart free
Love's a masquerade, girl, can't you see

Why try to hide it 
With words that just aren't true?
You know you want me 
'Cause I feel it and so do you

(Cuz your) Heart don't lie
You can tell me any old thing
Heart don't lie
It won't let you be deceiving
Heart don't lie
You can tell me any old thing
Heart don't lie
It won't let you be deceiving

Brother, you're looking nice
Love me, and your heart don't lie
