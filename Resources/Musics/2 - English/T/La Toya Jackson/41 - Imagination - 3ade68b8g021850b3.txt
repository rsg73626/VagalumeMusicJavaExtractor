IMAGINATION

I don't know why
I try to hide
The feelings that I have inside
I shouldn't wait
Might be too late
He's moving fast
And leaving no trace
He could show me
Oh so I've heard
A really exciting time
Don't fall in love
Or play for keeps
He just wants to keep blowing my mind
He's gotta lotta
Imagination
Never a boring moment with him
(Repeat)
Last night he took me for a ride
In his futuristic car
Of the year
He's moving fast
I hope it last
I was having the time of my life
He looked at me a sexy smile
And said you better hold on tight
Don't fall in love or play for keeps
He just wants to keep blowing my mind
He's gotta lotta
Imagination
Never a boring moment with him
(Repeat)
I often wondered what it
Would be like sitting on the
Crust of the moon
