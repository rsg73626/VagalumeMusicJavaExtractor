FRUSTATION

Boy, my mind is in a tail-spin
Trying to figure out which way this madness will end
Do you want my love, do you want love, to refuse
I can't stand the pain no more my mind is so confused

You bring me frustration
Let me say that up-up and down
Tricky situation
Frustration
Do you want my love
So much frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
Dont know what you're doing to me
Do you want my love?

Don't want to hear no more sweet talk
It's not the place and time
Can't keep on hanging on
My life is on a thin line
I get a feeling it's a hopeless situation
We've come to a dead-end street
And what you had goin' wasn't that bad
But you can't see the forest for the trees

You bring me frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
Tricky situation
Frustration
Do you want my love?

Frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
Tricky situation
Frustration
Do you want my love?
So much frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
I dont know what you're doing to me
Do you want my love?

Sometimes I sit and remember (I remember)
What we had was so sweet
It's really strange how love changes

But now the time has come
All that's left is to say goodbye
Been through so many changes
Can't even bring myself to cry
You know it's really a shame
That I can't stay with you nomore
We had a love so true but now all I want you to do
Is hit the door, hit the door, hit the door
Gotta hit the door ohh
Don't want you no more

You bring me Frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
I dont know what you're doing to me (dont know what youre doing to me--)
Do you want my love? (Do you really want my love?)
Frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
Tricky situation
Do you want my love? (Do you really, do you really want my love?)
Frustration
Let me say that up-up and down (up and down)
I dont know what you're doing to me (do you? --)
Do you want my love? (do you baby?)
Do you really want my love?
Frustration
Yeah!
