IF I AIN'T GOT IT

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
If I ain't got it
(You don't need it)

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
If it's not there
It's not for you
If I ain't got it
Because it's always better
Wen I get through

I spent my life preparing for
A lover just like you
So come on in and close the door
I know just what to do

No need to look no further boy
You'll find no greener grass
But once you step inside my world
Can it be your at home at last

Whatever you want
I know how to give it
Whatever you feel
I know how to care
Whatever you need
I know how to get it
Before you have to call me
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be right there

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
If it's not there
It's not for you
If I ain't got it
Because it's always better
Wen I get through

I'll be there
When I get through
I'll be right there

I know you wanna be convinced
About my self-description
Before you lower your defense
And follow my perscription

But am I gonna steer you wrong
Right here is where you find it
Don't fight it, boy, it's much too strong
Just put some faith behind it

Whatever you want
I know how to give it
Whatever you feel
I know how to care
Whatever you need
I know how to get it
Before you hae to call me
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be right there

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
If I ain't got it
(You don't need it)

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
If it's not there
It's not for you
If I ain't got it
Because it's always better
Wen I get through

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
I got everything you want
I got everything you need
It's right here
I'm telling you, boy
You sure don't need it
Come on give my love a try
I'm sure to satisfy

If I ain't got it
You don't need it
If I ain't got it
(You don't need it)
