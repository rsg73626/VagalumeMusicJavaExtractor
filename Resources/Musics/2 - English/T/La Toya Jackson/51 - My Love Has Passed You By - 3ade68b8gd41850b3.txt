MY LOVE HAS PASSED YOU BY

I needed you to care
But you were never there
I needed you to love me right
And all you did was saying goodnight
Tried so many times to understand your mind
But you just made a fool of me
And it was very plain to see

Now you wonder why my love has passed you by
Now you wonder why my love has passed you by

You say your story's changed
And you are not the same
All you needed was some time
So you could clear things in your mind
But you stayed just the same
I got tired of your game
Your lies don't want no more
Now I'm walking out the door

Now you wonder why my love has passed you by
Now you wonder why my love has passed you by

Now you wonder why my love has passed you by
Now you wonder why my love has passed you by

I needed you to care
But you were never there
Your story's changed
You're not the same
Your lies don't work no more
I'm walking out the door

Now you wonder why my love has passed you by
Now you wonder why my love has passed you by
