HE'S A PRETENDER

He appears to be straight from heaven
But everybody says there's a devil in those angel eyes
They try me on for size
He opens his mouth and there's magic
A beautiful smile and looks that goes on for days
But everybody says, they say

He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
Out to take your heart tonight
He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
Out to take your heart tonight

Might as well be mine
Pretender take mine

Well, I might be crazy but out on the floor
This guy's moving like he wants to do more than dance
I think I'll take a chance
He moves in close for a slow one
And I can't believe what he's whispering in my ear
His words were so sincere
Ooh, how can they say

He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
Out to take your heart tonight
(H'es just a pretender)
He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
Out to take your heart tonight

Might as well be mine
Pretender take mine

He's just a pretender
Just a pretender
He's just a pretender

My heart was made for the loving, boy
Not for breaking
So if you think you're gonna hurt me, boy
You're mistaken

I turn around and my angel was gone
I couldn't believe he would leave my love high and dry
Tell me the reason why
Please tell me

He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
Out to take your heart tonight
(He's just a pretender)
He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
He's out to take your heart tonight
(Just a pretender)

He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
He doesn't mean a word of it
(He's just a pretender)
He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
He's out to take my heart tonight, oh, oh
(Just a pretender)

He's just a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
He's out to take your heart, out to take your heart
(He's just a pretender)
He's a pretender doesn't mean a word of it
He's out to take your heart tonight
