SOMEWHERE

Once upon a time there were two people so in love
That nothing in the world could break the spell
Then they woke up from the dream and we went our separate ways
But through the years I always love you
I spend my whole life dreaming of you

But I believe in the love we have was meant to be
And I pray that you get the same feeling when you think of me
And I know that
Somewhere we'll be together
Somehow we will meet again
We had a love of a lifetime
How could we let it end?

Somewhere we'll be together
Somehow, someway
'Cause I will never stop loving you, ooh
And I know that you're waiting there
Somewhere

Maybe I'm a fool for holding on so long
But I never felt the way I did with you
When I close my eyes it's just a day once more
And we're laughing in the rain together
And dancing on our cloud for ever more
You say you found a special love just in time
So baby if I have to wait forever I don't mind
'Cause I know that
Somewhere we'll be together
Somehow we will meet again
We had a love of a lifetime
How could we let it end?

Somewhere we'll be together
Somehow, someway
'Cause I will never stop loving you
And I know that you're waiting there
Somewhere
OOh, somewhere
