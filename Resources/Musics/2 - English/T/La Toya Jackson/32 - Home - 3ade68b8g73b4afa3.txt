HOME

When I?m all alone, I get this feeling
It always makes me cry, it?s one I can no longer hide
Missing all the years that we all shared at home
The silly things we did, laughing, from early dusk to
dawn
I remember when, we were all best friends?

Home, it was so many years ago
Parted by the fame we grew to only know
It was true when they say the show must go
Many years that we let pass
Life?s not fair but I know our love will always last
We sing on, the memories we all once had

When I?m all alone, I think of our busy lives
Traveling place to place, we must have met with
family, it was nice
Joker missed you to, and all the fun we had
Never parted a day until we, we went our separate
ways
I remember when, we were all best friends?

Home, it was so many years ago
Parted by the fame we grew to only know
It was true when they say the show must go
Many years that we let pass
Life?s not fair but I know our love will always last
We sing on, the memories we all once had

Home, it was so many years ago (so many years)
Parted by the fame we grew to only know
It was true when they say the show must go
Many years that we let pass
Life?s not fair but I know our love will always last
We sing on, the memories we all once had

So don?t you tell me that I know what I?m feelin?
And don?t you tell me that I?m dreamin?
Like Mother always said, your family will always be
there for you
It don?t have to be this way, let?s make tomorrow a
much, much brighter day
And don?t let this time between us, slip away

Just slip away?

Home, it was so many years ago
Parted by the fame we grew to only know
It was true when they say the show must go
Many years that we let pass
Life?s not fair but I know our love will always last
We sing on, the memories we all once had

Home, it was so many years ago
Parted by the fame we grew to only know (grew to only
know)
It was true when they say the show must go
Many years that we let pass (so many years)
Life?s not fair but I know our love will always last
We sing on, the memories we all once had
The memories we all once had
