SHOULD'VE LEFT YOU

A-ha-ha-ha, A-ha-ha baby
A-ha-ha-ha, A-ha-ha baby

A trench coat with a pimp stare
Came into my life and tried to ruin it from there
And I got sick of all your games and lies
A smack here, and a smack there
"You're not supposed to say just what you want"
And I feared for life
Because of your bets and threats and bribes

You can blame it on my parents
You can blame it on the fact that I'm a Jack
You can call it what you want
Yeah, it hurt, but I bounced right back

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
And you control me with my own finance
I don't know what I was thinking

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
I was your puppet and you made me dance
Strings are cut and now I'm living

A-ha-ha-ha, A-ha-ha baby

You know you didn't get away with this 'cause
In your small world
You're just without the Miss (nothin' without the Miss)
And if you think that I am
Gonna sit around and take your sh1t
Then you must be thinkin' that I am
Still your bill-payin' fool

You can blame it on my parents
You can blame it on the fact that I'm a Jack
You can call it what you want
Yeah, it hurt, but I bounced right back

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
And you control me with my own finance
I don't know what I was thinking

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
I was your puppet and you made me dance
Strings are cut and now I'm living

Hypnotized by your lies
Playboy made me cry, broke out in hives
Leavin' me, scarin' me, on my knees
Beggin' please, don't hit me please

Couldn't run out the door
'Cause you stole my ends
And then you stole my freakin' Benz

You S. O. B., you f'd with me, you shoulda be a thankin' me, 'cause you were so damn poor
You S. O. B., you f'd with me, you shoulda be a thankin' me, you S. O. B., and know you'll never be

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
And you control me with my own finance
I don't know what I was thinking

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
I was your puppet and you made me dance
Strings are cut and now I'm living

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
And you control me with my own finance
I don't know what I was thinking

I should've left you but I had no chance
A profit to you with the size of my pants
I was your puppet and you made me dance
Strings are cut and now I'm living

A-ha-ha-ha, A-ha-ha baby

Did you get her?
No, boss, I'm sorry... she got away
