JUST SAY NO

Just say no (No) say no
Everybody say no, say no
Just say no (No) say no

Brothers and sisters
What are you cryin' for
People are dyin'
What are they dyin' for
You got to be so strong
Don't let 'em lead you on
And take you in
Into their misery

There's a chance you just can't take
It's a game no one should play
The future is in your hands
If you just say no


Don't let them guide you
Don't put that stuff inside you
Don't let 'em take control
Just say no

And don't take it from the fools
And no one else in school
You can be really cool
If you just say no


Just Say No

No!


Just say no (No) say no
Everybody say no, say no
