WEAK SPOT

Boy, you're very charming
Somthing 'bout your style
I find alarming
Mother always told me to remember
Everyone that smiles is not your friend, girl
No, you can't fool me with flattery
What you want and love have different destinies
I think you're right by my weak spot
True love it's not
Stuck in my heart's door
Try to pick the lock
You try to get to my weak spot
It's a real cheap shot
Out to please yourself
And take all I've got
No, no likely matter
There's an awesome price on what you're after
Standbys camouflage your true desires
Just to drain your heart they become liars
No, you can't fool me with your flattery
You see, what you want and love have different destinies
I think you're right by my weak spot
True love it's not
Stuck in my heart's door
Try to pick the lock
You try to get to my weak spot
It's a real cheap shot
Out to please yourself
And take all I've got
Is it really me or just the moment
Could it be I'm just another woman
Tell your heart what you're investing
Mine is one what you will not be testing
I think you're right by my weak spot
True love it's not
Stuck in my heart's door
Try to pick the lock
You're trying to get to my weak spot
It's a real cheap shot
Out to please yourself
And take all I've got
I know what you're after
I'm certainly not blind
You only use me
I've seen your kind
Uh huh
I think he's after my weak spot
True love it's not
I think he's after my weak spot
Take all you've got
I think you're after my weak spot
True love it's not
Stuck in my heart's door
Try to pick the lock
You're trying to get to my weak spot
It's a real cheap shot
Out to please yourself
And take all I've got
