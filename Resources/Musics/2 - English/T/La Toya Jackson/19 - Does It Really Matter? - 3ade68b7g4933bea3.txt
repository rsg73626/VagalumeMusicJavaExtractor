DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

You're just a victim to love

Do you think he's worth it
To try and act so perfect
Someone who doesn't even care
You were always honest
You never broke your promise
The situation is unfair

It's a quarter to eight
And your baby is late
Come party with me
And if he tries to explain
Will you let him remain
A part of your life

Does he really need you
And did he really please you
Does it really matter now
Does he really need you
And did he really please you
Does it really matter now

If he really loves you
He'll put no one above you
Now tell me if it's right or wrong
Playin' with the best
And eatin' with the rest
His game has gone on much too long


You're just a victim to love
Looky here

Why don't you, why don't you

You're just a victim to love
(Scratch)

You're just a victim to love
(Scratch)
