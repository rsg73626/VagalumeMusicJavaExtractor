HE'S MY BROTHER

Mmm, Mmm
Owwww!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Uh Uh, He's not bad!

You may say he's eccentric
I will admit that he's quite different
You may say he does crazy things (OhOhOh!)
He works hard for the money that he brings

Bad and Thriller, he's still the Man in The Mirror
Cause he's good to ME! And I know...
And I know
Yes I know that he loves me so

Cause he is my brother
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother (He's my brother)
He gives me emotion in plenty
When I'm alone...
... and I need him
He's with me like lightning
Cause he is my brother
And I love (and I love)
And I love, yes, I love him so

He-He-He's not bad! (He's not bad!)
Oww!
Out on stage he's electric
When he dances it's just like magic
And you know when he starts to sing (OhOhOh!)
He is reaching the world with his music

Bad and Thriller, he's still the Man in The Mirror
Cause he's good to ME!
And I know (and I know)
And I know cause he loves me so

Cause he is my brother (He's my Brother)
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother (Oh Yeah)
He gives me emotion in plenty
When I'm alone...
... and I need him
He's with me like lightning
Cause he is my brother
And I love (and I love)
And I love, yes, I love him so

He's not bad! (He-He-He's not bad!)
Oww!

Cause he is my brother (He's my Brother)
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother
He gives me emotion in plenty
When I'm alone...
... and I need him
He's with me like lightning
Cause he is my brother
And I love (and I love)
And I love yes I love him so 
Cause he is my brother (Oh yeah!)
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother (He's my Brother)
He gives me emotion in plenty
When...
