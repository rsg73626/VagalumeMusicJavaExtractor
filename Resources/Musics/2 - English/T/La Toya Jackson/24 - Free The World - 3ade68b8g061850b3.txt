FREE THE WORLD

We must bring an end to all discrimination
Let's free the world
And make a better place for children throughout the world
Why should they suffer from our battles
They are, our future
They are the voice of tomorrow

Divided by a land
Devastation's here at hand
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

United we must stand
In this war possessed by man
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

Years and years of war
Let's bring it to an end
All because of man
Why can't we put it into God's hands
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

Creation was his plan
Children learn and take a stand
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

(Chorus)
We're all God's creation
Across all nations
It's time for us
To come together as one
Let's free the world

Join your hands
Let's pray to him to save our land
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

Faith and love from up above
Will get us through
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

(Chorus)

(Chorus 2)
Let us end all discrimination
Across all nations
It's time for us
To come together as one
Let's free the world
But is it that simple

We are the future
The next generation
Please don't destroy
Just protect all nations
No more fears
Our future's clear
All this because of segregation
Education, communication will end discrimination
Let's free the world
Let's free the world

(Chorus)

(Chorus 2)

Let's make it simple
