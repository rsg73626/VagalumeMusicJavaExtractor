BAD GIRL

He's my lover, he's my best friend
Never want to lose him so I'm doing all I can
He's my baby, if I were you
I'd really keep my hands off all the nasty things you do

From time to time, you only play it hard
The cruel game is called a broken heart
Your losing what you got and I'm here to take away
Your still the guy

Bad girl, what'cha gonna do
Bad girl, shame on you
Bad girl, stealing my man
Bad girl, you catch the eye

You think it's easy to lead me on
You think you're invincible, your beauty is too strong
Thought I'm desperate
Don't get me wrong
I'm determined, I will show fight
Just to get you home

From time to time, you only play it hard
The cruel game is a broken heart
Your losing what you got and I'm here to take away
Your still the guy

Bad girl, what'cha gonna do
Bad girl, shame on you
Bad girl, stealing my man
Bad girl, you catch the eye

Bad girl, what'cha gonna do
I'd really keep my hands off all the nasty things you do
Bad girl, shame on you
He's my lover, he's my best friend
If I were you

Bad girl, what'cha gonna do
Bad girl, shame on you
Bad girl, stealing my guy
Bad girl, you catch the eye
