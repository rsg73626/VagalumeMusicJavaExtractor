LITTLE MISUNDERSTOOD

You tell me why it comes to this
Don't you get the picture
It was just a little kiss
You say you love me
You want my hand
Well, I ain't looking for a bore of a man
It wasn't love from where I stood
I'm just a little missunderstood

Misunderstood, so easily
Is this the way it will always be
I do the right things wrong
The wrong things good
I'm just a little miss, little miss, little missunderstood

Don't judge a cover by the book
Come a little closer and take another look
'Cause when you do
Then you will find
I'll be right there between the lines
Don't read me wrong
I know you could
I'm just a little missunderstood

Misunderstood, so easily
Is this the way it will always be
I do the right things wrong
The wrong things good
I'm just a little miss, little miss, little missunderstood

Misunderstood, so easily
Is this the way it will always be
I do the right things wrong
The wrong things good
I'm just a little miss, little miss, little missunderstood
