I'VE GOT TO BE BAD

I'm gonna open up the closet
And find something to wear
Something hot to make the men stop and stare
I've got places to go and people to see
Every cowboy's eyes will be fixed on me
It may seem naughty to the more refined
But I've got to be bad to have a good time
Yee-ha

I'm gonna meet my friends at a quarter till eight
We're going go dancing and I can't wait
We'll do some line dancing and two steps too
I'll spend all night scooting my boot scoot boogie
Me and my girls are partners in crime
And I've got to be bad to have a good time

I've got to be bad to have a good time
Gotta find a good man and make him mine
Like no other, I'm one of a kind
I've got to be bad to have a good time

I'm gonna open up the closet

I've got to be bad to have a good time
Gotta find a good man and make him mine
Like no other, I'm one of a kind
I've got to be bad to have a good time

Like no other, I'm one of a kind
I've got to be bad to have a good time

Like no other, I'm one of a kind
I've got to be bad to have a good time
