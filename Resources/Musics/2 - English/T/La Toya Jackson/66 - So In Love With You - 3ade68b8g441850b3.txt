SO IN LOVE WITH YOU

Remember when I met you
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do
That was the reason why I fell in love with you
(Yeah, I like this)
You brought me roses when you came by
When I was sick, stood by my side
That's when I met you
You were always with me when I cried
Read me your poems 'till my tears dried
That's when I met you
I never met anyone like this before
One who cares for me like my family
I never met anyone like this before
One who wants to spend his life with me
And don't want anything more
Remember when I met you
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do
That was the reason why I fell in love with you
Remember when I met you
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do
That is the reason why I'm so in love with you
I knew that you were the only one
Got me out on my show made me had fun
That's why I love you
I'll do anything just for you
'Cause you proved you love to be true
That's why I love you
I never met anyone like this before
One who cares for me like my family
I never met anyone like this before
One who wants to spend his life with me
And don't want anything more
Remember when I met you
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do
That was the reason why I fell in love with you
Remember when I met you
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do
That is the reason why I'm so in love with you
Remember when I met you (So in love, so in love)
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do (So in love, so in love)
That was the reason why I fell in love with you
Remember when I met you (So in love, so in love)
What you said, what you did, what you wouldn't do (So in love, so in love)
That is the reason why I'm so in love with you
La la la, my heart goes la la la, la la la
La la la, my heart goes la la la, ooh la la la
La la la, my heart goes la la la, la la la
La la la, my heart goes la la la, ooh la la la
So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
Yeah
