BE MY LOVER

Well let me tell you boy
I never thought I could get any higher, higher
Looking out, I was looking for love
Looking hard, till I felt my eyes getting tired, tired
But now I feel how you're lifting my heart
I can see that you know about love, by
That gentle feeling when I'm wrapped in your arms
Be my lover - I want to touch your loving hands
Be my lover - I'll give you everything I am
I feel a fever - and a chill all down my spine
Getting closer, closer, closer
I can't believe - love feels the way it's supposed to
I know you could tear me apart
Something told me from the moment we met
You're gonna take good care of my heart
Well, let me tell you, boy
I never thought I can get any higher, higher
Lookin'
Trying hard
But now I feel how you
I can see that you know about love
That you
Be my lover, I wanna touch your loving hands
Be my lover, I give you everything I am
I feel the fever
When the chill goin
Getting closer, closer
I can
Love feels just the way it supposed to
With you, with you
I know you know you can tear me apart
Yes, I
And I
Be my lover (Do want a lover)
I wanna touch your loving hands
Be my lover (Do want a lover)
I give you everything I am
Be my lover (Do want a lover)
I wanna touch your loving hands
Be my lover (Do want a lover)
Let me give you everything I am
Be my lover
