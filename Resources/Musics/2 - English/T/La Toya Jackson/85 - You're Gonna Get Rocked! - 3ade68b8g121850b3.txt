YOU'RE GONNA GET ROCKED!

All right, for those of you who didn't believe
Roll up your sleeves
And if you're hangin' (Cool!)
And if you're not - (Leave!)
'Cause Latoya is throwin' down with her new
Sound! (In full effect.) So give me some
Respect. (Or we'll put you in check.) Kick it
Off, boys, it's time to get correct. (Bet!)

Think I better put you in check
You're showin' me much disrespect
You're gonna get rocked
This time you have gone too far
Gonna sock you when you're hot
And leave a scar
You're gonna get rocked

You ask me if I know what to do
Well homeboy, who in the hell
Are you talkin' to
You're gonna get rocked
I'm gonna hit you in the chest
With the best, feel the drums
Gonna know where I'm comin' from
You're gonna get rocked by me

You're gonna get rocked
You're gonna get rocked

No prisoners
I like it, get it up
You're gonna get rocked

Check the move
Check the time
Go for yours
As I'm goin' for mine
You're gonna get rocked
Throw your hands in the air
Let's break through
Keep movin' and groovin'
As a rockin' 'roo
I ain't gonna stop
Till I hit the top
Come on, Full Force
Let the beat drop

Won't slow down to throw down
I just mow down
Whoever stands in my way
That's the lowdown
A showdown when you're round
That's how we'll go round
Get your hands out of my face
Or we'll throw down
This is my house
And a party I'm givin'
Tell me (How the hell you livin')
You can't take or shake
The sounds I make
You're gonna get dissed
Unless you break

You're gonna get rocked
You're gonna get rocked
I like it
I ain't takin' no prisoners
I like it, get it up, boys
Keep goin'
You're gonna get rocked
You're gonna get rocked

You're gonna get rocked
