LOVE TALK

Take my hand
Come and enter wonderland
Oh boy, have I got plans
I'm gonna show what it's like to be a man
Come let me whisper in your ear
Something sweet that I know you want to hear
Just relax, settle back
I'm gonna give you all the natural facts
Let's talk love talk
(Love talking, sweet talking love talk)
(Talk that love talk, sweet talking love talk)
Sit right down and whisper in my ear
(Ah baby)
Don't be shy
Let me see you reach the sky
Sit back, it's a fact
I'm gonna whisper till you can't
Hold back
Your emotions, love and ecstasy
Don't be surprised, you know you want me
Oh baby, hold on tight
'Cause we can't do it for the rest of the night
Let's talk love talk
(Love talking, sweet talking love talk)
(Talk that love talk, sweet talking love talk)
Sit right down and whisper in my ear
(Ah baby)
Ah baby, say that again
You melt my heart, you know you're gonna win
Just relax, settle back
I'm gonna give you all the natural facts
Ah, whisper something sweet
Tell me things that's gonna make me weak
Hold me tight, it's alright
'Cause we can do it for the rest of the night
Let's talk love talk
(Love talking, sweet talking love talk)
(Talk that love talk, sweet talking love talk)
Sit right down and whisper in my ear
