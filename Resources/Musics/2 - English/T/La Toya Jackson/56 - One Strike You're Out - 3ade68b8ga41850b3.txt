ONE STRIKE YOU'RE OUT

Got home late last night
Said honey, I gotta talk to you
There's another woman that I've been looking at too
I don't mean she'll ever be more important than you
I've got a urgin' eye I wanna sleep with her too
I said listen, darling
I can see that you're torn
But before we go much further
I think that you should be warned
You know I'm not the kind of woman that will ever lie to you
I'll tell you how I feel and I'll talk to you

This ain't no baseball game
It ain't no three strikes you're out
Make your choice up front
And if it's her then you can count me out
'Cause I won't sacrifice my pride for your piece of mind
If it's her you want, well baby, one strike you're out

I know it's not the answer that you wanted to hear
But at least we know it now that it's perfectly clear
You got a choice to make between this woman and me
So keep your vows or I'll set you free

This ain't no baseball game
It ain't no three strikes you're out
Make your choice up front
And if it's her then you can count me out
'Cause I won't sacrifice my pride for your piece of mind
If it's her you want, well baby, one strike you're out

This ain't no baseball game
It ain't no three strikes you're out
Make your choice up front
And if it's her then you can count me out
'Cause I won't sacrifice my pride for your piece of mind
If it's her you want, well baby, one strike you're out

If it's her you want, well baby, one strike you're out
