GIVING YOU UP

Hello there, oh how I really tried talkin' to you
I came over there to catch your eye
'Cause you, you're the girl who listens
Into everything I'm talkin' 'bout
I've been waitin' now that we're here
To make some love and advance
Find a place where we can settle down
It's the first time, you know we just met
For the first time, love
Come on over here and speak to me
I came this far to be with you
I'd like for you to know the truth
To have you with me every day
I'll change my life in every way
I can't wait, oh, giving you up
Give you up, give you up
(I need your lovin' here with me tonight)
(I won't) oh, giving you up
Give you up, give you up
(I'll guarantee you I can make things right)
(I won't)
I'm not asking you, darlin', to give me up
I wouldn't do that to you
Why can't we wait 'till we go away
We can reach inside and find our hearts
Hey, you know you're the first
To go and follow me in here
I can't afford to give this up and let you down
No, girl
I'll tell you just the way I feel
I'm not the kind who lies to tease around
I need you love with me tonight
I'll make it right for you in every way
I can't wait, oh, giving you up
Give you up, give you up
(I need your lovin' here with me tonight)
(I won't) oh, giving you up
Give you up, give you up
(I'll guarantee you I can make things right)
(I won't)
