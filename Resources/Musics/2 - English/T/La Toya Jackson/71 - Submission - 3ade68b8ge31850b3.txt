SUBMISSION

Submission
A little bit of that ah ah ah

Take a little right here
Of what I'm about to give
You feel a whole lot better
If you come right in

Take off that shirt
And kick off those shoes
And then baby you're ready
To hit the bottom-end cruise

Now I don't want this holding back
And I can't go for that
So come on
And make that sexy moan

Such innocence like you've never been kissed
I put money on it
You've never done it like this
You turn 'em over once
And on the other side
And then baby you're ready
To go in overdrive

I'll give you my greatest shot
Everything I've got
So come on
And make that sexy moan

Submission
A little bit of that oochie coo
Submission
A little bit of that boop de boop
Submission
A little bit of that ah ah ah
Submission
A little bit of that oochie coo
Submission
A little bit of that boop de boop
Submission
A little bit of that ah ah ah
Submission

I got so much here
That I wanna give
It'd feel a whole lot better
If you come right in

Take off that shirt
And kick off those shoes
And then baby you're ready
To hit the bottom-end cruise

Now I don't want this holding back
And I can't go for that
So come on
And make that sexy moan

Submission
A little bit of that oochie coo
Submission
A little bit of that boop de boop
Submission
A little bit of that ah ah ah
Submission

Chain me down, babe
Do it just a little bit harder
Fill me up and I let you go

Submission
A little bit of that oochie coo
Submission
A little bit of that boop de boop
Submission
A little bit of that ah ah ah
Submission
A little bit of that oochie coo
Submission
A little bit of that boop de boop
Submission
A little bit of that ah ah ah
