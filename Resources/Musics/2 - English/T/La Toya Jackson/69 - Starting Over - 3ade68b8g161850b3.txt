STARTING OVER

Do what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say
Life's too short
Let's have fun

I'm done being serious
And a little mysterious
Tonight I'm gonna have me some fun

Don't judge me
And you'll see
Don't expect dishonesty
Don't forget
No that wasn't me

Fly with me
Through the breeze
Overseas
Ecstasy
I only wanna have fun

All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over

Do what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say
Just live your life, straight or gay
Don't let 'em discourage you
I'm here to encourage you
'Cause they don't matter anyway

There's no (?)
What we do
Menage a trois is up to you
Tonight I'm gonna have me some fun

Fly with me
Through the breeze
Overseas
Ecstasy
I only wanna have fun

All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over

All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over

I don't need no cure
There ain't no looking back
I don't need no cure
No, I don't have regrets
I don't need no cure
I had to face the facts
I don't need no cure
That's why I'm starting over

(Yeah!) All on my own and I'm finally starting over
I'm doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
I'm doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it

All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over

All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
Tonight let's celebrate until I say this party's over

All on my own and I'm finally starting over
I'm doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it
All on my own and I'm finally starting over
I'm doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it
