STAY THE NIGHT

Give love to me as sweet as apple pie
Get next to me, we'll reach the highest high
Why can't you see it could be ecstasy
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Turn on the lights, we'll party way down low
No need to fight, we'll make it nice and slow
Don't leave tonight, we're gonna let it go
Do you know, do you know
Do you know, do you know
Stay the night, I'm a woman, you're a man
Stay the night, we can do it, make it right
Stay the night, stay the night, stay the night
You're off the hook, there's only you and I
Get off the phone and kiss the world goodbye
Let's head for home and make it on our own
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Turn on the lights, we'll party way down low
No need to fight, we'll make it nice and slow
Don't leave tonight, we're gonna let it go
Do you know, do you know
Do you know, do you know
Stay the night, I'm a woman, you're a man
Stay the night, we can do it, make it right
Stay the night, stay the night, stay the night
Play with me, stay the night
I want to make it right, you see
Let me show you now
Play with me, stay the night
I want to make it right, you see
Let me show you now
Stay the night, I'm a woman, you're a man
Stay the night, we can do it, make it right
Stay the night, stay the night, stay the night
Stay the night, stay the night
Play with me, stay the night
I want to make it right, you see
Let me show you now
Play with me, stay the night
I want to make it right, you see
Let me show you now
Stay the night, I'm a woman, you're a man
Stay the night, we can do it, make it right
Stay the night, stay the night, stay the night
Stay the night
