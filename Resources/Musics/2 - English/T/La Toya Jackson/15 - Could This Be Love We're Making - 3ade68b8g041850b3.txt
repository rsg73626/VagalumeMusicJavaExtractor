COULD THIS BE LOVE WE'RE MAKING

You walked into the room and I just had to stare
The moment I saw you standing there
You said you felt it too
Something in me and you
But I don't know if you really care

I never thought it could feel this good
Just to lie next to you
I'm feeling much stronger than I should
Is it just sex to you?

I don't know what it is
You've got me going crazy
Heaven knows this could be love we're making

I want you, you want me
And that's he way it should be
'Cause I feel this could be love we're making

You don't have to pretend
'Cause I'll be back again
'Cause I just love how you make me feel

Sit back, enjoy the ride
I feel so good inside
And my emotions I can't conceal

All of my troubles fade away
When I lie next to you
But I won't desert you if you say
That it's just sex to you

I don't know what it is
You've got me going crazy
Heaven knows this could be love we're making

I want you, you want me
And that's he way it should be
'Cause I feel this could be love we're making

We're here together
Outside there's rain
I feel emotions I can't explain
I don't know, I could be mistaken
I really feel this could be love we're making
What do you think?

Is this love?
Well take a guess
I'd be a fool if I told you yes
What kind of question is that to ask
If I get you nervous by moving too fast
That's just selfish, please just keep calm
That's the way that I am
I don't mean no harm
I tell you right now that you must be mistaken
If you're thinking that this is love we're making

I don't know what it is
You've got me going crazy
Heaven knows this could be love we're making

I want you, you want me
And that's he way it should be
'Cause I feel this could be love we're making

I don't know what it is
You've got me going crazy
Heaven knows this could be love we're making

I want you, you want me
And that's he way it should be
'Cause I feel this could be love we're making
