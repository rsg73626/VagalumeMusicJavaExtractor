HE'S SO GOOD TO ME

You say he's pretending, you say he isn't true
And what you're recommending is to break my heart in two
So put yourself in my shoes and you will understand
My heart is so completely in his hands

So don't give me advice, you don't know what I feel
'Cause when he is beside me, paradise is real
I cannot give a hoopla if it's right or wrong
I follow my emotions all along

He's so good (so good) so good, so good to me
My love is so deep, how could I part company

He makes me feel alive, he fills up my energy
He fills my soul with passion, my longing is so deep
He set my heart on fire and never will let go
He is my one desire all alone

He's so good (so good) so good, so good to me
My love is so deep, how could I part company

My baby
He's so good (so good) so good, so good to me
My love is so deep, how could I part company

He set my heart on fire and never will let go
He is my one desire all along
I don't care about if it's right or wrong
I follow my emotions all along
