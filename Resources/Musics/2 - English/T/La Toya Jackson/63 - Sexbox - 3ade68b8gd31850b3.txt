SEXBOX

I'm not that type of girl
I'm not that type of girl
I'm not that type of girl

What do you think I am
Some kind of one night stand
Big bam, thank you ma'am
Just hit it and quit it
No, baby, you better go somewhere else honey
Not here you won't, uh uh

I met you on the dancefloor
A time I'll never forget
You took me home and opened up my front door
I felt no regrets
Turn me in, turn me out
You make me wanna shout
Oh, it feels so good!

My first time, blew my mind
You know that I ain't lyin'
You were mine and I was yours
Anytime you want me to

Sexbox, sexbox
Is that what I am to you?
Sexbox, sexbox
Come on baby, ooh ooh be doo

Menace Rap
Yo, baby, giving me the runaround
I didn't know if was your first time gettin' down
On the dancefloor, you had my guessin'
Serious first-time impression
I thought sex was all you wanted
It seemed to me you were trying to flaunt it
But maybe I made a mistake
And it was me who was on the take

Last night laying in my bed
Thinking and dreaming of you
Real tight, holding on my head
Thinking what I had to do
All night, felt like a child without a toy
Got nobody to play with me
Hey you! Come on over, boy
Give me what you know that I need

Sexbox, sexbox
Is that what I am to you?
Sexbox, sexbox
Come on baby, ooh ooh be doo

Menace Rap
It all started with a friendly kiss
Moved your lips, I couldn't resist
I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings
By giving you any misdealings
I wasn't feeding you just a line
I never promised to make you mine
Don't confuse sex with love baby
Or it will drive you crazy
You're comin' at me with an attitude
Tellin' me that I'm so rude?
Don Juan is my middle name
I'm never gonna chill out with one dame
So cool out, stop makin' a fuss
I really don't need to hear you cuss
Askin' me for diamond rocks
When all I want's your sexbox

I'm not that type of girl
I'm not that type of girl
I'm not that type of girl

You can't have it
You can't have it
Don't wanna
Don't wanna be your sexbox

Menace Rap
So you say you want respect?
Well, baby, that's what you'll get
I can tell it's no surprise by looking into your eyes
Hypnotize and mesmerize and tantalize and realize
Your body is so fine
I wanna make you mine

A little harder
A little harder

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

Well, you know, there's more to me than by body
Yeah, that's right, I got a mind too
And what about my soul

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

You can't have it

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

That's right
You can't have it
That's right

I'm not that type of girl
I'm not that type of girl
I'm not that type of girl

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

A little harder

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

Like a sex machine
That's right

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox

I don't want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be your sexbox
