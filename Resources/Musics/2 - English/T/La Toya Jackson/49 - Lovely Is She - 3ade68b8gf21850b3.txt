LOVELY IS SHE

Soon as she came
The choir singing took place
Wind in her hair
Her sophisticated air

As she walked in the place
With that look on her face
And she passes by
How she's catch their eye
With a sigh, she walks on by

Lovely is she
Beautiful charming
Lovely is she
Beautiful charming

Entering the room
As she went to take her chair
To smell her perfume
All the men they start to stare

This girl is one of a kind
How she takes her time
To see her face

It would put you in a daze
As they all say

Lovely is she
Beautiful charming
Lovely is she
Beautiful charming

Lovely is she
Beautiful charming
Lovely is she
Beautiful charming

Sipping champagne
How she drover her man insane
Watching in vain
If they only knew her name

Ooh, she's the girl
That could turn the world
And their love in flames
As they watch and adore
Her face, as they all say

Lovely is she
Beautiful charming
Lovely is she
Beautiful charming
