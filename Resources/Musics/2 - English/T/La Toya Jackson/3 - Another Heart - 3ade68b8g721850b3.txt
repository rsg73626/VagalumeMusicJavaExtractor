ANOTHER HEART

He treats me nice
He brings me flowers
We talk for hours at a time

He wears a smile
Like he's not hurtin'
I still see her in his eyes

He's not over her
He's not over her

So I'll just be
Another heart to break the fall
Another name that he can call
When he is alone and needs someone to understand
Someone to hold him tight
With open arms to love him right through it all
Another heart to break the fall

Her memories
It's growing colder
We're getting closer all the time
And I've seen how much he needs me
I know he is leaving her behind

He got over her
He got over her

I'm not another heart
To break the fall
Another name that he can call
When he is alone and needs someone to understand
Someone to hold him tight
With open arms to love him right through it all
Another heart to break the fall

I'm not another heart
To break the fall
Another name he can call
When he is alone and needs someone to understand
Someone to hold him tight
With open arms to love him right through it all
Another heart to break the fall
