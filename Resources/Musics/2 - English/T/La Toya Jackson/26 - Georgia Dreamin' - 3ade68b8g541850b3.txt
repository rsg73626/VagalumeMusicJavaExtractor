GEORGIA DREAMIN'

Heading southbound on a Greyhound
Best friend left me broke as I can be

There's man down in Macon
He's got ideas of making it with me
But its been too long now
Since I've been gone
Finally coming home
Smiling faces is all I can see
He is going to bathe me in those southern charms
Hold me in his loving arms
And right now there is no place I would rather be

Georgia dreamin'
Lately Georgia dreamin' is all I do
Georgia dreamin' of that old oak tree
Where I first made love to you
But I had to see the country
I had to find out on my own
Oh yes I did
Now the only dreams worth dreaming
Are always at home

Up on the highway
I can see that sun-baked Georgia clay
Heaven, no, it won't be long now
Before he'll be back in my life to stay
Here to stay

Well, I said goodbye once too often
I think I might've lost him
I never made the same mistake again
All I wanna do is hold him
Touch his hand and console him
Feel his kiss so Ii won't have to dream again

Georgia dreamin'
Lately Georgia dreamin' is all I do
Georgia dreamin' of that old oak tree
Where I first made love to you
But I had to see the country
I had to find out on my own
Oh and I did
Now the only dreams worth dreaming
Are always at home

The only dreams worth dreaming
Are always at home
