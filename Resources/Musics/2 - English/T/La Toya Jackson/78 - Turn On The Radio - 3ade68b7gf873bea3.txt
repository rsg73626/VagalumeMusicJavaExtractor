TURN ON THE RADIO

Can someone please turn on the radio for me?

It's another cold street
Another silhouette
And a vision
Of My dreams come true
I've been runnin' in the dark
To the shadows of the night
Surrender to my fantasy

No one sees me fall
All my calls are in vain
Empty eyes stare at me
But there's no friend in sight
A perfect thriller
Lured in my bed
With electrical plates
And metallic stakes in my head

Wake me up with the radio
You Know
Before you go, radio on
Please turn on my radio
You know
Before you go, radio on

It's another cold night
And no one holds me tight
In the vision
Of my dreams come true
Feel the new day break
Silent voices all around
I think I've learned
From my past mistakes

Only the rhythm of my pulse
Is beating inside
My body's so weak
And the lights make me blind
A perfect thriller
Lyin' in my bed
With mysterious treats
And a plastic dream in my head

Turn me on to the radio
You know
Before you go, radio on
Please turn on my radio
You know
Before you go, radio on

Wake me up with the radio
You know
Before you go, turn on my radio
Radio, radio, radio

It's a mystic situation
A hollow superstition..o-oh
There's a magic implication
From the love spot information
Turn on, turn on the radio
Radio, radio, radio
