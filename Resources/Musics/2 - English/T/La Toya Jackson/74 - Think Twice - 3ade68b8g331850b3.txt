THINK TWICE

Think; think you better think twice
Better think, think think about it twice
You better think about it twice

I dont know but before you hit the door
You better think about it twice
Oh yeah

Cause when you go
Theres no coming back for more
Cause I not going to be that nice

Saying that Im the only one
(Spending all your time)
With another have fun
(Told me that you care)
Dont you think its time show it

You know I can do the same but Id just rather sacrifice
(Sacrifice for love)

See Im the one; Im a one mans woman
Dont need no two timing man
Oh oh no

Saying that Im the only one
(Spending all your time)
With another have fun
(Typical advice)
