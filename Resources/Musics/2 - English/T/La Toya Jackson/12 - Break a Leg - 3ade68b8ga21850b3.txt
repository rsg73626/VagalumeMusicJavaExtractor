BREAK A LEG

It's hard to hear words without music
Snd even harder to hear music and sit still
But if more people danced there'd be a lot less pain
And more touching and a whole lot more feel

So break a leg
Just break a leg
Let's dance, baby, all night long
And break a leg
Just break a leg
Don't you mess with my mind
And don't you make me beg
Let's get up baby and go break a leg

Get your heart in tune
And get your body in time
'Cause the music is even better than it sounds
Let's dance to the blues
And all these broken dreams
And all of life's little ups and downs

So break a leg
Just break a leg
Let's dance, baby, all night long
And break a leg
Just break a leg
Don't you mess with my mind
And don't you make me beg
Let's get up baby and go break a leg

So break a leg
Just break a leg
Let's dance, baby, all night long
And break a leg
Just break a leg
Don't you mess with my mind
And don't you make me beg
Let's get up baby and go break a leg

So break a leg
Just break a leg
Let's dance, baby, all night long
And break a leg
Just break a leg
Don't you mess with my mind
And don't you make me beg
Let's get up baby and go break a leg
