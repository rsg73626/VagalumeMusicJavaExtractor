HOW DO I TELL THEM

Some girls never learn
Like me, for instance
Everybody's talkin', they all want to know
Why have I been spendin' all this time alone
Do I say he joined the Army
Was lost in Katmandu
I've got to find a story
That's better than the truth
(Chorus)
How do I tell them
I was just a fool for love
How do I tell them
I was just a fool for love
How do I tell them
I was just a fool for love
How do I tell them
Fool for love
They all tried to warn me
But I couldn't see
I was busy laughin'
Now the joke's on me
I said he was the real thing
They told me, "Don't get stung"
What I thought was forever
Was him just havin' fun
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Repeat chorus)
How do I tell them
It's so embarrassing
How do I tell them
I gave everything I had
How do I tell them
They said I'd never change him
How do I tell them
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I said he was the real thing
They told me, "Don't get stung"
What I thought was forever
Was him just havin' fun
