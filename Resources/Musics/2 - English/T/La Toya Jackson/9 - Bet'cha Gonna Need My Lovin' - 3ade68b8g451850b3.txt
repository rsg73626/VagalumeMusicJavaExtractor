BET'CHA GONNA NEED MY LOVIN'

(Betcha gonna need my lovin)
(Betcha gonna need my kissin)

You say feeling low
Well I see the reason why
You keep sitting in the dark
While lovers pass you by
You have a lot friends
The kind money can buy
But when youre home alone
Do you close the door and cry?

(Inside your soul the hurt is plain to see)
From the door shut in your face
To the lies youll need
(Well share a love so true)
Just give me half a chance and you believe
In me

(Betcha gonna need my lovin)
I knew it form the start
You need my caring heart
(Betcha gonna need my huggin)
Good lovin hard to fine
My love, its one of a kind

Stay with me; dont turn your back on love
Give us the chance to find romance youre all Im thinking of
Dont be afraid to open up your heart
You and me together will never be apart
No

(Inside your soul the hurt is plain to see)
From the door shut in your face
To the lies youll need
(Well share a love so true)
Just give me half a chance and you believe
In me
