LOVE SONG

You've been gone too long
I hope you stay one night and come back
'Cause the feeling's strong
I've got to put you on the right track

The love I see in you
Has lit a new light in my life
And the things you say and do
They've got me me workin' day and night

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm going to write, hey
I'm gonna write a love song
Write a love song about you
Yes, I think I'm gonna write
I'm gonna write a (little) love song

You say it's the same old story
About a boy meets a girl
You say you're in heaven glory
May not be within my world

Just give me time, we can work things out
You'll learn what my love is all about
You don't know what you've done to me
I just want you all night long

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm going to write, hey
I'm gonna write a love song
Write a love song about you
Yes, I think I'm gonna write
I'm gonna write a (little) love song

You say that you have been lonely
And you should get another chance
That if you have tried sincerely
Maybe you'll find romance

You and I were meant to be
Two as one living life so free
'Cause you know I can't get enough
I'll be glad that you came back home to me

Love song
