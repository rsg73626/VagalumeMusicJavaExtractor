THOUGHTS TO GROW

How can you accuse the day before daybreak
Every smile you haven't seen might be yours
Severalt times it was suited to bring out luck maybe
And now hours have lost their weight
Till now the laugh has start to fade
As long as you walk as long as you look
You'll see nothing than the reflection of things which aren't
what they should be
And every step behind the mark is a reminder of your destiny
Your on your knees a nation is praying to the gods of faith
Don't realize what they have done by acting
The paradise of merchandise is sold out
Selfdenial/Selfdetermination which you never find on shopping channel
To take and to give means to become reality
