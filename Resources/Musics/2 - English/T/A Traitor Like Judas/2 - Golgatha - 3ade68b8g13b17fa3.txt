GOLGATHA

Your money makes the world go round
Murder
Your lies are paving the way of the killing machine
Abstract multilated greed burns in your eyes
as you turn your back and feel free
The mark of Judas in your heart
You look away and feel free
Hellchild
Speed of a new breed
Spit your poison of damnation in the eyes of innocent
The world in flames
Master of fire
The world in flames
Master of fire
Your words are carved into stone
Written by the slaves of corruption
Spit your poison of damnation in the eyes of innocent
