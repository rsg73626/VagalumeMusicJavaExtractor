NEW SONS OF BABYLON

Forget your fairytales about morality your ethics in disguise your lies
are your power the fear is your sword. Do you believe what you teach
do you live what you preach
Fuck you judas

TV screen generation in your artificial world.
Cross on your grave is a fake cross on your grave is a fake
I think you are a traitor like judas I think you are a traitor like judas

Do you belive what you are theaching
do you believe what you are preaching to this fucking world

Your plastic smile fade slowly away when the servants
rise the new sons of babylon. It's the end of your traditions

It's the end of your traditions.
The intellect will slaughter lambs and you are a Traitor like judas
You want education we will let your schools burn, burn, burn
