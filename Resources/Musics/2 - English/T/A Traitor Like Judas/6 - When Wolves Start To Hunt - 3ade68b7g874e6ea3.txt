WHEN WOLVES START TO HUNT

Another body lay broken on the
Ground so clap your hands and
Stomp your feet.this is just another
Glorious victory for the enemies of

Humanity...can't you...cab't you hear
Conquer the bridge follow my
Orders never surrender never
Retreat.they gave us stones we

Bring em steel...they gave us stones
We bring'em steel.can't you...can't
You feel,can't you hear the sound of
Freedom.hear the call of freedom.

Cab't you hear the call of freedom.
Hear the call for blood.let them
Kiss eternity another body starts
Dancing with the fire...can't you
Hear the sound of freedom.
