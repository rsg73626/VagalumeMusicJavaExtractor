FADING SMILE KISSED THE SUN GOODBYE

This is your lullaby as I sit on your deathbed
and watch the snow fall
Your fading smile kissed the sun goodbye
and it burns from inside
Are you able...I mean...can you see the light
I regret that I couldn't stop this nature
from taking you away from me
As you take you last breath clos the eyes
I know it's time to go from the first day we are gone
slowly dying damned to crawl feet first into hell
But where fear the darkness meets
we will realize that we are all shadows of shattered dream
Reborn in new memories even if the light is gone
I'll take your hand and step with you into eternity
