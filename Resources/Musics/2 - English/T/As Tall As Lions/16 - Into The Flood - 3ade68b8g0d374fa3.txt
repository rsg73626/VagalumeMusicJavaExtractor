INTO THE FLOOD

all this time is ash and sand
it's running thru my hands
so what if i don't feel it
so what if i don't see it
torn apart from limb to limb
and put in place again
so what if i don't feel it
innocence is gone
and you don't taste the same
i know that you don't see it
the steps between us is starting to show
the space between us is starting to grow
i know that you don't see it
all this time is ash and sand
running thru our hands
so what if i don't feel it
