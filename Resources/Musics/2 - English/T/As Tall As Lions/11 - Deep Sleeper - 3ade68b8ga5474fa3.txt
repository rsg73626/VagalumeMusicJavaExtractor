DEEP SLEEPER

In the belly of a dream
I bought a gram of opium seeds
I heard a hundred flowers speak
It's True

And I met two little girl eyes
Her body was a countryside
That led the day into the night
It's true

In the belly of the street
There are idiots walking with their feet
To where the ocean kissed the land
It's true

I met a walrus and a man
They really helped me understand
That life is just a dream
Then who's the fool?

Gaman Dikeru

I'm dreaming on papavarine
Hole fallin'
I'm lookin' glass lookin'
In the garden of live flowers
I'm deep sleepin'
A deep sleeper
