THE CAROUSEL

I've been so in love 
I stutter as my life unfolds 
Don't ask you won't be told. 

You broke the promise 
I'm lying on the floor tonite 
To dream of all those empty memories of singing on that carousel we'd ride together. 

Hey Mother, why do you cry? Tell me what the birds have said about my father. 

Hey Father, what do you know? "Lovers on the carousel won't ride forever." 

I walk to the ocean. I'm looking through kaliedoscopes to see the colors. 
Don't say, You "saw writing on the walls," if you believe that simple words will make a difference. 

Sick sick my heart. I want to die, so that I can stop this crying.
