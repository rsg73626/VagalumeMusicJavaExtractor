I'M KICKING MYSELF

Heard your broken voice on the telephone
Made my heavy heart sink like a stone
And after all this time, I should've known
You'd let me down, right down to the bone.

You know you're right, I'm incomplete
And I could never write down what I mean
And if you told me that the world
Was ending tonight, well that's all right by me.

Hey babe, I feel as though I've failed you
Well I feel as though, you don't want me
I keep kicking myself.

They say that anything can be replaced
Found another girl to pass the days
She is beautiful, she has your face
There is nothing time will not erase.

And hey, babe, I feel as though I've lost you
And I feel as though you don't want me
And I keep kicking myself.

And lately, when I sleep alone
I feel that I ought'a learn, you don't need me
Just stop kidding myself
