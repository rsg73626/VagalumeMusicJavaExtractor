SILHOUETTES/SILHOUETTING

Don’t think you can get out this easy
I feel it too, but I'll never move
It's what you didn’t do that’s making you look so guilty
of hiding the truth the you really feel

I'll remember your smile
coming out as I cling on with eyes
cursed all the sky you were on

some things are better off left unsettled
go close your eyes to try to forget
its so you to walk all the world’s laid footsteps 
hoping that you did nothing at all

I'll remember your smile
coming out as I clinged on with eyes
curse this star we’re on
