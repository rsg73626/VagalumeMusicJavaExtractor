IF I'M NOT OUT BURNING

I'm lighting matches off of 
you and burning bridges all 
for you. 
Their fires leave a 
perfect view of what seemed 
to be your mouth letting 
loose one more regret. 
The two of us never looked so bad. 
I've watched the changes 
through black eyes, it's been 
like a movie for all my life. 
I've watched the changes 
and you don't know the half 
of it. 
God this makes me sick 
to say, but my one last 
regret is that the two of us 
never felt so right.
