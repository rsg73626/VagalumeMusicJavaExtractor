AND THE WICK BURNT BLACK

can foolhardy love affairs, 
be more than just wet thighs? 
because the all that you're giving me 
I don't recognize 

the strength of your beauty's been 
somewhere seeking solitude 
and you're still afraid of me 
it's all in your eyes 

here we are 
my heart's in your hand 
we did this all wrong 
let's do it again 
you're a gun 

this bad taste of leaving 
will rush through my mouth 
the words that I'm sealing 
I'll start with now 

if my words were stone 
I'd kiss them in your mouth 
and though you're the lion 
I'll drag you down 

let's sing tonight 
while holding my hand 
we could be friends 
but I'm better off sleeping alone 

I'm nothing (like an urn) 
I'm filling my body with flesh you have burnt
