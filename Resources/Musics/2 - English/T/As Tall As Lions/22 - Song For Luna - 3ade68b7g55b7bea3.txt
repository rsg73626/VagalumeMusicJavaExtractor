SONG FOR LUNA

Summer,
It's been three years since i last saw
That loneyly smile
Bound to be a thousand more
'till i can find
A face i loved as much as yours
Mi hermosa

Never
Would have thought you'd catch my eye
Across the room
Broken english, a goodbye
That came too soon
Who needs words when you reply
Con su cuerpo?

I've been stuck
On your foreign eyes
They have struck for better boy
We put your lives on our shoulders
But these arms are too weak to hold us

Dreaming
'bout some drunken melody
You sung before
Verses beautiful and strange
I love that song
I am strong beneath the fold
Of all that flies

Haven't found all that i'm looking for
Lost your ghost somewhere in samana
I run my fingers across windows to trace
All the outlines that make up your face
Haven't found all that i'm looking for
Lost your ghost somewhere in samana
Try and try there's no use to pretend,
All i want is to see you again

Sing into the moonlight
Who could ask for more?
