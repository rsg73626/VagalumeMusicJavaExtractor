96 HEARTBEATS

There’s no sign of love
I can see the faces
underneath the smile
everyone’s alone

And they don’t believe you so
no, they won’t believe you, no
we are the only ones
that won't let go

get somebody else to
tell you how you feel inside
let it go, let it go

this seems so surreal
keg of empty promise
constantly I feel
shaking in my bones

And they don’t believe you so
No, they won’t believe you, know
am I the only one
who hurts my soul

Get somebody else to tell you how you feel inside
and you let somebody else drag you down
don’t fake it all, don’t fake it all
You're the leader in the basement
let it go, let it go

I’m a fool at heart
I’m weighted up against
the cruelest of hearts
I’m weighted up against

I sing sweet again
I sing sweet again
I sing sweet again

Don’t feel bad
Do what you want no, no
I want to believe you so
Do what you want no, no
Why should I feel so bad
we’re keeping it no, no...

Get somebody else to tell you how you feel inside
and you let somebody else drag you down
But don’t fake it all, don’t fake it all
You're the leader in the basement
let it go, let it go
