LOVE LOVE LOVE

Have i
Ever told you before
I think you're beautiful when
You're sleeping?
I have faith you watch me in
My slumber, too.
If i'm
All that you're looking for,
Tell me,
Why is there a river streaming
Down your face?
Sometimes makes me wonder
All about your
Love.

After some time
It's something i find true. love's
Not a grave, it won't decay
On you.
Too many days i was afraid
Of love.

What
If nothing is just that and
Suffering's the only thing we're good
At?
Dreaming, picture that
A whole world in a slumber.
But don't get
Too attatched to the living,
Even every single memory's
Fleeting.
That's a fact, being torn
Asunder.
But to my suprise, no reason
Why, one day i woke
Up and realized.

Give it to me,
Love. i'll keep you in my focus
With love and affection.
