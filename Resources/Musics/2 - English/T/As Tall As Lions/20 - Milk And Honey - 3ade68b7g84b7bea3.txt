MILK AND HONEY

I'm sick of waking up alone,
Honey i'm pleading
Let's put away the sticks and stones
Be human beings
I have the sense to be afraid to be a fool

You push me out again
You push me up against a wall
You told me once your body flowed
With milk and honey
But what happened to our boy
Inside your tummy?
I have the sense to be afraid, to be a fool
But i'm on the fence
To make you stay or to be cruel

You perfume covered helpless louse,
Look on the bright side
See, every time you laugh out loud
I'm crying inside
I have the sense to be afraid, to be the fool
Try commonsense. make me believe
Believe in you

I should have known you'd kick me hard
When i'm on the ground
