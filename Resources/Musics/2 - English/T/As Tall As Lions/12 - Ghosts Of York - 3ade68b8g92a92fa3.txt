GHOSTS OF YORK

I know
We're all souls just trying to connect with
Someone, but we're all
Left searching on our own

Tell me that you could hear it
Three taps under the floorboard.
Dont' say i'm losing it,
Maybe you're deaf.
Could have sworn
That i locked
All these windows fairly tight.
Shut the door
Hear a knock.
She starts turning off the lights

And from the corner of my eye
I saw your dressed all in white
I saw you pass right by
But maybe i had too much wine
I hope you come back tonite
You never said goodbye

Tell me that you could see it
A ghost who's skin is porcelain
Don't say i'm losing it
Maybe you're blind
Saw her walk
Through a wall,
Turn her head and look at me
In a york hotel hall
I am falling to my knees

Softly, as your dress flows,
You say that you're alone.
But i know i can't leave you
Lonely and on
Your own
