WHERE DO I STAND?

Dear, i fear that we've gone wrong
You've always hung me from teh gallows
Well i don't feel i'll be forgiven

If you don't see it
You can never walk away
If you don't feel it
It's going ot get harder everyday
But you don't want love
Keeping you awake at night
'till you can sleep

Dear i feel that you've settled
You've always pushed me in the shadow
Well i don't feel you'll be forgiven

When you wake up alone
Do you love me still?
Do you question the choice you made?
Do you wake up at all?
