MAYBE I'M TIRED

If love comes your way
Don't be afraid
Unlock the box you heart's encased
Hope it wont change
And beware of the games
That she'll want to start playing
Oh, lately babe
I stay awake thinking this life gets lonely

Well maybe i'm just scared
Scared to let you go
I want you to know
Right from hello
Your love just keept me wondering
Well maybe i'm just tired
Tired of never knowing

I know i'm not good enough for you

If i can be saved
Show me the way
Help me help myself, baby
Don't be confused
Our love is true
Just tell by the way i'm looking at you
