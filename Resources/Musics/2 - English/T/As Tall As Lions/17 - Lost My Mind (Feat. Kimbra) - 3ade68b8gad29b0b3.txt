LOST MY MIND (FEAT. KIMBRA)

Close to home
Far from me
I thought I lost my goddamn mind
Trying to be all that you want me to be
And now you're gone, gone, gone
You won't look at me

Kodachrome is how I see
All the world's in black and white
Red, blue, and green
The moment's locked up in our machine
And now they're gone, gone, gone
Oh, they're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
From my memory

Wake up in his
We rose a toast to the rest
But nobody cares
If I let it in
Who knows what's staying under my skin
