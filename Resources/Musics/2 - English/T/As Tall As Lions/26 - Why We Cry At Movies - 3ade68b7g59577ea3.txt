WHY WE CRY AT MOVIES

Hey, You've got me baited
with hooks in mouth.
But I don't want to let you know.
You see I fall so slowly
Like leaves in the air.
Its tellin to let you go
I guess theres no way to make love
not break our hearts(x3)
theres no way to break love 
not break our hearts.
and you're feuled on failure
the mistakes we've made, 
regrets we've seen.
i've scarred to deep to be your wound
its strange how it goes when nobody knows
you're not alive(x2)
i guess theres no way to make love
not break our hearts(x2)
theres no way to make love
not break our hearts
i guess theres no way you'll
i guess theres no way you'll
fall in love again
Oh(x2), What could feel, but somewhere you'll feel
better than this, than this,
if only you could see, mmm
