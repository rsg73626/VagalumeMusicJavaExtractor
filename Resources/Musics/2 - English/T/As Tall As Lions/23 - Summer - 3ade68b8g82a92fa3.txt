SUMMER

Summer,
It's been three years since i last saw
That lonely smile
Bound to be a thousand more
'till i can find
A face i loved as much as yours
Mi hermosa

Never
Would have thought you'd catch my eye
Across the room
Broken english, a goodbye
That came too soon
Who needs words when you reply
Con su cuerpo?

[Chorus:]

I've been stuck
(We put your lives on our shoulders)
On your foreign eyes
(But these arms are too weak to hold us)
They have struck..
(We put your lives on our shoulders)
for better boy


Dreaming
'bout some drunken melody
You sung before
Verses beautiful and strange
I love that song
I am strong beneath the fold
Of all that flies

[Chorus:] x2

Haven't found all that i'm looking for
Lost your ghost somewhere in samana
I run my fingers across windows to trace
All the outlines that make up your face
Haven't found all that i'm looking for
Lost your ghost somewhere in samana
Try and try there's no use to pretend,
All i want is to see you again

Sing into the moonlight
Who could ask for more?
