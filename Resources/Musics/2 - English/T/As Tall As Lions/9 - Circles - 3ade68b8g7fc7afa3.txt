CIRCLES

Breathe me in my love
And hold me in tight
Wandering, not lost
Alone in the night

The fear's begun to surface
So breathe me in my love
And hold me in tight

You had me going for a minute there
I thought I heard you coming up the stairs
There comes a time you need to let me know
We'll fight your demons
When they start to show
I would never mind a sudden change
Sometimes it gets us on our better days
You're just a victim of the circumstance

Breathe in
As you spin in circles
So breathe me in my love
In circles

What we take
Hold of
Is up to us now
So try and hold your head
Up above ground

You had
Me going for a minute there
A subtle feeling lingered in the air
There comes a time you need to let me know
We'll fight your demons when they start to show
I would never mind a sudden change
Sometimes it gets us on our better days
You're just a victim of the circumstance

Breathe in as you spin incircles
So breathe me in my love
In circles
