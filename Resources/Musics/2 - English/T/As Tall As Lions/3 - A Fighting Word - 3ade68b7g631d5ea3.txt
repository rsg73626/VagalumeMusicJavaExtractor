A FIGHTING WORD

sunday's is over let me love you 
we'd take our clothes off in my bed 
i would rob your body, with my body 
though you lied to me instead 
you just rolled me over 
and all i'm feeling are your soft lips 
and all i'm breathing is your air 
and how i want to end this cold war 
can i end this cold war? 
why go on if you're still scared of what i'm not scared of 
you just rolled me over 
i'm not leaving until you're sorry 
you're far away 
one floor away 
and i'm not going until it's over 
you're far away 
one floor away 
when i do what you do then you can roll me over
