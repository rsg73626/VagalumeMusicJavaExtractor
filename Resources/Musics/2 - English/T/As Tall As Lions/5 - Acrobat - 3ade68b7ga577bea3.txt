ACROBAT

Tonight,
Pretend you're an acrobat
And you're being thrown
On top of the world

Do you still wish you were beautiful?
Because you will always be beautiful...

Tonight,
Pretend you're a cigarette
And you're being smoked
By a picturesque girl

Do you still wish you were beautiful?
Because you will always be beautiful...

And you will always be beautiful,
You will always be beautiful.
