DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO

Everybody's startin' to pick on you
Just can't let them tell you what to do
You've only got one life so live it cool, huh
In this world of swipe you can't be a fool

Don't let nobody tell you what to do
You gotta be your judge and your jury too (toto, totoro, to)
Don't let nobody tell you what to do
You gotta be your judge and jury too (tororo, roro), alright

Aha

Got to do your thing and let it all hang out
Got to really show them what it's all about
Move on up, don't look around
People always try to put you down, down now

Don't let nobody tell you what to do
You gotta be your judge and your jury too (toto, toro, to)

Don't let nobody tell you what to do, ah
You gotta be your judge and jury too (tororo, roro)

Aha, aha, aha
