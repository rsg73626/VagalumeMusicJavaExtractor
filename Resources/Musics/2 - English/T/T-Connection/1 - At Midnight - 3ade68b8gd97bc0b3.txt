AT MIDNIGHT

(Midnight, midnight
Midnight, midnight
Midnight, midnight
Midnight, midnight)

(Midnight)

Look into my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you see some possibilities?
Try and get away tonight, you can leave with me
It's a golden opportunity

And when the sun goes down my fantasies run wild
When midnight rolls around I really come alive

At midnight (midnight), oh, I really come alive
(Midnight, midnight) oh, my fantasies run wild
(Midnight, midnight) I got so much energy
(Midnight, midnight) yeah, deep inside of me, girl

Come a little closer, girl, look into my mind
You would be surprised at what you find
There's a roaring lion inside of me, waiting for the night
Comes out only when the time is right

And when the sun goes down my fantasies run wild
When midnight goes around I really come alive

At midnight (midnight), oh, I really come alive
(Midnight, midnight) oh, my fantasies run wild
(Midnight, midnight) I got so much energy
(Midnight, midnight) yeah, deep inside of me, girl (midnight), oh!

And when the sun goes down my fantasies run wild
When midnight goes around I really come alive

At midnight (midnight), oh, I really come alive
(Midnight, midnight) oh, my fantasies run wild
(Midnight, midnight) I got so much energy
(Midnight, midnight) I got so much energy

(Midnight, midnight) yeah, deep inside of me, yeah
(Midnight, midnight) yeah, at midnight, midnight
(Midnight, midnight) midnight, oh
(Midnight, midnight) while the world is sleepin', people needin'

(Midnight, midnight) said I love my fantasies run free
(Midnight, midnight) at midnight, midnight!

(Midnight, midnight) I let my fantasies run free, yeah
(Midnight, midnight) talkin' 'bout midnight!
(Midnight, midnight) midnight, come on!
(Midnight, midnight) at midnight, come on

(Midnight, midnight) oh, baby!
(Midnight, midnight) oh, baby, yeah!
(Midnight, midnight) at midnight, midnight!
(Midnight, midnight) midnight!

(Midnight, midnight) wow, ooh
(Midnight, midnight)
