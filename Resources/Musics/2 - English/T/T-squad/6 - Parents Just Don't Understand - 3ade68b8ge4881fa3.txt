PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND 

LISTEN UP NOW EVERYBODY
ALL YOU KIDS ACROSS THE LAND
LISTEN UP NOW EVERYBODY
PARENTS DON’T UNDERSTAND…

YOU KNOW PARENTS ARE THE SAME
NO MATTER TIME NOR PLACE
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT US KIDS
ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES
SO TO YOU, ALL THE KIDS ALL ACROSS THE LAND
THERE'S NO NEED TO ARGUE
PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

I REMEMBER ONE YEAR
MY MOM TOOK ME SCHOOL SHOPPING
IT WAS ME, MY BROTHER, MY MOM, OH, MY POP, AND MY LITTLE SISTER
ALL HOPPED IN THE CAR
WE HEADED DOWNTOWN TO THE GALLERY MALL
MY MOM STARTED BUGGING WITH THE CLOTHES SHE CHOSE
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING AT FIRST
I JUST TURNED UP MY NOSE

SHE SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG? THIS SHIRT COST $20"
WE SAID, "MOM, THIS SHIRT IS PLAID WITH A BUTTERFLY COLLAR!"
THE NEXT HALF HOUR WAS THE SAME OLD THING
MY MOTHER BUYING ME CLOTHES FROM 1983
AND THEN SHE LOST HER MIND AND DID THE ULTIMATE
I ASKED HER FOR ADIDAS AND SHE BOUGHT ME ZIPS!

I SAID, "MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU'RE RUINING MY REP"
SHE SAID, "YOU'RE ONLY SIXTEEN, YOU DON'T HAVE A REP YET"
I (WE) SAID, "MOM, LET'S PUT THESE CLOTHES BACK, PLEASE"
SHE SAID "NO, YOU GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN NOT FOR A FASHION SHOW"

I SAID, "THIS ISN'T FAMILY MATTERS, COME ON MOM, I'M NOT ERKLE
MOM, PLEASE PUT BACK THE HIGH WATER PANTS WITH LIME CIRCLES
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO I CAN LIVE WITH THAT BUT
YOU GOTTA PUT BACK THE DOUBLE-KNIT REVERSIBLE SLACKS"

SHE WASN'T MOVED - EVERYTHING STAYED THE SAME
INEVITABLY THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL CAME
I THOUGHT I COULD GET OVER, I TRIED TO PLAY SICK
BUT MY MOM SAID, "NO, NO WAY, UH-UH, FORGET IT"
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO, I TRIED TO RELAX
I GOT DRESSED UP IN THOSE ANCIENT ARTIFACTS
AND WHEN I WALKED INTO SCHOOL, IT WAS JUST AS I THOUGHT
THE KIDS WERE CRACKING UP LAUGHING AT THE CLOTHES MOM BOUGHT
AND THOSE WHO WEREN'T LAUGHING STILL HAD A BALL
BECAUSE THEY WERE POINTING AND WHISPERING
AS I WALKED DOWN THE HALL

I GOT HOME AND TOLD MY MOM HOW MY DAY WENT
SHE SAID, "IF THEY WERE LAUGHING YOU DON'T NEED THEM,
"CAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOOD FRIENDS"
FOR THE NEXT SIX HOURS I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOM
THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ABOUT 200 MORE TIMES
SO TO YOU ALL THE KIDS ALL ACROSS THE LAND
THERE'S NO NEED TO ARGUE
PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

MOM: I DON’T CARE IF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND ARE A M ING EACH OTHER
KID: IT’S IMING
MOM: GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW
KID: THERE’S NO EXPLAINING GROWN UPS
DAD: HEY I’M WITH IT, I LIKE THAT JUSTIN TIMBERLAND GUY

DAD: HEY YOU WANNA SEE ME DO THE MOON WALK AGAIN
MOM: I LOVED WHEN YOUR FATHER DID THE MOON WALK
KID: WHAT ? SHHHHH!
DAD: WHAT’S THE SHIZZLE MY UH GRIZZLE
KID : IF YOU LOVED ME YOU’D STOP
DAD: GRIZZLY BEAR
KID: THEY JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND
DAD: MOM AND DAD IN EFFECT
