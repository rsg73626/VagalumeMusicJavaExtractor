VERTICAL

(hook)
I won’t ( i won’t) won’t be held down
Be stuck here on the ground. yes sir! it’s the real me (real me)
I have found and i’m risin’ up (risin’ up!) . (x2)

Your feelin’ something’s incomplete, your faith is where a concrete seat, and they refuse to make a move, this can’t be
Your life.
You know that something’s out of step, cause you ain’t found the rhythm yet. break from one, a different drum, this one is
Right.
I believe that i can be both the same thing. watch me spread my wings.

[chorus]
I’m goin’ vertical, a dream gets to fly. it’s like a miracle, a reach through the sky.
If you want it you need it, now you’ve just got to free it.
And it goes vertical,vertical.

Why shouldn’t i have locked the door, that’s what i got my own key for.
I don’t care whos keeping score, i’m not gonna lose. don’t matter what i won’t forget, only what is represents. it’s in my
Head it’s making sense, i’m gonna choose.
To believe that i can be both the same thing. watch me spread my wings.

[chorus]
I’m goin’ vertical, a dream gets to fly. it’s like a miracle, a reach through the sky.
If you want it you need it, now you’ve just got to free it.
And it goes vertical..

[hook]
I won’t ( i won’t) won’t be held down
Be stuck here on the ground. yes sir! it’s the real me (real me)
I have found and i’m risin’ up (risin’ up!).(x2)

[chorus (broken up) ]
Vertical (interlude) a miracle. if you want it,
You need it.free it. vertical. .

[chorus]
I’m goin’ vertical, a dream gets to fly. it’s like a miracle, a reach through the sky.
If you want it you need it, now you’ve just got to free it,
And it goes vertical
Vertical!
