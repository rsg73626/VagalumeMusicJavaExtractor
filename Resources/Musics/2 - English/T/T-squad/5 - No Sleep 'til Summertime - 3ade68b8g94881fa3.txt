NO SLEEP 'TIL SUMMERTIME

SUMMERTIME AND THE LIVIN IS EASY
THE SUMMER’S HERE YEAH YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME
I’LL RIDE THE WAVE TO WHEREVER IT LEADS ME
WHERE THE SUN SHINES BRIGHT AND THE WIND BLOWS BREEZY
NO SLEEP TIL SUMMERTIME

BOYS:
IN THE SUMMERTIME ALL IS RAD 
YOU KNOW JUST WHAT I MEAN
GIRLS LOOK FLY PASSING BY
IT’S A BEAUTIFUL SCENE
TOES IN THE SAND, HAND IN HAND
EVERYTHING UNPLANNED
SAME TIME SAME PLACE 
SOAKING THE SUNRAYS 
DON’T YOU FORGET MY FACE

GIRL:
IN THE SUMMERTIME IT’S ALL GOOD 
YOU KNOW JUST WHAT I MEAN
THE BOYS LOOK FLY, THEY CATCH YOUR EYE
IT’S A BEAUTIFUL SCENE
JUSTIN ON THE RADIO, PARTY ON THE PATIO
READY HERE WE GO
SAME TIME SAME PLACE 
SOAKING THE SUNRAYS 
BIG SMILE ON MY FACE

CHORUS
THERE’LL BE NO SLEEP TIL SUMMERTIME OH YEAH
(AW COME ON COME ON)
WAITING FOR IT ALL THROUGH THE YEAR
(FLIP FLOPPIN HALTER TOP ROCKIN)

BOYS & GIRLS:
SODA POP, OLD SCHOOL HIPHOP
DANCING TILL WE DROP

LYING IN THE SUN
MONKEY IN THE MIDDLE, WHEN WE WERE LITTLE
WE KNEW HOW TO HAVE SOME FUN
SAME TIME SAME PLACE 
SOAKIN THE SUN RAYS
CAN’T LET IT GO TO WASTE

CHORUS REPEAT

BRIDGE:
REASON ONE THAT SUMMER RULES
WE DON’T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL
FROM THE BEACH TO THE POOL
LOOKING HOT AND KEEPING COOL
OPEN TOES T’S AND VANS
WORKING ON THE PERFECT TAN
INSTANT MESSAGE WHAT’S THE PLAN
PARENTS JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND
HOT DOGS BEACH PARTIES
CHECKING OUT THE SUPERHOTTIES
VOLLEYBALL AND CATCHING RAYS
NOW IT’S TIME TO HIT THE WAVES
AT THE MALL WINDOW SHOPPING
DREAMING UP A LOOK THAT’S POPPIN
SUMMERTIME JAMS DROPPIN
SUMMERTIME IS NEVER STOPPING

CHORUS
NAH NAH NAH NAH
