SECOND STAR TO THE RIGHT

Now hold to the dream don't forget to stop 
Keep it real we can make it to the top 
Spread your wings and take it to the stars 
We can do it cuz we know just who we are 
We gotta do dis cuz together we stand 
We on a mission and we got a secret plan 
Spread your wings and kick it to the sky 
Holla to the planets now we're passing them bye 

The second star to the right 
Shines in the night for you 
To tell you that the dreams you plan 
Really can come true 

The second star to the right, 
Shines with a light that's rare. 
And if it's never land you need, 
It's light will lead you there. 

Twinkle, twinkle, little star 
So I'll know (I will know) just where you are (where you are.) 
Gleaming in the skies above (ohhh) 
Lead me to the land I dreamed of: 

And when our journey is through, 
Each time we say good night, (say goodnight) 
We'll thank the little star that shines, 
The second from the right. (second to the right) 

The second star, 
The second star 
The second star to right 
The second star, 
The second star 
The second to right 

Now hold to the dream don't forget to stop 
Keep it real we can make it to the top 
Spread your wings and take it to the stars 
We can do it cuz we know just who we are 
We gotta do dis cuz together we stand 
We on a mission and we got a secret plan 
Spread your wings and kick it to the sky 
Holla to the planets now we're passing them bye
