THE JOURNEY'S JUST BEGUN

THE JOURNEY'S JUST BEGUN 

Boy:
This is all about you and me
This is how it has to be
The dreams that we have dreamed 
The places that we want to see
This is all about keeping on
The light before the dawn
The love that flows through every song
And positivity

Some people say that anything can happen
That you can make it right as long as you believe
But if the rain comes and the clouds get dampened
Just keep on keeping on and know that you will see

There were times we wondered 
Were we gonna go under?
Rainbows or thunder, we didn’t know
Through the tears and the laughter
Whether happy or sadder
The before and the after made us all so close
The journey isn’t done
Just look how far we’ve come

Boy:
This is all about keeping on
The light before the dawn
Let me tell you one to one
The journey’s isn’t done

Verse:
Some people think that they don’t need direction
Some people think that they are better on their own
I know that we have made the right connection
And I can see it in the way that we have shone

There are times we doubted
When we screamed and we shouted
Our vision was clouded it was hard to deal
The terrible weather somehow just made us better
We did it together and we kept it real
The journey isn’t done
But look how far we’ve come

Boy:
This is all about you and me
This is how it has to be
Let me tell you one to one
The journey’s isn’t done

Rap:
No matter if it gets hard
You know you can’t forget
Gotta take that baby step
The best part hasn’t happened yet
Still you got to understand
We can’t get stuck in (the) sand
Together we can make a plan 
Together we gotta do the best we can

Verse3:
Some people think that life is never easy
That you can’t tough it out or make it in the end 
But when the sky is gray and wind gets breezy
You gotta hold on tight and kn ow you’ve got a friend

There were times we wondered 
Were we gonna go under?
Rainbows or thunder, we didn’t know
Through the tears and the laughter
Whether happy or sadder
The before and the after made us all so close
The journey isn’t done
Just look how far we’ve come
