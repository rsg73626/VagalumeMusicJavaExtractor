WHAT'CHA GONNA DO? 

WHATCHU GONNA DO WHEN YOU’RE MOMMA FINDS OUT
YOU LIED? YOU LIED?

I FEEL LIKE I’VE DONE THIS I KNOW YOU HAVE TOO
DELETING REPEATING AND DON’T YOU KNOW IT’S DÉJÀ VU
THE LIES THAT YOU’RE SPINNIN’ ARE EASY TO SEE
YOU’RE BUSTED I TRUSTED BECAUSE YOU LIE SO OBVIOUSLY

AND WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE WHAT’S IN STORE
WHEN THE BOY CRIES WOLF WE JUST IGNORE IT
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE WHAT’S IT GONNA BE
NOBODY TRUSTS YOU CAN’T YOU SEE?

UP AND DOWN AND AROUND WE GO
WHERE IT STOPS I GUESS WE JUST DON’T KNOW SO … 

WHATCHU GONNA DO WHEN YOU’RE MOMMA FINDS OUT
YOU LIED? YOU LIED?

JUST LISTEN YA DISSIN CUZ YOU GOTTA LEARN
NOW ANSWER THE TRUTH AND DON’T BE YESSING
NOW EVERYTHING YOU SAY’S GOT ME SECOND-GUESSING
UP AND DOWN AND AROUND WE GO

WHATCHU GONNA DO WHEN YOU’RE MOMMA FINDS OUT
YOU LIED? YOU LIED?

WHATCHU GONNA DO WHEN YOU’RE MOMMA FINDS OUT
YOU LIED? YOU LIED?

YA PANTS ARE ON FIRE YOU’RE MAKING ME MAD
PERSPIRE YOU LIAR I KNOW I’VE BEEN HAD
BUT YOU GONNA SEE THAT IT DOESN’T PAY
TO TWIST DA TRUTH WITH EVERY WORD YOU SAY

UP AND DOWN AND AROUND WE GO
KARMA’S COMIN TO GET YOU YO
CHORUS

LISTEN UP NOW CUZ WE’RE GONNA BREAK IT DOWN
LET ME HEAR YOU NOW
WE GOT THE POWER TO TURN THIS BEAT AROUND
LET ME HEAR YOU EVERBODY
