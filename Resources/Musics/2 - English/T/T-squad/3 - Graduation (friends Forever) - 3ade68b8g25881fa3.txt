GRADUATION (FRIENDS FOREVER)

GRADUATION (FRIENDS FOREVER) 

AND SO WE TALKED ALL NIGHT ABOUT THE REST OF OUR LIVES
WHERE WE GONNA BE WHEN WE TURN 25
I KEEP THINKING TIMES WILL NEVER CHANGE
KEEP ON THINKING THINGS WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME
BUT WHEN WE LEAVE THIS YEAR WE WON’T BE COMING BACK
NO MORE HANGING OUT CUZ WE’RE ON A DIFFERENT TRACK
AND IF YOU GOT SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO SAY
YOU BETTER SAY IT RIGHT NOW CUZ YOU DON’T HAVE ANOTHER DAY
CUZ WE’RE MOVING ON AND WE CAN’T SLOW DOWN
AND THESE MEMORIES ARE PLAYING LIKE A FILM WITHOUT SOUND
AND I GET SO EXCITED AND WE’D GET SO SCARED
LAUGHING AT OURSELVES THINKING LIFE’S NOT FAIR
AND THIS IS HOW IT FEELS

CHORUS:
AS WE GO ON, WE REMEMBER
ALL THE TIMES WE HAD TOGETHER
AND AS OUR LIVES CHANGE
COME WHATEVER
WE WILL STILL BE FRIENDS FOREVER

SO IF WE GET THE BIG JOBS AND WE MAKE THE BIG MONEY
WHEN WE LOOK BACK NOW, WILL OUR JOKES STILL BE FUNNY
WE WILL STILL REMEMBER EVERYTHING WE LEARNED IN SCHOOL
STILL BE TRYING BREAK EVERY SINGLE RULE
WILL LITTLE BRAINY BOBBY BE THE STOCKBROKER MAN
CAN HEATHER FIND A JOB THAT WON’T INTERFERE WITH HER TAN
I KEEP, KEEP THINKING THAT IT’S NOT GOODBYE
I KEEP ON THINKING IT’S OUR TIME TO FLY


CHORUS:
AS WE GO ON, WE REMEMBER
ALL THE TIMES WE HAD TOGETHER
AND AS OUR LIVES CHANGE
COME WHATEVER
WE WILL STILL BE FRIENDS FOREVER

WILL WE THINK ABOUT TOMORROW LIKE WE THINK ABOUT NOW?
WILL WE SURVIVE IT OUT THERE ?
WILL WE MAKE IT SOMEHOW?
I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD NEVER END
AND SUDDENLY IT’S LIKE WE’RE WOMEN AND MEN
WILL THE PAST BE A SHADOW THAT WILL FOLLOW US’ROUND
WILL THESE MEMORIES FADE WHEN I LEAVE THIS TOWN
I KEEP, KEEP THINK THAT IT’S NOT GOODBYE
I KEEP ON THINKING IT’S OUR TIME TO FLY
