ENCORE'S THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE MEDLEY

There are those, there are those
I suppose, I suppose
Think we're mad, think we're mad
heaven knows, heaven knows, heaven knows

The world has gone, 
Has gone to rack and to ruin

What we think is chique, unique
And quite adorable, so adorable
They think is odd, and sodom, and gomorable
Adorable, deplorable

But the fact is
Everything today is thoroughly modern
Check your personality
Everything today makes yesterday slow
Better face reality

It's not, insanity
Says vanity fair
Infact, it's styliish to raise your skirts and bob your hair
Raise your skirts and bob your hair

Have you seen the way they kiss in the movies
Isn't it delectable
Painting lips and pencil lining your brow
Now is quite respectable

Goodbye, Good goody girl
I'm changing and how

So beat the drums
Cuz' here comes thoroughly
modern millie now

What we think is chique, unique
And quite adorable
They think is odd, and sodom, and gomorable
But the fact is

Everything today is thoroughly modern
Bands are getting jazzier
Everything today is starting to go
Cars are getting snazier

Men say
It's criminal
What women'll do

What they're 
Forgeting is
This is ninetine twenty two
This is ninetine twenty two

Burn the bridge
Bet the store
Baby's comin
Home no more

Not for the life of me

Break the lock
Post my bail
Done my time i'm
Outta jail

Not for the life of me
Not for the life of me

A life that's 
Gotta be more than a one light town
Where the light is always red

Gotta be more 
Than an old ghost town 
Where the ghost
Aint, even dead
Even dead

Burn the bridge
Bet the store
Baby's comin home no more
Not for the life of me

Gotta be more than a one light town
Where the light is always red

Gotta be more than an old ghost town
Where the ghost
Aint, even dead'

Clap your hands
Just because
Where I am aint
Where I was

Not for the life of me
Bohdohdeeoh

Not for the life of
Not for the life of me

Goodbye
Good goody girl
I'm changing and how

So beat the drums
Cuz' here comes thoroughly
Hott of the press
One step ahead
Jazz age
Whoppee Baby 
We're so thoroughly
Modern
Millie
Now!
