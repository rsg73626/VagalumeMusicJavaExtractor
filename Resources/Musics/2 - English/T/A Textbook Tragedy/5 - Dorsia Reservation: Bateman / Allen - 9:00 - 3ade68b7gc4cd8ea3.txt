DORSIA RESERVATION: BATEMAN / ALLEN - 9:00

I'll be there shortly 
Sit tight I won't be long 
It's been a while since I've been home from work 
I've got a confession to make I'm not the man you think I am 
Let me explain 
I have been employed for the past two years by a man who pays for murders to be carried out on people who betray him 
He gives me their name and address I arrive and quickly finish them off without any hesitation or human emotion 
I'm a killer 
But not a liar 
I'm just putting it all out there 
Try to realize I'm a working man 
We do what we do 
We kill who we kill 
Life is short 
You're so sweet 
Please understand 
Now you know you can't tell not one soul 
I need you 
So this is how it ends 
Stay with me I'll spare your life 
It never should have come to this
