CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE GRAMMAR QUEEN

Last word 
Clenched jaw 
She'll be fine 
Trophy scars 
Spell that shit 
She'll do fine 
Come on baby 
Win this for me 
You're the best there ever was 
Hush falls 
Crowds dead 
Oh shit 
What have I done? 
Prescription drugs these days 
I just want to go home 
But I can't because I'm so high that I killed every fucking person I know 
(And now my throat is gushing blood) 
Get me a doctor 
There's no hope for anyone else 
I'm a god-damn honor roll student 
I correctly spelled all the words 
Get me my trophy 
And my crown and thrown 
Before I die or sober up 
I want to be well known 
Is this what you wanted? 
I brought home top prize 
Are you as proud as you look 
Despite the wounds gaping in your fucking chest?
