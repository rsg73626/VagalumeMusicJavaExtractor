DANCE, NILS, DANCE!

Let me introduce myself doc 
Take this sedative hold it off 
My life seems to be wearing out 
I am stuck in the same clothes 
Smoke is rising it makes me sick 
Listen close and you'll hear it scream 
I am gonna get you 
They say we always burn up quickly 
But I 
Will suffocate before 
These flames engulf me 
Are you with me? 
Are you with me? 
I cast the role I do insist you play the part 
Raise the bodies 
They will dance for you 
Raise the bodies 
They will dance for you 
(So let's party) 
Charred skin black bones I'm drunk when in Rome 
Charred skin black bones sunlight take me home
