THE SURGEONS AT DAWN

As we walk farther into this dark chasm 
We begin to see the shadows waver just slightly 
Like the unassuming players in an elabotate scheme 
To dethrone the king and spill the blood of his allies 
And as the water drains slowly into our boots 
We can only assume that there will be a light at the end of this tunnel 
But there is no need to fear because our fate is set in stone 
And the air smells of death now 
But we are comforted by the sound of our own black hearts beating in our chests 
And the familiar itch of our skin 
End my life 
She screamed 
I want to die now 
(Pretend that this never happened I will lift you from this foul soil)
