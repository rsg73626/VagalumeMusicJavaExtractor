STAY CLASSY, SAN DIEGO

Focus on the choir 
They can't see you gasping for assistance 
Sitting in the back row of a hall 
That's free of windows 
Blink twice if you hear me 
This isn't real 
Dreams mark our skin 
I call this fiction 
You had no reason 
I watched you pull three birds out of mid flight 
Snap their necks 
So we'll all retreat in an attempt to save ourselves 
From the massacre of the pirates 
I'm blind now 
But I can feel you brushing up against my side 
With knives in both your hands 
There's a reason for all of this 
But you know I'm forgetful 
Focus on the choir 
They can't see you 
They can't hear you 
Your existance is a question 
You're a question 
There's no answer
