CYNTHIA: A MISTRESS

Cynthia 
Why are you always screaming? 
Tell your lies 
Nobody believes you 
Think this through 
Are you sure you want this? 
Are you sure you want to end on a violent note? 
I know I do 
Just sit still 
I got a girl 
She's out of this world 
Yea she's electric 
With disco curls 
So bring your close friends 
And party down 
We've got a nice place 
Come drink a round 
Sour? Saint? Sour! 
Cynthia 
Come closer 
I've always been a sucker for those vicious eyes 
Now dim the house lights 
And settle in for the show 
The fourth floor looks just like a theatre 
Now we're ready to go 
see the angel with the cut wings 
Lying on the pavement 
Bleeding from the landing 
Choking on her own teeth
