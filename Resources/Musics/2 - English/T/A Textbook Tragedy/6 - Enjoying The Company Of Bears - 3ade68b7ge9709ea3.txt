ENJOYING THE COMPANY OF BEARS

Kill this notion 
Everyone's dying 
We must flee this island quickly 
Look at us wasting precious seconds 
Just push the weak aside They'll bleed out underwater 
Run run run run run 
Before you get your chance to meet the maker 
You'd better give him reason 
To guide you on your way home 
And if you're in your Sundays best he'll let you in his chariot to ride along with Bacchus 
Please God 
They all gasped in time 
Show us a sign 
Bow before me 
Brothers I am 
Here to save you 
Time is fleeting 
For now you are the lucky ones 
Pretend that this never happened I will lift you from this foul soil
