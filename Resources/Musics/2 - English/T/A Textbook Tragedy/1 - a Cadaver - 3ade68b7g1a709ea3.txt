A CADAVER

So leave the keys in the igniton 
And turn the headlights off 
Wait till' her body hits the ocean 
From here all hope is lost 
Blood on my hands (dead on the floor) 
Finish it up (dead on the floor) 
Make this shit quick (dead on the floor) 
Anger's a bitch (dead on the floor) 
Die a martyr 
Death on my mind (watching her sink) 
Fuck with my head (watching her sink) 
This is a lie (watching her sink) 
Romance, that bitch! (watching her sink) 
Die a martyr 
We all stand 
We all fall 
We all die 
We all crawl 
With no luck I will fall 
With no luck I will crawl on my fucking knees 
To the end, to the end 
Countdown 
Game time 
One shot 
So spin the bottle round and round 
Drink up kids this one's on the house 
And as the sirens near the street 
My splattered blood will spell defeat
