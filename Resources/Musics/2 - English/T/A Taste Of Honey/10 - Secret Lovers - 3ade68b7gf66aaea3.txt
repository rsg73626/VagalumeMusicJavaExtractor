SECRET LOVERS

I hate to think about us all meeting up together,
as soon as I looked at you it would show on my face.
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other.
They can never no, oh no, we can't leave a trace.

Secret Lovers that's what we are, we shouldn't be together
but we can't let it go, oh no, cause we love each other so.

Sittin at home I do nothing all day
but think about you and hope that your ok.
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously, alone...by the phone.

How could something so wrong be so right.
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives just ain't easy at all
but we gotta hang on and after fall.

Secret lovers that's what we are
trying so hard to hide the way we feel
cause we both belong to someone else
but we can't let it go, cause what we feel is oh so real
so real....so real...

You and me, are we fair
is this cruel, or do we care.
can they tell what's in our minds
maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin love we notice the time
we both get nervous cause it's way after nine.
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
we gotta be careful, so that no one will know.

Secret lovers, that's what we are,
trying so hard to hide the way we feel,
cause we both belong to someone else,
but we can't let it go
cause what we feel is oh so real
so real...so real....so real....so real!
