BOOGIE OOGIE OOGIE

If you're thinkin' you're too cool to boogie
Boy oh boy have I got news for you
Everybody here tonight was boogin'
Let me tell you
You are no exception to the rule

Git on up on the floor
Cuz we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
till you just can't boogie no more
Boogie no more
You can't boogie no more (boogie)
Boogie no more
Listen to the music...

There's no time to waste, let's get this show on the road
Listen to the music and let your body float
The sooner we begin the longer we've got the groove
Listen to the music and let your body move

Now git on up on the floor
Cuz we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
till you just can't boogie no more
Boogie no more
You can't boogie no more (boogie)
Boogie no more
Listen to my bass here
[bass break]

Get down, boogie oogie oogie
Get down, boogie oogie oogie
Get down, boogie oogie oogie
Get down

(fade)
