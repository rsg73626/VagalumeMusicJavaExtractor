SAYONARA

When we met I was a lady in distress
I needed someone to hold on to
For a while, infatuated by a smile
Finally showed both ways was mistaken for love

I always found a bit of security in someone else
But now I know I've got to find it for myself
So we

Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than it is
Sayonara
I got to go my own way, hey
Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than is
Sayonara, sayonara
Whoo!

I regret what happen but it's for the best
Forever after is this moment
If it seems as though I used you in your dreams
It was not my plan to take advantage of you

I've always found a bit of security in someone else
But now I know I've got to find it for myself
So we

Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than it is
Sayonara
I got to go my own way, hey
Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than is
Sayonara, sayonara
Whoo!

Bye bye, baby!

When we met I was in distressed
For a while you made me smile
I regret, it happened for the best
If it seems like I used your dreams

I've always found a bit of security in someone else
But now I know I've got to find it for myself
So we

Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than it is
Sayonara
I got to go my own way, hey
Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than is
Sayonara, sayonara

Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than it is
Sayonara
I got to go my own way, hey
Sayonara
Don'tcha make it any harder than is
Sayonara

Sayonara
Sayonara
Go my own way
Sayonara

Sayonara
Sayonara
Go my own way
Sayonara
Go my own way
