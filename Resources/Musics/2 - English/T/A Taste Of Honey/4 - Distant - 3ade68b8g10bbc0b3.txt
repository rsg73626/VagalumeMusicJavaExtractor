DISTANT

Sitting around thinking about you
Trying to convince myself
that you're thinking about me too
But I know better and it's the truth that I feel
'Cause if you really love me, honey
I know that you'd be here

Distant love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away
Distant love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away

I cannot believe what you're doing to me
You've got me down on my bended knees
You make me cum like a heavenly ray
Each and every time boy that you call my name

Distant, distant is your love
Don't take your love so far away
You're distant, oh baby
Distant, distant is your love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away

Just a passion word from you
can make my whole day worthwhile
Can't you see sugar baby
you're the reason for my smile
Like the snow capped mountains that are in you
Whowee honey baby, distant are you

Distant, distant is your love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away
You're distant, oh baby
Distant, distant is your love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away

Distant, distant is your love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away
I'm talking about your love
Distant, distant is your love
You're love is distant
Don't take your love so far away

Hey baby, your love is distant
