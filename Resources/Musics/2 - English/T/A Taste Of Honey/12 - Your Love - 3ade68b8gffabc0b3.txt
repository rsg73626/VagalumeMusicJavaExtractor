YOUR LOVE

For your love I would give you my world
For your love I'd be your little baby girl
Your love thrills me through and through
You're just too good to be true

And for your love fills my day with pure delight
Your love is my sugar spice and everything
As your love, it's a blessing in disguise
Your love is all the reasons why

The scent of jasmine fills the air
And you're all the reasons why
The scent of jasmine fills the air
And flowers are blooming

And for your love I would give you my world
For your love I'd be your little baby girl
Your love thrills me through and through
You're just too good to be true

And your love brings out the beauty all around
Your love turns my frown upside down
Your love it's a blessing in disguise
Oh love, you're all the reasons why

The scent of jasmine fills the air
And you're all the reasons why
The scent of jasmine fills the air, your love
You're all the reasons why
The scent of jasmine fills the air
And flowers are blooming
Because of you flowers are blooming

It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Ooh baby
