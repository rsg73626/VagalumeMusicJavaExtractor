DO IT GOOD

Come on and get down while you can
Close your eyes and feel the vibe of the music
Don't hold back, let it go
Don't be afraid 'cause it's okay to let it flow

Hey, do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good

Come on and do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good (yeah)

Hmm hmm hmm
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Move your body to the disco beat

The stage is set now, the light's on you
You can do it, get into it, feel it through and through
Don't be shy, get it on
And put your hand on your hips, let your back bone slip, now get it on

Hey, do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good

Come on and do it
Do it, do it good
Get up and do it
Do it, do it good

Everybody do it
Do it, do it good
Come on and do it
Do it, do it good

Come on and do it
Do it, do it good
Do it
Do it, do it good

Hmm hmm hmm
Oh, clap your hands, stomp your feet
Move your body to the freaky beat
