SUKIYAKI

It’s all because of you
I’m feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so
How much you’ll never know
You’ve gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true
That once turned all my gray skies blue
But you’ve disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
I’m wishin’ you were here with me

Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you’re gone I don’t know what to do

If only you were here
You’d wash away my tears
The sun would shine
And once again you’d be mine all mine
But in reality
You and I will never be
‘Cause you took your love away from me hooooh

If only you were here
You’d wash away my tears
The sun would shine
Once again you’d be mine all mine
But in reality
You and I will never be
‘Cause you took your love away from me, hooooh, baby
You took your love away from me
