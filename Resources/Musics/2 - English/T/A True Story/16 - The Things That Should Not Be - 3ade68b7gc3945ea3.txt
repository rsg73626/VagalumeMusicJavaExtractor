THE THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE

To live is to learn
and I will live through this
I will be your worst
I will smile again
I feel this as much as you do and it hurts to know
that you're out there not by my side
Like a ghost I walk through this town for all to see through me
Paint my windows blackso I don't have to see tomorrow
Alone and torn
Slit my wrists and drown my world in vanity
