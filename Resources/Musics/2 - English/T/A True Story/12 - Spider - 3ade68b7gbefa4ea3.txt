SPIDER

If you really wanted my heart
you would have no patience in waiting to hear my voice
The clock says 12 but I dont know its wrong
cause you said you'd be gone last night
Black cat that crosses your path
Ladder over your head
The mirror you break in vain
The Spider
The Spider
I thought that love
even broke its promises sometimes
but now I know that love doesn't even try
Your the cause to all of my bad luck...
