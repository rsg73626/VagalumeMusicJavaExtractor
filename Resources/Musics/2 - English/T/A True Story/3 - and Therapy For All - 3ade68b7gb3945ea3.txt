AND THERAPY FOR ALL

It'll be ok, As long as no one finds out
I want to feel you, Watch you go down with me
You think I'm down and out but I'm still standing
A life inspired by a broken heart is never the same
as a life inspired by a thoughtless heart with no one to blame
And now I know the truth about you
and now I know my way around you
You think I missed my days without you
I fucking wish I never found you
Believe me when I say....
Never Again
