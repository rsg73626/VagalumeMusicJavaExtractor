WHITE SUIT

Advance toward anything worth the control, 
This is my big break this is my big mistake, 
No matter how hard I try I cant find another way. 

(chorus) 
Contemplating with a head that held high by you, 
Letting go of all I had of all I know, 
Pushing forward to reach no end, 
I've tried to assume the part,
But just broke down as I lie next to her, lie next to her. 

I'm whole now, 
But unravel me and watch how I fall to pieces,
Read every layer rewrite every line tell me how it is and how it should be, 
I cant believe you took that kissing thing seriously what was I thinking, 
I should've laid you down, made you scream, took your trust, broke your heart. 

(chorus)
My intent to make it that far will only end up, 
Under these miserable circumstances.
