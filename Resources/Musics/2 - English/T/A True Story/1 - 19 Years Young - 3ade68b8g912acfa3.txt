19 YEARS YOUNG

You can't tell me you care about what goes on in my head
I know that you say what you believe is not what I see
Father you are wrong
I'll get to you
Once I'm gone, I'm gone tonight
Oh why must it be like this
I never thought it would
Who's left to embrace me
this soul as dark as night
one by one you'll rest in pieces
eyes to the sky
