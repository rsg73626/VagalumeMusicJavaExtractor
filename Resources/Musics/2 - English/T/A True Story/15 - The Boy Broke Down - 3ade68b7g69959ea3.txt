THE BOY BROKE DOWN

It seems were stuck in the same boat, 
So throw yourself overboard and drown with the rest of the fish's in the sea, 
It seems were stuck in the same boat, 
So throw yourself overboard and don't anticipate a life vest from me, 
Its every man for himself. 

So take this car and drive me out of my mind, 
Or off a cliff, 
Whatever you think will make me forget this, 
Quick here's a bridge on second thought I'll take the risk, 
You always did. 

Before we hit the bottom i just want you to know that this is the first time that i went on a limb, 
I know its not yours and you must feel different but you always did, you always did. 
And so the story goes that boy had broke.
