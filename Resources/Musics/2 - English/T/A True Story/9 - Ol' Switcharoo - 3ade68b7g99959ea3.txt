OL' SWITCHAROO

is something the matter your gripping that wheel quite tight,
she replies no nothing at all, 
a poor choice of words for an actress of your caliber. 

(chorus) 
Anyone can see through the windows on your face, 
that your brain is storming on the inside, 
running out of excuses as presumed, 
lets face the facts your a horribly bad liar. 

Fashion snobs, 
you think it would be different, 
then later on pick up the scent of counterfeit personalities,
no technicalities, 
only dull conversation cant keep us awake, 
you cant keep us awake.
