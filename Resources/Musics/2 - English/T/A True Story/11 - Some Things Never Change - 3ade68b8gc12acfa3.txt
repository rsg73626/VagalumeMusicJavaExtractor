SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE

Faking my death was never this fun
A blade is my saving grace
empty phone calls left me wanting more
My fear of acceptance kept me from you
But your voice it calmed my nerves now look at you
Look at what you've become
I can't take these steps again
The path to the closet
Lock me inside away from you
Will I ever see your face again
Never want to see your face again
