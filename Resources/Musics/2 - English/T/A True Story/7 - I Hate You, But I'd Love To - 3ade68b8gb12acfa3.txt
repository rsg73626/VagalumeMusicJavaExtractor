I HATE YOU, BUT I'D LOVE TO

Cant trust you anyway (whispers)
Cant trust you anyway (repeat)
The lines on your face stay
A smile never goes away
Your permanent mask of everything I want to see
But when it gets old it starts to look fake
And you left with no one to show
My secret means alot to where you are and where I want you
A secret so well kept that not even you know
What's it like to be blind to what could change your life Forever
I'll never go back
How does it feel when I look away
How does it feel when I know better
When did "I Love You" stop meaning everything
and when did "Goodbye", Start meaning anything
Love is blind, it taints your eyes
Such a beautiful sight not to see your face
but to hear your voice, it's torture had by choice
So don't catch me if I fall
to you feet again
