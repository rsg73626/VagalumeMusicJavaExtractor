FOR HER

I set out tonight
Set out to find you
Set out tonight
Set out to find the crime in your eyes

For you are mine
And i am yours
I am your hero
I am your angel

I set out tonight
Im right behind you
Ill be your guide
You have troubles ill find you

Whereever you are
Just say my name..
So take my hand and
Walk with me

Take my hand and
Talk with me forever
You are mine forever
You are mine forever

You are mine...forever
