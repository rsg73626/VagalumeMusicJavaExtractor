WISH TODAY AWAY

Heartbreak last forever and never fails to win
unless the one who left you here can experience that same sin
remember when you can never trust anyone but her
And now she's just a stranger who walks by
So find your faith and pray to your god that you don't make that wrong turn
Keep your hand in your packets and your thoughts in your mind
Keep up the fight
Wish today away
Until the night comes
Cause now it's her turn
I see your face but your shadow tells a different story
Evil has never looked so good in a smile like hers
One kiss I fall to the fall
As you look in awe
this is how the body reacts to poison
This is how the body reacts to poison lips like hers
