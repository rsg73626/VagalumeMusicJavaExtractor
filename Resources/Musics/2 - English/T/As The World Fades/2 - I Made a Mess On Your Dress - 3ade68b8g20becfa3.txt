I MADE A MESS ON YOUR DRESS

Hang on, this wheel might keep turning on and on
Hold on, my friend, it is not quite yet the end
Under this weight, my knees fail me
Close to the ground, I choose to stand

With this song we'll both get carried away
From this crowd, from this life
And if we believe it for tonight
It will last, forever

Darling, theses curves of yours should be illegal
Grasp my hand, bite your lips
(don't speak a single word)
Come on, are you alive?

Hang on, this wheel might keep turning on and on
Hold on, my friend, it is not quite yet the end

With this song we'll both get carried away
From this crowd, from this life
And if we believe it for tonight
It will last, forever

If we believe it's alright, then it's right
