CANISHORYUKEN

We will burn down your fears
We'll prevail over all your tears
If at first you don't succeed
Trying trying is what you need

You're facing your worst nightmare
In the spot light you're right in my cross-hair
Raise your guard!

We won't let you win
Just wait 'til the fight begins

Dance like you've never danced before
Press A, press B, combo your enemy

We will burn down your fears
We'll prevail over all your tears
If at first you don't succeed
Trying trying is what you need

You're facing your worst nightmare
In the spot light you're right in my cross-hair
Raise your guard!

My blood is boiling to a point even metal melt
