WHEN 1 + 2 = 5

There's no questions to ask yourself, yourself.
So leave everything else behind, behind.
Dress yourself to kill tonight, we're going out. x2
I know youre capable, so here's youre chance to show me.
Uhum .. allow me to..
introduce ourselves.
YO! It's A to the F
Gonna rock this town if you know what i mean.
GET DOWN! To the rhytm of the sound
If you're not from around
here's where the party's found;
There's no questions to ask yourself, yourself.
So leave everything else behind, behind.
Dress yourself to kill tonight, we're going out. x2
I know youre capable, so here's youre chance to show me.
ONE MORE TIME
Tomorrow, and the day after.
And so on.
