THE COOL SONG WITH A COOL INTRO

You're not forgotten, i'm by your side.
You won't be dancing alone tonight.
But this is another fail attempt,
trying to fix something
that should have never been.

You know that,
I'm never coming, im never coming back again.
Don't be shy it's not forever,
we'll just play it by ear.

This will be your last chance to say;
I'm yours, so you better scream it
for the times you won't be able to say it.
But this is another fail attempt,
trying to fix something
that should have never been.

You know that,
I'm never coming, im never coming back again
Don't be shy it's not forever,
we'll just play it by ear.

Don't stand still
time is short
take the lead
and make it yours

MOVE YOUR HIPS!

But this is another fail attempt,
trying to fix something
that should have never been.
You know that.
