CAN'T I LIVE?

Verse 1
Why can't yall leave me alone, 
man seem like everybody be judging me, 
talking behind my back, faking the smiles then hugging me,
 pointing fingers hating jealous of my success praying 
for my downfall, can't handle me being blessed, naw, 
you'd rather see me at the bottom of the totem poll, 
scraping for dollars, on the edge bout to lose control, 
back on the corner still living in tha projects, 
still struggling down and out wit no prophets, 
still driving through the hood in a bucket, 
I'm bout bringing my people over like I'm Harriett Tubman, 
Been through the fire like Kanye West, beat the odds 
now I'm on shuffles and ipods, see most of yall 
could never reach stature, cuz half of you gangsta rappers 
is gangsta actors, and backstabbers 
yall got the game backwards, 
but Bone and Darkchild make hits like linebackers. 

Hook
Can I live, If you wanna be in my shoes then get in, 
you can talk the talk, but aint lived the life I live, 
so can I live, that's the question, can Iâ€¦(2x) 

Verse 2
I shed blood sweat and tears, been on this grind for years, 
I'm at the top of the charts, no respect from peers, I, 
could be the franchise still I'm chastised, spreading ya lies,
 need recognize there's two sides, 
my whole life been the underdog, 
against the odds back still against the wall, 
fighting to represent in the ring for God, consciously making
records for a different cause, This crab game keep pulling me
down, but like Ron Artest been known to rebound, 
and like Roy Jones I'm pound for pound spitting 
a different kind of message over platinum sounds, 
can I, get some love and a little respect, can I, 
rock ya world without giving ya sex, can I, 
live in peace man I paid my dues, 
you'll never know where I been until ya walked in my shoes. 

Verse 3
I'm in it for the long hall, committed to the end like John Paul,
 I'm trying to make a change, throw stones if I'm wrong, 
if you can do it better, then by all means, shoot for the stars,
 but stop crushing all of my life's dreams, 
and let me fulfill my destiny and purpose, 
quite trying to make me feel no good and worthless, 
this life is all a playa got to give, so back up 
and give me room to breath can I live.
