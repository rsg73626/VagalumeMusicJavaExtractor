DIPPIN

This is what we call gospel, alpha, mega, funky, boogie, disco, music
Made for you to cruise with, in ya Jeep, Cadillac or tha Benz
Down the strip with ya girl and your friends, just floatin', west coastin'
Hittin' switches in the ragtop boastin', just rollin' on hundred spokes
Ridin' with your ken folks, bumpin' this jam and getting high off the holy ghost smoke
One puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4 puff, 5 I'm feeling real high, leanin' to the side
With the homie Mista Grimm, in tha O.G. gangsta ride
Candy apple with the custom interior, inferia, when it be comin' to rippin' these microphones
Mi familia, is the dopest, no hokus pokus, tha locest vocalist and most ferocious
Rapper is bogus, when I spit, they hopeless

Chorus
We just dippin', in the Lincoln, with the hommmies and the OG's trippin'
Off me rims and the chromed out engine, hydrolics switches and the pioneer system
We just dippin, hittin switches, in the 6-4, rollin' deep in the trenches
Sttin' in chromed out 22 inches, bumpin that west coast sound to the fullest!

Dip, dip, bounce, bounce, front, front, back, back
Right Dayton spokes in the air as I hit that, C-O-R-N-E-R-T-B-O-N-E-&-M-I-S-T-A-G-R-I-double M
Rapiando, cantando, in the 6-4 brincando, pitando, at the homies
Cuz me and Grimm got flava like asada and cilantro, tocando oldoes
As we ride slow, y corriendo, from the po-po, somos los mejores brother
Oh you didn't know, from West Covina to fogtown Frisco, "O"riginal
In the classic blastin' war, hardcore with the suicide doors, L-dang
Riviera, Cutlass, whatever you're in, just keep bumpin' this
