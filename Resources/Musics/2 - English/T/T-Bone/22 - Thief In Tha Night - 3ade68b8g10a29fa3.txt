THIEF IN THA NIGHT

Not good enough
Is the thought that
I thought that I could see
But I was really spiritually blind
Going to church on Sunday
Then Monday smoking on a spliff and still be thinking I could uplift
The name of Christ with my hands waved up in the air
Livin a double life and swearin the lord was someone accord
With all the things that I chose to do
But serving two gods homie be like bein a blood and you be sportin blue
You say it aint true homie don
Read it yourself
Matthew chapter 7; 21 through 23
It happened to me a pastor
Thinking I could live a lukewarm life
And carry a knife in my left hand
And in my right carry a bible
Shout revival
Then shake it twice for my survival
But little did I know that it would all come to a end
Walking home from school on a Friday with a unsafe friend
I seen my dads car wrecked down the street
So I ran to see if he was alive but no one was in side
I couldn
What was going on?
So I ran to the house to see if I could get the info from my mom
The door was wide open so I ran frantically down the hall
Shoutin and screamin
But no one seemed to hear my call
Was I dreaming?
Or could it really be
The rapture happened and the lord took everyone except for me
I dropped to my knees and prayed but couldn
The way I could before when he was knocking at my hearts door
So here I am alone in a world that
And if I wanna buy some clothes or eat they say that I gotta take the mark
Now it
Take it or starve
I quickly take my pick
I choose to rob and steal cuz ill never take the 666
I jump in a stolen car
Get on the freeway heading east
Cuz they
To all my homeboys and homeboys I say you better get right
Cuz when Christ comes back it
To all my homeboys and homeboys I say you better get right
Cuz when Christ comes back it
Its three months later in an abandoned building I live
Constantly ducking and dodging cuz I
I
Cuz I know Jesus aint comin back for a second pass
I blast just to stay alive
I
Cuz like ice did to me
It
If I would
I wouldn
But I thought the life I lived in god
To go to church on Sunday and keep my bible from collecting dust
What
I
I guess they found my hiding place
Cuz all I see is Uzi
They say renounce your god or die
So I reply
The lord is my savior as the tears run down my eyes
My time has finally come
I guess I
To my fathers paradise
A place where sinners will never know
They walk me up the platform
Its execution time
Now on the heavenly stages
The only place I rhyme
They lay me down
Its only seconds till I
Please god have mercy
Somebody catch my head
