BRIDGE OF SPIES

So long I've waited for you to come to me

anticipated what I would say.
And no one could know how it feels to be
in your embrace again
so tender.
Yes
there were times I could not hold on

Each day that came a little more hope was gone.
I'd look into my heart to see what I had done

And now I can't believe
the day is finally come!

I am walking over the bridge of spies today

Freedom is only one more step away
you only have to hold me.

Take me to you!
Now the things we wanted
they're so far away it seems

Your love is a distant thing that I kept deep inside of me.
Now if I could show you where I lived in my fantasy

On the continent of dreams you'd be with me.

I don't know if I could go through it all again

For what's the point if you are never free to say.
This is what I believe
this is a part of me

No hero
no regrets
but only meant to be.

I am walking over the bridge of spies today
. . .
I am walking over the bridge of spies today
. . .

Hold me
hold me! Hold me
hold me!
