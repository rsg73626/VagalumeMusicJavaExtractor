DO YOU WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN

It was the hottest day of August
All of of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock River
I was next in line to be baptised at the innocent age of ten 
And I’ll never forget, I remember it yet
The taste of that clear, pure] water

Chorus:

And I said Yeah, just lead me on’.
“Take my hand, can you feel that feelin’?”
And I said, “Yes just lead me on” 

It was the hottest day of summer 
And our final high school dance was just about over
I was old enough for the taste of love when boys turn into men
And I’ll never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure 
water
But the preacher’s words I barely heard, as sweet Bonnie Lou gave in
She said,” Do you...

Chorus:

It was a lonely night in August
She was sittin’ at the end of the bar when I saw her
And with a little wine and an little time she would be a prize to win
Now I’ll never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure 
water
But that preacher’s words could not be heard, when she whispered, “ Come 
on in”
She said, “Do you...

Chorus:
