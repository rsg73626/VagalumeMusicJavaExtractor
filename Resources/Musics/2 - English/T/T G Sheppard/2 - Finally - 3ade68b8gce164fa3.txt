FINALLY

I wish my mind wouldn't argue with my heart, it splits the 
day apart, into time well spent and time just thrown away, 
I wish my heart would please make up my mind, I'm wasting so 
much time, gotta catch a glimpse of how it's gonna be. 

When finally, I look inside your eyes and see, 
reflections of your self in me, the way you always said it 
would be, when finally, I'm loving you like you love me, it 
happened oh so easily, I looked at you and it came to me, 
finally. 

This Ferris wheel just keeps on spinning round, playing mind 
games with the ground, can we stop this time, or must we go 
again, I see you standing waiting just outside, come and 
get me off this ride, wanna lose myself in being here with 
you. 

When finally, I look inside your eyes and see, 
reflections of your self in me, the way you always 
said it would be, when finally, I'm loving you like you 
love me, it happened oh so easily, I looked at you and it 
came to me, finally
