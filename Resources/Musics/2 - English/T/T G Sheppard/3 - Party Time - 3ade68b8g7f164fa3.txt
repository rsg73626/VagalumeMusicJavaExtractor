PARTY TIME

(chorus 1) 
ohh ohh its party time 
Its Time to get you off my mind 
forget the life i left behind 
and all those dreams that wont come true 
ohh ohh its party time 
its time for laugh and pass the wine 
its early and im feelin fine, Ill soon be over you 
Darlin ever since the day 
yes its time to go our seperate ways 
ive been searchin for a way to be 
for doing you so wrong 
now its time to call the heart 
you know it wasnt all my fault 
you cheated too but you were never cought 
your friends lied all along 
( chorus2 ) 
ohh ohh its party time 
its time to get you off my mind 
its early and i'm feeling fine 
ill soon be over you 
it shouldnt take us very long 
another sip or two and you'll be gone 
another chorus of she done you wrong 
and ill be over you 

" Solo "
