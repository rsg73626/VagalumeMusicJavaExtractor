WITH REGARDS

Lets end the tending to every wound.
The sinking ways of hope.
So we can find a way out.
The sinking ways of truth.
I'm done seeking for love.
I haven't felt anything in so long.
I'm taking every one of you with us.
You'll never leave unscarred.
You'll spend the rest of our days here.
Wasting hours past.
Catching a glimpse of our dreams.
So wake us up from suffering.
I'm done thinking I'm done with you.
Silhouettes of blinding light.
Drown out their screams.
Murderous beauty.
Welcomes us with broken arms.
We'll spend tonight alone.
We'll spend the rest of our days here.
Sew these secrets into tiny knots to help you.
Execute your perfect plan.
Of finding solaces.
Silhouettes of blinding light.
Drown out their screams.
Murderous beauty.
Welcomes us with broken arms.
Sew these secrets into tiny knots to help you.
Execute your perfect plan.
Of finding solaces.
