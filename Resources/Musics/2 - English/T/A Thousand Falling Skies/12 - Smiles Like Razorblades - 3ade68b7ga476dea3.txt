SMILES LIKE RAZORBLADES

Kiss the stars.
Cause this will be the last time.
I ever open myself to anyone.
I ever open myself to anyone.
Who ever know that love could taste like razorblades.
Who ever knew that love could taste like razorblades.
Shapeless faces are stealing your heart.
Right from under me.
I could have given you so much more then hopeless then loneliness.
Kiss the stars.
Cause this will be the last time.
I ever open myself to anyone.
I ever open myself to anyone.
This is the end.
Let's raise our glasses.
And say goodbye.
No more warm fairytales.
No more tear soaked letters.
No more memories.
No more I love you's.
The trickle down effect makes you want to scream out.
And she's running circles in your head.
On re-run, rewind your dead to her now.
I wish it had been so easy to tell you.
How much I cherished every moment.
And I would walk a thousand miles.
To show you how much I cherished every moment we were so wrapped up in.
In a moment.
We'll never get it back.
This is the end.
