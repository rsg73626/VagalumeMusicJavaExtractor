NEVERENDER

With empty hearts we dance tonight.
So the fires won't die.
But we'll tip toe on broken glass.
To see if we still bleed because bleeding would mean we're still alive.
How can you say.
These words meant nothing.
How can you say.
I never loved you.
Love is a four letter word.
I'd rather live without.
And this noose is so tight.
I'm barely holding on.
And these wrists will mark my silence.
And these tears will rinse them clean.
And these wrists will mark my silence.
And these tears will rinse them clean.
And I can't remember the last time the sunlight shined so bright.
I'm thinking of all the things I'd say to you if I ever saw you again.
With empty hearts we dance tonight.
So the fires won't die.
But all along we'll tip toe on glass.
To see if we still bleed.
'Cause bleeding would mean we're still alive.
There is nothing left here.
How can you say.
These words meant nothing.
How can you say.
I never loved you.
This was so beautiful.
This was so beautiful to me.
