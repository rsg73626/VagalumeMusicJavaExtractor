A DESIRE NAME DESPAIR

Kiss this goodbye.
And forgive me for starring but this barrel looks so comforting.
Your feelings change with every passing breath.
And for your sake I hope that somebody finds beauty in your sickness.
There's only one way we can go.
The sun leads the way and we'll follow.
Rest my head on your shoulders so I can remember your embrace.
And as I fall asleep you fade to dust.
Ambers line your once precious lips.
No one in here ever comes out alive.
And for your sake I hope somebody finds beauty in your sickness.
Fade away you will, this I hope of you.
There's only on way we can go.
The sun leads the way and we'll...
