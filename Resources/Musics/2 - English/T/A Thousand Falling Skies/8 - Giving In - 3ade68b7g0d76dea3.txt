GIVING IN

I've got a shovel with your name on it.
And a burial plot to bury my thoughts.
Each day the days get so much bitter.
This is no place for the weak hearted.
Drown your sorrows somewhere else.
Cause you can't call me home anymore.
There's love smeared all over my hands.
For everything you've done to me.
I'll cast you out.
And may you rest in peace.
For what you've earned.
I'll hold my head up high.
Drown your sorrows somewhere else.
Cause you can't call me home anymore.
Despairs calling again.
Calling me into her arms.
This time I'm not picking up.
Not for her not for anyone.
And this was all for you.
It's everything you've ever wanted.
It's how you wanted it.
This is how we'll end it.
Drown your sorrows somewhere else.
Cause you can't call me home anymore.
There's love smeared all over my hands.
