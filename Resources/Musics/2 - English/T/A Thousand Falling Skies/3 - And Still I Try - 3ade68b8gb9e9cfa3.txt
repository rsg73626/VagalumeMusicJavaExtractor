AND STILL I TRY

Nothing more then a cowards lie
Face first denying the truth
Let it be know that i [x2]

Fall face first into your heart
Tears that i have shed
Every breath taken away
Every breath stolen

Nothing could give me more pleasure
Then to see you fall [x2]

Nothing more then a cowards lie
Face first denying the truth
Let it be know that i [x2]

Fall face first into your heart
Tears that i have shed
Every breath taken away
Every breath stolen

[chorus]
Rise, rise your head up
To, to the sky
In, in the past you've been judging me
Soon, and soon you'll die [x2]

I fall, 1,000 times 1,000 times

[chorus]

You've only taken everything i ever worked for. [x2]

[chorus]

Dying inside of you [x6]
