ALMOST HEAVEN (INTRO)

I packed my bags and caught the next train to this mountain side
Where i could watch the sun set with tears in my eyes
I can sit here for days letting the cancer fill my lungs
Letting the tears wash away the pain that i always seem to mask behind a
Smile

Where i could watch the sun set with tears in my eyes [x4]

Yesterday seemed so important to me
And today i lost myself within myself
How could i get lost in what was mine
Rivers run there course,i guess
And sometimes i just run
But today i never stopped
I never stopped running from you
