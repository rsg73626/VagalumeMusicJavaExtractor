EMBRACING EMPTINESS

And her eye's caught the tears
of a 1000 memories
And each one fell in silence
Slowly tearing each fiber
As her heart bleeds
Her knees grew calloused
And she passes each day with a smile [x2]

And now her heart bleeds the coldest blood
In her lifetime [x2]
The coldest blood

Her day's turned to years
Years to memories
Of when everyone laughted at her
And she cries her self to sleep

And now her heart bleeds the coldest blood
In her lifetime [x2]
The coldest blood

Her day's turned to years
Years to memories
Of when everyone laughted at her
And she cries her self to sleep

IN HER EYE'S

Your faces melt away
And she can be happy in this world
In this world

And her eye's caught the tears
Of a 1000 memories
And each one fell in silence
Slowly tearing each fiber
As her heart bleeds
Her knees grew calloused
And she passes each day with a smile [x2]

Your faces melt away
And she can be happy in this world
In this world
