TRANSPARENT HEART SYNDROME

I can't open my mouth to say the words.
I want to say to you.
Instead I'll just close my eyes.
And wish you well on your way.
Out of my arms.
Out of my arms.
Today we part our hearts.
And say goodbye to yesterday.
As if our lips never touched.
As if our hearts never gave into this love.
Your face staring back at me in the distance.
With a grin so wide I cannot bare it.
Your face staring back at me in the distance.
With a grin so wide I cannot bare it.
As if our lips never touched.
As if our hearts never gave into this love.
Your face staring back at me in the distance.
With a grin so wide I cannot bare it.
Your face staring back at me in the distance.
With a grin so wide I cannot bare it.
This is where the fairytales end.
And nightmares begin.
A never-ending fairytale.
Why don't you run away.
I can see the angels have come to take you away.
It's a part of me that dies with you.
I can't hold my breath forever.
As if our lips never touched.
As if our hearts never gave into this love.
Your face staring back at me in the distance.
With a grin so wide I cannot bare it.
Your face staring back at me in the distance.
With a grin so wide I cannot bare it.
