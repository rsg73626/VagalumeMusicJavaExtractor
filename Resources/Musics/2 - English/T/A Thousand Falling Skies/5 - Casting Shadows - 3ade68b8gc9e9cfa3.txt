CASTING SHADOWS

For every ounce of blood I shed
I poured my heart out
On Paper Stenciled Lies [x2]

Shower me with blankets of love
And turn your face and walk away
Leave me with shadows off in the distence [x2]

You will never be part of my life [x2]

FOREVER TEARS FALL [x2]

You'll never be part of me
And i'll never be part of you

I'd pay a lifetime to be by your side [x2]

FOREVER TEARS FALL [X2]

I'd pay a lifetime to be by your side [x2]
