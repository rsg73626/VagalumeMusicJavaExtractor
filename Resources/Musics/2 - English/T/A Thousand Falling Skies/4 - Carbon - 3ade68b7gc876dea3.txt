CARBON

Seems as the world has swallowed us whole.
No such thing as being young at heart.
There's no heart left here anyways.
Nothing to sooth the pain of everyday.
Of everyday.
This is what it's come to.
A bitter suffering.
An agonizing death.
Remembering.
What we once were.
And what we've become.
Finally reality has sunk in.
I swear to you that this is the worst feeling.
Remember me.
This is how I used to be.
But because of you.
That part of me is gone.
That part of me is gone.
I swear to you
That this is the worst feeling.
I'll watch your every move and make sure
I'm just one step behind.
You'll never leave my eyesight again.
Seems as the world has swallowed.
No such thing as being young at heart.
There's no heart left here anyways.
This is what it's come to.
A bitter suffering.
An agonizing death remembering what we once were.
And what we have become.
Finally reality has sunken in.
Remember me.
This is how I used to be.
Maybe in time we'll miss what we had, maybe things won't seem so tragic.
