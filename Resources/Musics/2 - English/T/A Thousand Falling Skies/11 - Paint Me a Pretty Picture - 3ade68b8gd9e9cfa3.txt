PAINT ME A PRETTY PICTURE

I wish these times would never end
today so many hearts will be broken
when happiness and sadness pull at every heart string
pull at every heart string
no one knows where there going
and what tomorrow has in store
i wish we could all hold hands
and come out the other side
i wish we could all hold hands

i can only hope that the memories will never fade
in anyone's mind
even when we only have glossy covered pictures
reminding us of yesterday
yesterday [x4]

if only i had a picture
of today from our hearts
for the cover of the scrap book in my mind [x2]

please paint me a picture of today before
tomorrow takes it away
takes it away

i can only hope that the memories never fade
in anyone's mind [x2]
even when we only have glossy covered pictures [x2]
reminding us of yesterday
yesterday [x4]
