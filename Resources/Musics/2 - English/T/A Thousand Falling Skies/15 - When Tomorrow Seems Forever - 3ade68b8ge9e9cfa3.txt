WHEN TOMORROW SEEMS FOREVER

Today my life
Fell into pieces
Everything i wanted was washed away
I looked today in the eyes
And fell to my knees [x2]

Grey skies above
Each drop drowned my pain
And i cried out to you [x2]
But you where no longer there [x2]
Watching over me [x3]

Today my life
Fell into pieces
Everything i wanted was washed away
I looked today in the eyes
And fell to my knees [x2]

Grey skies above
Each drop drowned my pain
And i cried out to you [x2]
But you where no longer there [x2]
Watching over me

I caused you to run from my me
I caused you to run from my arms
Now all i can do
Is remember
Before things went wrong

When my heart first skipped a beat
And i saw you in my life
Forever [x6]
When i wake up tomorrow
I'll spend another day without you
And so on and so forth
Everyday will seem forever
