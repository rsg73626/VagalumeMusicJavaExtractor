HER DIVINE TRAGEDY

What a beautiful blood soaked canvas.
You've meticulously created.
Full of your chaos and devastation.
Lets start the fires that will burn us all.
I hope your tears flow like oceans.
I hope the sun scorches your eyes.
Cause maybe then you'll realize.
Just who I was or who I could have been for you.
Cause then, maybe then you'll realize.
Just who I was or who I could have been for you.
Just remember one thing.
You're the one that made me this bitter.
And it will take more than hello.
To clear the blood.
She barely moves anymore.
She barely looks at me.
She barely moves anymore.
She barely looks at me.
I hope your tears flow like oceans.
I hope the sun scorches your eyes.
Cause maybe then you'll realize.
Just who I was or who I could have been for you.
Cause then, maybe you'll realize.
Just who I was or who I could have been for you.
She barely moves anymore.
She barely speaks to me.
Sometimes I think I'm better off without you.
I'm sorry I can't save us now.
I'm sorry I can't save you now.
