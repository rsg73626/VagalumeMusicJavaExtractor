NUCLEAR CAROUSEL

The truth,
Will come out,
Fucking hear me,
Hear me screaming,
We know all the fucking lies that you have force fed to us,
Telling us it is safe when the danger,
Drifts ever closer!
If we knew what was being created,
We would have never conformed

I am the maker of catastrophe
And I control sensations that you are feeling,
Theres no compensating,
We are all disgraceful human beings,
Theres no returning,
Neglecting all resources at ours and others disposal
So much that this worlds dying,
But ill tell you it fucking burns bitch!

We all are the fucking kids on a nuclear carousel nuclear carousel
We are all just kids!

Oh perhaps if we knew, if we knew there names,
Things would not be the same,
Hear me out hear me out, why wont you hear me out.
Its over now, and we see, that we, are just

Kids on a nuclear carousel nuclear carousel
We all are the fucking kids on a nuclear carousel nuclear carousel
Kids on a nuclear carousel nuclear carousel
We all are just fucking kids on a nuclear carousel nuclear carousel.
