FORCED ENTRY

I met this slut at this fucking party
She took a trip to the outside with me
She wanted to offer me the invitation

I said to her it not your decision
The bitch left me at the front door
She said, I, couldn't, come back
I kicked the door off the hinges
And before she could scream
I broke her fucking neck
I watched her choking her face drained of blood
Her eyes slowly drifting to the back of her head
Her friends are to busy getting fucked to hear her screams
So I drag her upstairs and spread the disease

Its pointless trying to escape
Your spending the night with me
No one even knows that your missing
A portrait of death you will be

No remorse for what I am doing
She deserves it for what she has done
Destroying lives no one survives
Betraying her loved ones

The end of your life it draws closer,
My victim forever to be
Destroying lives you will not survive
A sequenced disaster

This is the last time she hear my voice
This is the last time she'll breath
Swallowing blood as she speaks
Let her sleep

I watch her as she's sleeping
I wait for her to die
She holds on for longer than expected
As I stare deep into her eyes

I watch her take her last breath
I say "you shouldn't have fucked around with a crazy cunt like me"
I fucking hope it was worth it
Because for me it wasnt fucking worth it.

I'll keep a piece too remember you by
As a fucking trophy
Of what I've achieved

Your corpse tangled and worn
Displayed for all too see
Look what you did to me.
