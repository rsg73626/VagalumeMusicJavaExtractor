OMNI UNIVERSAL ANNIHILATION

We are the inter dimensional,
Plague of earth
We hold the only key to humanities,
Survival!
Noooooooooooooooo
There is no changing paths
Noooooooooooooooo
There is no turning back

This is the chance we took
This is what we're stuck here with
This is the route we chose, now we must follow it.

You give me no reason to breathe.

As I stand on the edge of this planet I've been led too,
I feel that its my only option is to trust what I have become.

The earth it catches me as I fall and takes me to a distant dimension
Where things aren't the same, im now in control instead of being contained

I am a solar being in control of everything
In control of everyone, anything, that has ever been.

I am a human being in control of anything
In control of everything. everyone, thats ever been.

Kill your family
Execute your friends
Slaughter your children
Save yourself

I am extra terrestrial being of colossal stature
A white flag can be shown, but too me it doesn't matter
Theres no way you could have calculated this disaster

You cant rebuild your cities
You cant bring back your friends
You cant revive children
You cant save yourself.
