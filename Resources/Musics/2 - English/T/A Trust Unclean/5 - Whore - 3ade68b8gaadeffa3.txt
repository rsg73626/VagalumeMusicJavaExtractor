WHORE

The urge takes over me again
As I take to the streets too choose you
My specifications are too complex for you to comprehend
I must keep my movements swift
And my conscience clean

I have my orders of the scum I must eradicate
Passed down from a higher power
The ones they want shall now decay
For the way of the life they have chosen
Now no one is safe

Alluding everyone
As they fight to find me
My actions here will be remembered through history

As the night falls and shadows aid me
These cobbled streets become my hunting grounds
My vicious tools and clinical methods
Shall soon be world renowned

And when the morning comes
And the daylight bathes my victims
The screams of those who find them
All signs of a job well done

You can investigate
But you will never find me
My actions are protected

They will watch you die

The way I stalk my prey
Is internally unnerving

And the repercussions
Shall not fall on my shoulders
This is there dirty work
I am a tool of there regime

You shall remember me
But never know me
My name in history
For all eternity.
