FRAGMENTATION

We wait in deadly silence
For the sky to suck your soul up
Because of what you've done
This is the consequence

For you shall feel its fury
Violent and unrelenting
We followed in your name
Too the point of total extinction

This life is a novel and im burning the words
We'll burn the fucking inventory down
Every page is stricken to ash
Until theres nothing left
Untill there's nothing left

They're dragging you,

Down

These commands given to live by
Have been created by the narrowest minds
They want you to abide
If your to survive after you die.

There is no meaning
Just a cause and effect to have control over you

No control over this motion
I warn you whats to come
Spat back into confusion
Reality is fractured
Just a fool to believe your living free
I have much to show you
The lies that believers preach are
So far from the truth

Why would you fucking believe any thing that the good book says

When the master race has already decided our eradication
Theres a good chance that the human race will eventually meet extinction
But I can promise you that is not gods decision

Life in silence

Nothing is heard till you realise were one
Life in silence
Nothing is heard till you realise your free

I bet you fucking like it don't you bitch
I know you love it when you defile his name
You fucking love it

Wait till the hourglass has emptied itself
Do you think the sins will, add up and send me to hell?
You've created a false idol instead of freeing yourself
It is all a mindfuck to keep you held down.

Life in silence
Nothing is heard till you realise were one
Life in silence
Nothing is heard till you realise your free.
