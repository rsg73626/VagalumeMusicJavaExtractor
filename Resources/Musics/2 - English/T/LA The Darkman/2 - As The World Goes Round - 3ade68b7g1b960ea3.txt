AS THE WORLD GOES ROUND

Intro: Raekwon the Chef, [La the Darkman]

[what up La the Dark, the Chef
true scaped it right, scaped it right
scaped it right like white burnin in hell
[flip it up like a hell on doe]

[word, word life
 La the Dark, dig up to my man cuffed]

Verse one: Raekwon the Chef, [La the Darkman]

Yo, yo, yo
ay yo La, wats up son?
ay yo you read the papers
two columbian niggas hit these phony niggas 
and every routine Chevy you call green
had crazy hook up in that peice by old mean
[the kids mad floor and where you had to go down
 killers be comin' for your neck when you're wearing a crown
 for five and eight cane kids ready to spray
 the cats got nine lives from around my way
 Timb boots and over Nore, two text by the door
 so when the Popo come I can take 'em to war]
same subject, text and royalty checks
plus market in the drugs he pull mad respect
I gotta get mine, blast mad nines on a regular
fakin' predator or player I mean this faker
[who the rap mayor its me i'll be the sprayer
 the docs in the realm you contemplate your prayers
 medior right eclipse takin' in the nine-fifth
 all you gapin' MC's like pancakes you get flipt
 I got a thirty shot cliff had the grip and the hip
 a mad half warrior young tale from the cript, kid!

Chorus:

As the world goes round yo it's the same as they sayin'
[Same junkies on the corners shootin' shit in their vein]
Wats the deal black man must rise to the top
[Representin' Darkman with this real hip hop]

Interlude:

And you don't stop
[and you don't stop]
yeah!
[and you can't]
and you can't stop
[word up! word drop that style]

Verse Two: La the Darkman

You only live once execute your dreams
a third real triple beam wait out my skeam
for the cream my soul cracks never cure relax
now bared with Wu-Tang shit and lyrical facks
young black back bastard from the concrete street
and never leave an houn without strappin' my hip
keep peace and Don P word life tiryque
I saw the million dollar show cause i'm that dog P
for a dog, for a spark ready to rip you apart
I was born with a gold shield over my heart
so don't start none, it won't be none
I'm dominatin' the screen my reign just begun
I got more raw cut with the kids doin' biz
you can't dig up my physical like a pyramid
i'm wicked dunn star made La now ride
switch to walk space fly like the starship Enterprise
