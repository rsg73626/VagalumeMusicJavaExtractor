LET'S FIND A WAY

Said I'm fine as I backed up on my porch
My blood ran cold as I went right through that door
It don't seem right but out minds have been made up
I guess you'll never know what life will bring
'Cause I've been back in the house for one last time
I find myself staring right into your eyes
As I stood there by you it reminds me back in time
We're so far that we got lost in time
We went back through the years
Met each other and love each other
We went back to when we started to let go
If we traveled the road on forever and make it better
If we came back in time we'll find a way
Let's find a way
Let's find a way
Let's find a way
