BLINDED BY THE DARKNESS

The laws of God and the laws of man

The laws of man
They don't carry the same weight as the laws of God
Or the laws of nature
In the nomenclature

Do we want to inject the concept of sin
Into the Constitution?
Is this really necessary?
Does this not make you somewhat wary?
Shouldn't sin be left to the laws of God
And to the laws of nature?
Can we trust this to the legislature?

And shall we trust sin to the wisdom
Of the criminal justice system
Which can't handle the criminals we have now
Why create a whole new class of them?

Isn't crime dealt with by the laws of man?
Isn't sin dealt with by the laws of God?

If sin were dealt with by the laws of man
Everybody would be in jail for life
In solitary confinement
With no one to go his bail
Or would have gotten death
Maybe I should save my breath
But this lunacy is bound to fail

But there would be no one to get the food
Or run the machines
Mercy on us, dude

You shine your darkness on me
I am blinded by the darkness

In seven days God created evolution
When shall I expect retribution
From the counter revolution?
