THERE WOULD BE HELL TO PAY

[Chorus:]
When all the ladies heard that he was dead
Some wore orange dresses
And some wore red

When all the ladies heard that he had died
He could hear them wailing
All the way on the other side

Police officer
Walked onto the plan
Don't come any closer
Said Curtis to the man

Curtis said to Delia as she turned to walk away
You so very beautiful but you gonna die someday

Judge he said to Curtis
What's this noise about
Curtis said these evil men
Are trying to put me out

[Chorus]
When all the ladies heard that he was dead
Some wore orange dresses
And some wore red

He unhooked his revolver and pulled on his gloves
Just before he folded King Queen Jack Ten Nine of clubs

He saw Delia leaning over by the door
Stood at the table and he pulled his forty four

Delia started crying fell on her knees to pray
Delia begged for mercy but there would be hell to pay

[Chorus]
When all the ladies heard that he was dead
Some wore orange dresses
And some wore red

When all the ladies heard that he had died
He could hear them wailing
All the way on the other side

Curtis said Your Honor
What might be my fine?
The judge said Poor Boy
You get ninety nine
Other existence identity light
Mojo come to my house then back into the night

Delia was a gambling girl she would scream and shout
She placed a rose at Mojo√ïs tomb then blew the candle out

[Chorus]
When all the ladies heard that he was dead
Some wore orange dresses
And some wore red

When all the ladies heard that he had died
He could hear them wailing
All the way on the other side
