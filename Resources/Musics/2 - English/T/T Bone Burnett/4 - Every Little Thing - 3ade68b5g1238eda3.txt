EVERY LITTLE THING

For every little thing I did to hurt you
For every little way I made you cry
There's another line etched in my face
Another trace of sorrow in my eyes
For every careless word you spoke against me
For every time I staggered through your lies
There's another tear stain in your face
Another trace of anger in your eyes
Measuring the angle of the pain
Taking all the pleasure that remains
Shadows that follow you
Into this solitude
For every little thing I did to hurt you
For every little way I made you cry
There's another line etched in my face
Another trace of sorrow in my eyes
Swallowing the bitter and the vain
Seeing madness following in train
Shadows that threaten when
Dancing like skeletons
For every careless word you spoke against me
For every time I staggered through your lies
There's another tear stain in your face
Another trace of anger in your eyes
