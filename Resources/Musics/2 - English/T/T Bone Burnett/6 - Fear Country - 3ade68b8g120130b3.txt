FEAR COUNTRY

The cat's out of the bag
And it ain't going back
Your plan has hit a snag
It has fallen through the crack

I gotta tell on you
I gotta tell on you

This is fear country
This is fear country
This is fear country

Five years of mercy
And two days of grace
It only took a minute
To fall on your face

I gotta tell on you
I gotta tell on you

This is fear country
This is fear country
This is a fear country

Cowboy with no cattle
Warrior with no war
They don't make imposters
Like John Wayne anymore

This is fear country
This is fear country
This is fear country

Nobody knows what's gonna happen
Nobody knows what's going on
Nobody knows what's coming down
But it's coming down
And it happens in a moment
It happens in a moment

Do this for me or risk eternal agony
This is fear country
This is fear country
And if you don't believe me, I can prove it
This is fear country

This is fear country
And if you don't believe me, I can prove it
This is fear country
