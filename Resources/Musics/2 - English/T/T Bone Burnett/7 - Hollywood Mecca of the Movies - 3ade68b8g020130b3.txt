HOLLYWOOD MECCA OF THE MOVIES

Who are you and why are you speaking aloud?
In this joint there are no cameramen allowed
He is a personality not a person
Crime Being Crime Wave The Scanner
What A Town What A Great Town

We didn't build this place to last forever
Sodium Penathol Pseudologica Fantastica
Honesty is the most subversive of all disguises
I said goodbye a long time ago
You must not have heard me

Measurement and signature
How to throw your voice
Dead Pan Alley
Extreme Consciousness
Power Violence
Social Engineering
Someone stole my identity
And I feel sorry for him

It's a mortal cinch
No resilience
We didn't build this place to last forever
What A Town What A Great Town

Hollywood Mecca of the Movies
