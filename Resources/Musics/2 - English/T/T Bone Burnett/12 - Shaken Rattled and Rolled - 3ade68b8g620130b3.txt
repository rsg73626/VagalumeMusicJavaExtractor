SHAKEN RATTLED AND ROLLED

I can feel it all slipping away from me
So I'll just let it go
And fall through whatever is awaiting me

[Chorus:]
I got shaken last evening
And I get rattled sometimes
And I got rolled in the dim light
Of an hour I can't leave behind

These hard times come down like an avalanche
And I'm lost and detached
Along with all who never had a chance

[Chorus]
I got shaken last evening
And I get rattled sometimes
And I got rolled in the dim light
Of an hour I can't leave behind
