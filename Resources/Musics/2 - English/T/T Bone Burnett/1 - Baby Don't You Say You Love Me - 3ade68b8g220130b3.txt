BABY DON'T YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME

Baby don't you say you want me
Baby don't you say you need me
Baby don't you say you love me for a day
And then you leave me
Baby don't you say you want me
Baby don't you say you need me
Baby don't you say you love me for always
And then deceive me

Every day you haunt me
First you hex me then you taunt me
Then you leave me in this twisted misery
I mean nothing to you but for now I'm seeing through you
Someone else will save you but it isn't me

Baby don't you say you want me
Baby don't you say you need me
Baby don't you say you love me for a day
And then you leave me

Baby don't you say you want me
Baby don't you say you need me
Baby don't you say you love me for always
And then deceive me

Every night you hurt me
First you vex me then subvert me
Then you leave me in this twisted misery
I no longer fear you I can barely even hear you
Someone else will save you but it isn't me

Baby don't you say you love me
