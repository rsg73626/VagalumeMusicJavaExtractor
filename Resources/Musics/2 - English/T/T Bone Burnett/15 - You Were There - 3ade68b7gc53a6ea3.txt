YOU WERE THERE

I can be here while you there, 
Even tho, you dont care, 
I can be a thousand miles away, 
But you still dont care, 
And dont you even dare, 
Disagree cuz, 

*chorus* 
When im here, you are there and you barely bare to, 
understand what im going thru and, 
Even tho your here with me, i can still here you callin my name always. 

Yu can try to understand why im really here but you really undersatnd this...CUZ YOU REALLY CANT WHY IM AM HERE YOU JUST ASSUME!! AND YOU DONT REALLY SEE B4 EYES TODAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
