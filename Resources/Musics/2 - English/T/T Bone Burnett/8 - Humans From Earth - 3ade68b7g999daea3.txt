HUMANS FROM EARTH

Humans From Earth
T-bone Burnett
(Until The End Of The World)

We come from a blue planet light-years away 
Where everything multiplies at an amazing rate 
We're out here in the universe buying real estate 
Hope we haven't gotten here too late 

chorus: 
We're humans from earth 
We're humans from earth 
You have nothing at all to fear 
I think we're gonna like it here 

We're looking for a planet with atmosphere 
Where the air is fresh and the water clear 
With lots of sun like you have here 
Three or four hundred days a year 

chorus 

Bought Manhatten for a string of beads 
Brought along some gadgets for you to see 
Heres a crazy little thing we call TV 
Do you have electricity? 

chorus 

I know we may seem pretty strange to you 
But we got know-how and a golden rule 
We're here to see manifest destiny through 
Ain't nothing we can't get used to 

We're humans from earth 
We're humans from earth
