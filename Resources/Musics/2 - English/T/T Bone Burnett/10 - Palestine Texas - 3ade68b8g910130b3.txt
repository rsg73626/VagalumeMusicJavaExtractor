PALESTINE TEXAS

Frank who was swank robbed a bank with a tank for a prank
Sam who was glam ran a scam from Siam to Viet Nam
Dean who was clean had a scene with the queen for a magazine
Joe wasn't slow but didn't know how to blow all the dough from the show

Peter in a two-seater for a heater had a thirty millimeter
Shecky worked blue for he knew it was true he would not get his due
Ann knew the plan as she ran from a fan with a man from the Klan
Phyllis would thrill us then grill us then kill us with bacillus

Presidents come and presidents go
They rise like smoke they fall like snow
Do you believe the things you say
Your lofty thoughts are filled with hay
What is this faith that you profess
That led to this colossal mess
When you awaken from this coma
You'll find you were in Oklahoma
When you crawl out of this self delusion
You're going to need a soul transfusion

This version of the world will not be here long
It is already gone It is already gone
This version of the world will not be here long
It is already gone It is already gone
