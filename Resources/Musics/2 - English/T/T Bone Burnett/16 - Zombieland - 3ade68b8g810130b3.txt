ZOMBIELAND

Accentuate the positive
Destroy all the negatives
Before the black mass media
Get a hold of them

Boy's been sniffing that frog powder
Drinking that genius juice
Shooting that monkey blood

We're gonna stomp in Zombieland
Devil beat in Zombieland
We're gonna stomp that devil beat
Down in Zombieland

Machines always do just what you tell them to do
As long as you do what they say
Machines gonna stomp
To that devil beat in Zombieland

Look at that boy can't see nothing
Can't hear nothing
Just put him over there
All the tides in Zombieland
Are to oblivion

Sniffing that frog powder
Blowing that Egyptian bone
Settling like a fog

Speaking hieroglyphics
With his pistol and his pills
Phantom conjured to a dark mojo
You want to know but you don't know
You want to know but you don't know
