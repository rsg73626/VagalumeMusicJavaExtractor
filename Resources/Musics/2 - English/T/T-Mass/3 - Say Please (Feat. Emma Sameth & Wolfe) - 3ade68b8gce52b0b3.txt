SAY PLEASE (FEAT. EMMA SAMETH & WOLFE)

Do you like it when I take it real slow?
Slow it down
Speed it up
Now, now

Like it with the lights down low
Moon bright
Sippin' on skin
Liquor thicker
Pour it in my cup
Like the fuckin' big dipper

Do you like it with the lights down low?
They gotta pour a little quicker

Maybe I sleep 'bout falling overboard
I've been up two nights, crashing
On your floor
Something tells me that
I'll never leave
you're no good to me
I'm on my knees, boy
Until you say please

'Til you say please

Boy, you got me wrapped around you so
Never go
Need you on me now
Got me under your control
Every night I'll be back
Slippin'
Trippin'
I will grant you all your wishes

Got me under your control
I'll be all that you've been missing
Maybe I sleep 'bout falling overboard
I've been up two nights, crashing
On your floor
Something tells me that
I'll never leave
you're no good to me
I'm on my knees, boy
Until you say please

'Til you say please
'Til you say please
