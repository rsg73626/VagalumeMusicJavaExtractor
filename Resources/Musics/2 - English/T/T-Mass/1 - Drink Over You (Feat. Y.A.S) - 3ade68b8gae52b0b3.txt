DRINK OVER YOU (FEAT. Y.A.S)

Blackout, numb every part of me
Fucked up, drown in the Hennessy
Too much, never know when it's enough
Enough

So gone, made such a mess of me
You are, the worst of my enemies
Too much, never know when it's enough
Enough

Had enough
Liquor in my love

I ain't gonna drink no more over you
I ain't gonna drink no more over you

It won't stop
Fill you in my glass

I ain't gonna drink no more over you
I ain't gonna drink no more over you

(Made such a mess of me)
(Made such a mess of me)

I ain't gonna drink no more over you
I ain't gonna drink no more over you

Come down, kill pain on top of me
I know, toys of one enemy
Too much, never know when it's enough
Enough

You know, I would've done anything
We all are
a fuck you didn't give for me
Too much, never know when it's enough
Enough

Had enough
Liquor in my love

I ain't gonna drink no more over you
I ain't gonna drink no more over you

It won't stop
Fill you in my glass

I ain't gonna drink no more over you
I ain't gonna drink no more over you

(Made such a mess of me)
(Made such a mess of me)

I ain't gonna drink no more over you
I ain't gonna drink no more over you

(La la la la la la)
