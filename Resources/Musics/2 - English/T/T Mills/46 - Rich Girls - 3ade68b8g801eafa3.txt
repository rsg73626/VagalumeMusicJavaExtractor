RICH GIRLS

I like those rich girls,
with a fist full of rings,
I like those rich girls,
who will buy me things,
i like those rich girls,
in designer jeans,
but i laugh behind their back cause theyre not up on my schemes.


Let me tell you one of my favorite things,
a wealthy girl with no self esteem,
she loves me so at my shows she sings,
as she powders her nose with her bentley keys
but tonight,
its not on me
she got me at the bar with no id,
i got money but i stay lowkey,
if i need my weed i reach in the louie v
this aint nothin new to me
chillin in the back vip
juicy bag and matchin jewelry
girl i think youre the one for me

HEY I just wanna let you know,
your bank account is beautiful


I like those rich girls,
with a fist full of rings,
I like those rich girls,
who will buy me things,
i like those rich girls,
in designer jeans,
but i laugh behind their back cause theyre not up on my schemes.


i wanna see your purse overflow,
come on girl let a little skin show
WOAH
drop it down to the floor
cause im only in town for a night or so
back to the hotel we can go
quiet on the creep so they dont know
and i heard you got money to blow
good thing im here cuz im a pro
ya love youre filthy rich
brand new jeans with the matching kicks
ya girl youre the shit
and your house in the hills is too legit

HEY I just wanna let you know,
your bank account is beautiful


And there has got to be something between
you and me its clear to see


I like those rich girls,
with a fist full of rings,
I like those rich girls,
who will buy me things,
i like those rich girls,
in designer jeans,
but i laugh behind their back cause theyre not up on my schemes.
