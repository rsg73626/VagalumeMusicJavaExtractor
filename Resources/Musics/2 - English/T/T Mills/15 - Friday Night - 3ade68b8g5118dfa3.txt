FRIDAY NIGHT

I go so in that I ain't even out yet
When my record drops imma cop some new outfits
Play a couple shows
Keep my precedence up
I'd like to say I'm sorry to every girl I didn't fuck
I'm kinda pissed of now

So let me tell you what
Every now and then I do drugs for the fuck of it
Try to be a nice dude
Try to keep my mind right
Always be a young fave
Tryna live that high life
All I do is smoke weed
Chill and make cool songs
Kick it with your girlfriend

Probably last an hour long
I be postin twit pics
See I keep my high strong
Plus I'm on a full charge
I be on my I-phone
Gotta keep my friends around
They know how to party right
I just turned twenty-one

Find me on a friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night

I'm in LA everyday puttin time in
You watch me like a g shot girl come be my diamond
We don't don't have to go out
You and I can dine in

And give me all your love
Open up and I will dive in
Girls play me when they're drivin
You hate cause hoes be vibin
I wouldn't fuck with favourites

I'm sure it could get violent
Play you like a violen I'm good on the strings though
Girls be like 'he's hot but he's cuter when he sings though'
'I wonder if he's single?'
It don't matter I've been drinkin
We ain't gotta fuck now
We got the whole weekend

F-find me on a friday night friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night
F-find me on a friday night friday night
