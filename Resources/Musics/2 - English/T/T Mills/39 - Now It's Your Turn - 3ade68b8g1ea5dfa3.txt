NOW IT'S YOUR TURN

I'm ten steps ahead of you,
But I,
But I couldn't be closer to the truth,
But you can stop talking that talking that shit,
Because you already used that excuse,
And I don't have the time to waste on you,
You're clock's so wrong but I'll fix it soon,
You thought you were the one I'd always choose,

Today is the day you learn how to lose,
I've been down,
Again and again,
But now it's your turn,
Wa-oh-oh-oh-oh,

What I found,
Is only the end,
But now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,

I wonder if you'll ever know,
How I,
How I saw you through the tinted glass,
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired,
That's why,
I had to get the fuck out fast,
I never have the heart to waste on you,
You think your braking mine but it isn't true,
I wasn't quite sure how to brake the news,


Today is the day you learn how to lose,
I've been down,
Again and again,
But now it's your turn,
Wa-oh-oh-oh-oh,

What I found,
Is only the end,
But now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,

I'm ten steps ahead of you,
I'm ten steps ahead of you,
I never have the heart to waste on you,
You think you're braking mine but it isn't true,
I wasn't quite sure how to brake the news,

Today is the day you learn how to lose,
I've been down,
Again and again,
But now it's your turn,
Wa-oh-oh-oh-oh,

What I found,
Is only the end,
But now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn,
Now it's your turn to go-o-o-o-o.
