LA IT DOWN

t's Million
from the L dot to the A dot

It ain't really like me to stop what I'm doing
But when you come to town I just might have to do it
And I'm twice as smoother than a razor to your legs yeah
Champagne pouring down your dress out in Vegas

Come on gamble on me cause I need you here
And I'm winin tails, see the cashier
I know a lot of girls who would kill to be you
But they don't appeal to me
So it's all thats in go for the all or leave with nothin'
Girl we about to get it in
I like it like that let me show you something
Come here

LA it down, LA it down
When your plane lands, I hope that you don't make plans
LA it down, LA it down
Tied my schedule for you I got something special for you
LA it down, LA it down
I'll get you out here with me, we'll be sliding through the city
LA it down, LA it down
Got something special for you when you come to California

Just got in we can chill for a little, let me tell you about my new video for a little
We gone make up, bake up breakfast at the griddle
But right about now I would kill for a little piece of that pie
You so sweet girl tell me why
Wanna put whip cream between your thighs then miracle whip my tongue inside

This is your vacation at our undiscovered
Patience, coz all the LA girls hatin wanna come to fuck our functional
I won't let 'em cause you'll leave tomorrow, but you'll be back again
'till then I'll see you

LA it down, LA it down
When your plane lands, I hope that you don't make plans
LA it down, LA it down
Tied my schedule for you I got something special for you
LA it down, LA it down
I'll get you out here with me, we'll be sliding through the city
LA it down, LA it down
Got something special for you when you come to California

Got something special for you when you come to California [x4]

You can stay for whenever, for however long you please
I got you with whatever for forever, come see this routine
Full of traveling will have you coming back to me
Yeah coming back to me, I know

LA it down, LA it down
When your plane lands, I hope that you don't make plans
LA it down, LA it down
Tied my schedule for you I got something special for you
LA it down, LA it down
I'll get you out here with me, we'll be sliding through the city
LA it down, LA it down
Got something special for you when you come to California
