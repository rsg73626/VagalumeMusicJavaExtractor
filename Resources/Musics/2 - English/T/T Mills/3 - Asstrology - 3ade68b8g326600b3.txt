ASSTROLOGY

Girl you must be a gemini
'Cause you love it when there's 2 of you
Don't tell me babe if it's cool with you
Well I guess that's why I'm screwing you
Maybe aries, fire sign, you like it rough no time for love
I knock 'em down you light 'em up
They say life's a bitch mine's fine as fuck,ohh
I bury it, them panties reez such terios
If you give it up I carry it,
You like kissing girls Katty Perry in it
Tell me what you looking for
Tell me why you came
Tell me why you here drinking on the champainge
I'm with that, I get that
I bench press, I lift that
I wrap it up, I gift that
You move it girl, I shift that
The fuck you takin' crixas for
Put away that kodiak
Twisting off that cognac
Tryin' to fuck you in your zodiac

So high,So high,So high,So high
It's like we fucking in the stars,fu-fucking in the stars
Oh my, oh my,oh my
Yeah baby just follow me
You know I got a thing for asstrology
Asstrology,asstrology
You in all that asstrology,asstrology
Yeah

If you a capricorn or a cancer,
Holla up don't answer
I just thought since you was a dancer
And your arms soft so what's after
Word up you a virgo
Down I come from what I heard though
Go away let it bust slow
You're like freaky shit in your scorpio
Nails all on my back,you must be a leo
Swimming in the sheets, watch me do the backstroke
You know what I'm looking for, you can entertain
I'm looking for a sign, is a tated on your frame
I'm a pussy magnet, and girl you're so attractive
Filling corners in that pussy like I'm swerving out a traffic
Aquarius or pisces, make it in all night thing
There's 4 of us if you're a taurus
Getting blown out of my tour bus

So high,So high,So high,So high
It's like we fucking in the stars,fu-fucking in the stars
Oh my, oh my,oh my
Yeah baby just follow me
You know I got a thing for asstrology
Asstrology,asstrology
You in all that asstrology,asstrology
Yeah

You can be my horoscope
Tell me I'm a nice gon' be
I'm tryin' to figure out what nobody knows
So come and put it down on me

So high,So high,So high,So high
It's like we fucking in the stars,fu-fucking in the stars
Oh my, oh my,oh my
Yeah baby just follow me
You know I got a thing for asstrology
Asstrology,asstrology
You in all that asstrology,asstrology
Yeah
