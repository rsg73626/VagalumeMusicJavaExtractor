CRYSTALIZED

What'd you expect constant and graceful
I am so grateful for my problems
Got a plate so i just leave them at the table
Imma ordinary dude, extra ordinary circumstance

I'll take my chances
Oh my b-o
Doubles d on her chest

She knows the peepshow is in my room with a load of people
I think these people have learned how to accept me, except me.
Damn that's cold blooded, how could i even reject me?

Things have gotten closer to the sun
And i've done things in small doses
& don't think that i'm pushing you away
When you're the one that i've kept closest

So hi-i-i-gh so (x3)
This crystal is crisp and all but i cut back on my alcohol
So pass the shit that'll knock me out
Crystalized see you walking out
Crystal eyes, starin' blank

I'm true to me, fuck what you think
Gone-gone for a second there
Glad i'm back, i'd disappear (x2)

Purple pills up in my kitchen wit no name on the prescription
Whatchu' cookin' something different
Showin' them the shit i get is damn
Lose my train of thought
Hate more cause it's all i got

Things have gotten closer to the sun
And i've done things in small doses
& don't think that i'm pushing you away
When you're the one that i've kept closest
So hi-i-i-gh so (x3)

Things have gotten closer to the sun
And i've done things in small doses
& don't think that i'm pushing you away
You're the one that i've kept closet
Hi-i-i-gh (x3)
