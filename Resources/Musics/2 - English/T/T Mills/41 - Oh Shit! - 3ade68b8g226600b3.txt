OH SHIT!

(Hook x2)
I'm that dude, I'm that dude
That got your girlfriend to get my name tattoo'd
Name tattoo,na-name tattoo
And her girlfriend got the same tattoo

(Verse)
Look,your girl got my name tated on her skin now
Tramp stamp,you can see it when bend down
Dude's hate, it ain't concerning me
She got me branded like she joining the fraternity
And I'm a star you looking for you better point far
Combined whips and call it joined cause
Two girls with my name call 'em joint stars
But I let your girl play the one like the poinker
And when I call her mama she say puffy daddy
You getting dirty money, sloppy stacks
She got my name on her neck where they copy that
And her friend got it too I call her copy cat
And I didn't have to say a word, that's just fly thing
So when you kissing on her neck you kissing my name
Hey Mr.Bow life you don't care how he feel
They looking for the one they telling T. Mills

(Hook x2)
I'm that dude, I'm that dude
That got your girlfriend to get my name tattoo'd
Name tattoo,na-name tattoo
And her girlfriend got the same tattoo

(Verse)
Spark my Og,call you Lisa Leslie
I'm a motherfucking king,white Mccraskey
I'm a motherfucking king,Elvis Presley
And my name on your body looks so fucking sexy
6 letters wrap around your wrist
These 6 letters got these bitches wet
It's T Mills, Million or Millie go
You know who I am, pretend you really don't
That's so silly girl with my name on
Yeah what's scares, she ain't up tonight it's Tanya
It's an honour to be odd you love the way it looks
Let me slam you from the cram you like college books
We some odd on kush ups,
Girls who wanna meet us, so eager just to linger
Dedicated getting naked baby let's go to work
Listen while I beat it so let's fuck what you heard

(Hook x2)
I'm that dude, I'm that dude
That got your girlfriend to get my name tattoo'd
Name tattoo,na-name tattoo
And her girlfriend got the same tattoo

(Verse)
I snatched a girl I got a game how you feel
I said what you're name my mind tamed what's the deal
And she said her name was Jane and from there I had to kill
And now she ain't wearing nothing but my name and some heels
Tated from the shoulders down like I'm supposed to do
So when I step in suggest you hold her close to you
All I did is show her how to lack androgens due
Then she got my name blasted 'cause I told her too
She saw me, she seen me deep down
Caught the wave, now I got to get the sleeves out
They ask her who made her do it
Tell 'em Oh dear, a man saw my name and he said, Oh shit!
And I don't really care, 'cause baby I mad rule
And I don't know her name I just call her mine too
She got my name tated on her 'cause I'm that cool
And if your man got a problem with that bottom tattoo
Tell him

(Hook x2)
I'm that dude, I'm that dude
That got your girlfriend to get my name tattoo'd
Name tattoo,na-name tattoo
And her girlfriend got the same tattoo
Oh Shit! Oh Shit!
Oh Shit! Oh Shit!
