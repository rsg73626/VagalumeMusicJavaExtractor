TIK TOK

It's T. Mills

I'm hella gone right now
Ya know, around the clock
That's why I got all this shit
But uh, fuck it
You know, it's like this

I just woke up and I'm still high
Wipe the sleep up out my eyes
Find some weed to my surprise
And a couple girls by my side
With their clothes all on the floor
Hangin' panties on my door
Thinkin' bout' the night before
Like, damn my hips are sore.

[2x]
Won't stop 'till I drop
Smoke some weed and take a shot
Bright lights, living life
Yeah, these girls looking right
Won't stop, make it hot
Watching all these bottles popping, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oooh

I got a girl who look like Ke$ha, yeah, she hella sick
And I got these ladies going Gaga on my disco stick
Tell her wait in line
Unless they fine
Cause' for them, I'll make some time
And if the bitch looks like my ex, I might just hit it from behind
Yo!
She's gunna take her jeans off
Then lick this whipped cream off
And se tik tok, around the clock
And we both don't stop till I end up on top
She loves it when I hit that spot
Fucked in my room and we never got caught
Heeeeh! Naaah. You remember that, don't you? Okay!

[2x]
Won't stop 'till I drop
Smoke some weed and take a shot
Bright lights, living life
Yeah, these girls looking right
Won't stop, make it hot
Watching all these bottles popping, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oooh

I spend my time like my money
Burnin' holes in my pockets, yeaaaah!
Tonight is just one of many
I won't let nothin' stop it
Let nothin' stop it
Let nothin' stop it
I'll never stop (can't stop)
I'll never stop (I want it)
I'll never stop (baby, livin' it up)
We can't stop (can't stop)
We can't stop (I want it)
We can't stop (can't stop)
We can't stop livin' it up

[2x]
Won't stop 'till I drop
Smoke some weed and take a shot
Bright lights, living life
Yeah, these girls looking right
Won't stop, make it hot
Watching all these bottles popping, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
