BUSY BITCH

Fu-fu-fuck around that clock
Fu-fu-fuck around that clock


Deem it,dream it, clean it
So I steam it wanna beam it
Movies scenes sky you've seen it
Meanest slick as 8 a clean it
Never slip in my prescription
It's stored up inside a kitchen
This chaos in the family,
My description Peter Griffin
Beam me up Scotty, pimpin' these girls
Ain't into simpin' they just on the sippin'
On something they can't afford or order women
Or men go swimming I'm gifted like Christmas
What is this business so busy
You fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch


You got a busy bitch
You got a busy bitch
You fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
She fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
Watch your bitch,she Ironman
Got your bitch,the irony
Fu-fu-fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
Fu-fu-fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
Watch your bitch,she Ironman
Got your bitch,
You got a busy bitch


You gotta live it to be
That's why my bitches are meanest
Ta-ta-ta-tated I got the cleanest to meanest
She in the illest position
And I break her like in a mission
Rolling that sticky a icky
I beat it into submission
And you know my weep Europeans
In it,so haters can see in
And yo we came if our bitch is
Ta-ta-tanin' we leaving
I speak it into existence,
Manly is bigger than Jesus
Yeah you could call me conceded
I got your girl on my penis


You got a busy bitch
You got a busy bitch
You fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
She fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
Watch your bitch,she Ironman
Got your bitch,the irony
Fu-fu-fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
Fu-fu-fuck around that clock
You got a busy bitch
Watch your bitch,she Ironman
Got your bitch,
You got a busy bitch
