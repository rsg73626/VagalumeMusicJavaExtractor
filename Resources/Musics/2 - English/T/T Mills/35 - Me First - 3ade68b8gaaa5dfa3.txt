ME FIRST

I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when we lovin`
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun,
So there's nothin left to say

I tried to keep this goin as long as I coulda
Didn't tell you things that I probably shoulda
Things were going great
From the moment that we hooked up
Now your head is down 
And I need you to look up
Not cause I hate you,
I really wanna date you
And just know, nobody can replace you
Not tryna break you
I just wanna make you
See the things that I gotta do for me
Friends tellin you to forget me,
Now they got you wishin that you never met me
In a few years I'll be back if you let me
And when I'm on the road 
It's ok if you text me
If you can't stand it,
Feel like I planned this girl,
Your dead wrong, yeah your dead wrong
I wanna be honest,
I'm just not on it,
But maybe one day, maybe one day

I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when we lovin`
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun,
So there's nothin left to say

It's been a while since we talked last,
Isn't this crazy how fast the time past?
Remember the nights when we would lay awake
And touch on eachother till` the break of day
It's funny how things change
 I hope your doin` great
I found your picture in my wallet
From our first date
I hope you moved on,
But still remember me
This is what I done, atleast we got memories
Don't dwell on it, just smile now
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
Somehow

I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when we lovin`
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun,
So there's nothin left to say

I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when we lovin`
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun,
So there's nothin left to say

(nothin left to say,
So there's nothin left to say,
So there's nothin left to say,
So there's nothin left to say)

I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when we lovin`
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun,
So there's nothin left to say

I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when we lovin`
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun,
So there's nothin left to say
