COLDEST WINTER FT. BLACKBEAR

I always loved when you would wear your favorite sweater
Curl up inside me girl enjoy this world we built together
You got these inhibitions, I had this tunnel vision
You focused on us, I'm focused on myself, forgive me

This could be the coldest winter, that we've ever had here
This could be the coldest winter
Is this how you wanted to start the new year?

Green eyes, red lips, total package, I unwrap the gift
She only 5'5, but she like em tall
Heels on, take em' off
Probably is the coldest winter
Hoppin' not to be alone this winter
I just wanna be home this winter
But this just ain't a house without us in it
Truth is your name
Was the only thing listed on my wish list
Do you miss this?
I know, I broke your heart but I can fix it
We put it in work, I ain't talk about our business
You trust me, I'm gonna go the distance
And I would run right back this instant
I made this for you, I hope you're listening
Merry Christmas

I always loved when you would wear your favorite sweater
Curl up inside me girl enjoy this world we built together
You got these inhibitions, I had this tunnel vision
You focused on us, I'm focused on myself, forgive me

This could be the coldest winter, that we've ever had here
This could be the coldest winter
Is this how you wanted to star the new year?

Act naughty, get cold, every room got a mistletoe
I give religion to these women
You wish you could have kids with
This Christmas drinkin swissmiss
With my mistress in the kitchen
In the valley now I?m just living
Smoking in Cali cal, Just lift it
At the coldest winter room I always
Got a dollar and your in my wish
Tell me how we ended up on this
Man, I really can?t complain about shit
X-mas morning she say my name
Striped lingerie like a candy cane
Before I wrap it up like an ankle sprain
Merry fucking Christmas for the Bear cave in L.A

This could be the coldest winter, that we've ever had here
This could be the coldest winter
Is this how you wanted to start the new year?
