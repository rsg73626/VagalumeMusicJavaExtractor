RIVERSIDE GIRL

And I was somewhere out in London
Wearin' some shit bought in France
But I fell in love with Riverside
And now she wanna hold hands
Well let me see your mutha fuckin' hands

So doe so co all around the globe though
Now ya boy is global
You know I get around the girls that I met
Bring me back to life in Riverside you know you like that
All these girls are like that and I really like that
That's how when I leave I always tell them
I'll be right back, right back
Like that, London for a night cap
Then go where the light's at

Girl you know I like that
You look like a Riverside girl
Got drive from Riverside girl
Slide up in the ride girl
Right into my world
She was my Riverside girl

And I was somewhere out in London
Wearin' some shit bought in France
But I fell in love with Riverside
And now she wanna hold hands
Well let me see your mutha fuckin' hands

So cool so chill and you live at home still
You just pay the phone bill
I know you get tired of the same shit
Show you life outside of Riverside I know you'll like it
All these girls would like that but I never write back
Lets just say another night at my mom and dad's pad
Cat nap like that then
Paris for a backpack then go where the sites at

Girl you know I'm like that
You look like a Riverside girl
Got drive from Riverside girl
Slide up in the ride girl
Right into my world
She was my Riverside girl

And I was somewhere out in London
Wearin' some shit bought in France
But I fell in love with Riverside
And now she wanna hold hands
Well let me see your mutha fuckin' hands

And I just wanna go home
So take me back home girl
And no I can't stay long
But I wanna home girl
And I just wanna go home
So take me back home girl
And no I can't stay long
But I wanna go home

You look like a Riverside girl
Got drive from Riverside girl
Slide up in the ride girl
Right into my world
She was my Riverside girl

And I was somewhere out in London
Wearin' some shit bought in France
But I fell in love with Riverside
And now she wanna hold hands
Well let me see your mutha fuckin' hands
