ON

I get high and pay no mind to people talkin', people talkin'
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin' outta line
Hide this wood, flow don't knock it
Cause when i'm rockin' her eyes poppin' outta socket

Money in my pocket's on the floor
Lock the door
Better then this shit, right here
Ha, have some more

I get high and pay no mind to people talkin', people talkin'
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin' outta line
Girls come around, they don't stop, don't stop

And maybe if she's lucky, i'll just listen to her talk to me
And if i'm not busy, i can probably get her naked, take some pictures, and delete them whenever it is i wake up, wake up
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin', people talkin'
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin' outta line

Crease the beat up, and light my weed up
Stay mind blowin' with my brain, swisher sweet blunt
Ne-high
How i can twist words into pictures
Light the room up like a fixture

My sound is a mixture
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin', people talkin'
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin' outta line
Girls come around, they don't stop, don't stop

And maybe if she's lucky, i'll just listen to her talk to me
And if i'm not busy, i can probably get her naked, take some pictures, and delete them whenever it is i wake up, wake up
If one is not enough, i keep em' comin'

I just want to live long enough to spend some money
Turn this bitch up, huh
Wow, what's funny?

Bitches tellin' me "oh your tattoos are lovely", they love me
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin', people talkin'
I get high and pay no mind to people talkin' fuck

Girls come around, they don't stop, don't stop
And maybe if she's lucky, i'll just listen to her talk to me
And if i'm not busy, i can probably get her naked, take some pictures, and delete them whenever it is i wake up, wake up

Girls come around, they don't stop, don't stop
And maybe if she's lucky, i'll just listen to her talk to me
And if i'm not busy, i can probably get her naked, take some pictures, And delete them whenever it is i wake up, wake up

Don't stop
To her talk
Wake up
