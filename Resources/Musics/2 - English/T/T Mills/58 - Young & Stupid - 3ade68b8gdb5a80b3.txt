YOUNG & STUPID

Life just keeps getting better
Come a long way from the holes on my sweater
My girl go hard a real go get her
Told me that she love me forever (She better)


And if she leaves me for someone cleaver
Find a new chick, cause that shit don't matter
Don't need money when you got good weather
Rolling around the city
No pressure


Oh It's too good to be young and stupid
Baby, oh
It's too good to be young and stupid
Baby


Uh, It just keeps getting better
Life just keeps getting better
It just keeps getting better
Life just keeps getting better


Life just keeps getting better
Cadillac red, everything leather
Got a new girl, she never say never
Anything she up for yeah I'm down down
Love how that booty's so round round
Need a boomerang to get a round round
Yes I got a got buy another round round

Five, ten, twenty out

Oh It's too good to be young and stupid
Baby, oh

Baby


Uh, It just keeps getting better
Life just keeps getting better

What can I say you only live once
Do it big, get in trouble it was still fun
You're jet, you never been on a real one
Back and fourth to the plug till the deals done
So, I guess I cant complain, huh?
Go from that to own another type of plane huh?
But the change did changes
Still we remain us sukka bring are name up
Pop lie like its something to do
But stay your a** right there got something for you
I keep one hundred with you getting true all fair
I run this shit it ain't nothing you can do bout that
No matter what you never keep me outta mind
Ella and hella if you boutta, check I gotta guy
They say never be the failure
But I try and none be the murder
But they hella bad


Oh It's too good to be young and stupid
Baby, oh
