JUST MY LUCK

I met a girl last night
Had her stuck to my side
Drunk, smokin, top flight
We was twistin up the papers too

I rarely drink now-a-days
But t'nights for you
Took her home
said she loved my cologne

So she asked for my shirt
She put it on n' I take it off
Skins baby soft
Let me fuck you rough

Trust me girl skinny dudes throw the dick tuff
I'm crafty
Up inside the club like its Miami
I'm at it

I had to know if we are common habits
I'm swift
With my actions
And honest with attraction

Call em how I see em
And I want you on my mattress
Match this
Gotta whole jar full
Smokin purp

Damn your funny personality is what makes it work
And you can spend your whole life try'n to find the one
Or you can come spend the night and we can have some fun

chorus
sloww down
its just my luck again
she wanna light up in bed (yeah)
she wanna light up in bed (yeah)

I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it in bed (yeah)

She wanna light up in bed (yeah)
I've got some medical
That we can blow
You can be my nurse

My house is the hospital
Lock the door
Rub me down
If we were high it'd feel better then it does right now
Better then it does right now

You see, I always break her off proper
Sex n smokin
Gettin higher then some helicopters
Keep it low key
Like a secret shopper
I got the best trees

Kiss me bitch! Love doctor
So exquisite
Like a cigarette
Your sweet too

Let me taste your licorice
Take a break for a minute
We ain't finished yet
Go until we pass out
Let's see how fuckin high we get

chorus
slow down
its just my luck again
she wanna light up in bed (yeah)
she wanna light up in bed (yeah)

I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it in bed (yeah)

She wanna light up in bed (yeah)
Slow down
It's just my luck again
She wanna light up in bed (yeah)
She wanna light up in bed (yeah)

I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it in bed (yeah)
She wanna light up in bed (yeah)
