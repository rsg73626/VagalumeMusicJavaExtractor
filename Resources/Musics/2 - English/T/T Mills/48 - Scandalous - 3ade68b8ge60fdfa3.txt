SCANDALOUS

I got a girl but she ain't home, you want it huh?
Just come on over, you ain't gotta go, she ain't gotta know
You want it huh, me too now come on over
The light's down, the radio's on
playing my song let me sing it for you
The tape's in, the camera's on
we gonna be here till the morn I got a thing for you
It ain't wrong if I make it feel right
I'ma have you my way, you can fill my appetite
You make me say

Chorus x 2
You so scandalous you so you so scandalous
You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous

I dish it out you eat it up
no loving we just fucking yeah beat it up
With me around it's a wrap
I get that blood pumping call me Mr. Cardiac
The doors locked, the blinds are shut
Let me ask you what, I got a question for you
Let's go again I'm talkin round two we gonna
be here till the morn I got a thing for you
It ain't wrong if you make it feel right
I'ma have you my way, you can fill my appetite
You make me say

Chorus x 2
You so scandalous you so you so scandalous
You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous

Light a candle it's a scandal
Yeah we water gating
Sheets wetter than a fucking water bed breaking
I pull your hair yeah you like it rough
I'm patient girl you tell me when you've had enough
I got my girl we are just some signs but you a center fold
Thank you for the ride come on baby

I'm runnin through it like a stop sign

Chorus x 4
You so scandalous you so you so scandalous
You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous
