GO FOR IT ALL

I don?t wanna be okay, I just need to hear you say
When nothing really goes your way, tomorrow is a brand new day
Let me help you ease your mind, I?mma make you realize
That tonight?s your night

I just want you to fly like a first class ticket on a mission through the sky
Never listen to the lies, keep me racing to the moon
I just be slighter than the whispers in the room
And them critics just assume you will never get do
All the things you really love, such a pessimistic view
Well let me tell you like mama told me
Everything comes back, it?s never always gonna be
So mama never home, and papa never sober
You gotta keep climbin, the top is never closer
The truth is like a fight that?ll take you to the white
And tomorrow gets brighter is you make it through the night, right?
You got it, they can never take it
They just gonna hate it cause they could never make it
Better days are coming in this thing called life
When rain go away a rainbow will say
It?s alright

I don?t wanna be okay, I just need to hear you say
It?s alright
When nothing really goes your way, tomorrow is a brand new day
It?s alright
Let me help you ease your mind, I?mma make you realize
That tonight?s your night
So baby let?s go for it all

Why? You can find a smile
We done made it to the sky, we ain?t never comin down
Remember all the nights you was wishin on a star
I told you if you fight it?ll get you from them all
See? You just gotta say
And I will bring you blue skies I?ll make all your fake friends go away
All they do is throw shade
It?s time to get the sunshine back and watch all these gray clouds blow away
Okay you got it, they could never stop it
They just gonna hate it cause they could never top it
And even if you block it there?s gotta be a way out
If our work pay off there?s gotta be a pay out
Stay on start of bizzoc, stack your own brizzocks
Into a building when you was feeling light
Giving up you never did
So I just came to let you know that if you never hit
It?s alright

I don?t wanna be okay, I just need to hear you say
It?s alright
When nothing really goes your way, tomorrow is a brand new day
It?s alright
Let me help you ease your mind, I?mma make you realize
That tonight?s your night
So baby let?s go for it all

Keep your eyes to the skies
And baby, we?ll go for it all
Don?t ask why, that?s just life
So baby, let?s go for it all

I don?t wanna be okay, I just need to hear you say
It?s alright
When nothing really goes your way, tomorrow is a brand new day
It?s alright
Let me help you ease your mind, I?mma make you realize
That tonight?s your night
So baby let?s go for it all
