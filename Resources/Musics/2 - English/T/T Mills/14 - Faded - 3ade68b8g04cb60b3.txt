FADED

I don't want your name and I don't want your number
I just want your body in my bed underneath the covers
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Look at you, cause I've been looking all night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I said look at you, cause If I look somethings
But you look alright

Baby, I'm wasted (wasted)
All I wanna do is drive home to you
Baby, I'm faded (faded)
All I wanna do is take you downtown

She's something like a novel
But the one that you can't finish
She's fuck like we're mad
But our friendship is benefitting
Let it burn tho
Candles on, that's a
Yeah, I've been sppin and yeah I've been smokin?
But that ain't your concern tho
There's no contemplation, no hesitation
I look in your eyes, I can read you
And girl I can tell that you want me
I want you but no, I don't need you
I love when your panties are see through
I grip and I'm in it do please you
You take a receive
Believe in me
You asked if we don't I say please do
Please do and ok them
You only smoke on occasion, ain't got the best reputation
Quick fuse, no patience
I like bad girls who need savin
Thats what you call a bad habit
Everytime I watch you go
That ass has me like 'God damnit' imagine that
Got me bad
We only fuck when we're fucked up
What you call in that?
Miss you when I'm faded
Kiss you when I'm drunk
I know a lot a guys will be line up
But you just wanted the one
You want the one

All I wanna do is take you downtown
