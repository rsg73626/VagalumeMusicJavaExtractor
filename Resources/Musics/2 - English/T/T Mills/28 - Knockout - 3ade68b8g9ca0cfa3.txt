KNOCKOUT

And yo I'm doin it solo like hans
unique over beats so you know I drop bombs
bitch look me up, tattoos in my palms
so I'm gettin wetter than a fish in a pond
but I play it safe always wear a condom
lifestyles tend to break so I rock magnums
yo I ain't from the bay but I make her go dumb
she said mills I ain't gonna stop 'til I make you cum

You can love me or you can hate me
You can fuck me or you can date me
Call me asshole or call me baby
I dont really care its all the same thing

I got a style so pure it'll leave your face numb
high off my lines over snare and bass drums
hooked to my hooks you can't help but listen
and everything's better with some kush in my system
if life is a bitch then I got a trophy wife
and I just wanna get some cut like a knife
hey girl whats up for tonight
cause I wanna see what it's like from the inside

You can love me or you can hate me
You can fuck me or you can date me
Call me asshole or call me baby
I dont really care its all the same thing
