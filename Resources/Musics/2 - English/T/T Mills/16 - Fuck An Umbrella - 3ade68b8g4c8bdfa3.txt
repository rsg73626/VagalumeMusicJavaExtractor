FUCK AN UMBRELLA

If you feel me then you know what this is all about
Wow did i just take it there now
How did someone have the audacity
To come after me taxin my master peice

Nah they wont get no stacks off me
Fuck em once, fuck em twice now heres three
Speak shame on my name to inprove game
But your girlfriends friend told me everything

Yea you should watch who your talkin to
Break you back please dont plan on walkin through
I'll throw a bitch in the window of your livin room
Strap the cash in and i need my fucking answer soon

Or ill have a second album up for ransom suit
Cause i just cant comprehend how you could do that to a friend
I hope you lay awake in bed at night and just think and just think
One day ima make it rain,

N i'ma laugh all the way to the bank,
Saying fuck an umbrella fuck an umbrella
Fuck an umbrella fuck an umbrella
Ima keep my head up

Do my own thing thru all this bullshit
Saying fuck fake friends and bitches
I only trust music music
It's not about the money for me its about my team

I've been heavy in some shit and now im finally clean
It's ironic how a label that doesnt have any green
Wants to hold a kid back from persuing a life dream
What the fuck does that make me

Dollar signs in your eyes thats why this song is free
Cause i could give a fuck about all your problems save it
Youll be sorry when im rich and famous bruh
This business is shameless thats why to me 
You'll forever remain nameless

Yea forgettin where I came from shit 
I've done eveything since day one
Um ima keep pushing these envelopes 
Let's see whos the first to leave
Plus I know im always in the lead
Plus i'm the reason that my album leaked

One day ima make it rain,
N i'ma laugh all the way to the bank,
Saying fuck an umbrella fuck an umbrella
Fuck an umbrella fuck an umbrella
Ima keep my head up

Do my own thing thru all this bullshit
Saying fuck fake friends and bitches
I only trust music music
Ima live in the sky some day
I'll be sure not to let you know

And i think i found a way to not say a word but get your secrets told
Ima live in the sky some day
Ill be sure not to let you know
And i think i found a way to not say a word but get your secrets told

One day ima make it rain,
N i'ma laugh all the way to the bank,
Saying fuck an umbrella fuck an umbrella
Fuck an umbrella fuck an umbrella

Ima keep my head up
Do my own thing thru all this bullshit
Saying fuck fake friends and bitches
I only trust music music
