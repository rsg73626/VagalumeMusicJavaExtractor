LEAVING HOME

[Verse 1]
I love the way home feels and smells,
Been here since 12,
Thats where I tripped,
Thats where I fell,
I sleep by that tree and dreamt so well,
I never knew ah girl like you ah
And I sure won't meet another
But if you cant see
That this old street isnt big enough for me then

We live in different places Imma just go, Imma just go [X2]

[Chorus]
You can stay in the small town
But Imma breakout
I'd rather lose your love then have to stay and live in doubt
Now im leaving home
For another place on a different street in a different state
Now im leaving home cause you always say its the only way you'd wish I'd stay
Now im leaving home im leaving home

[Verse 2]
I can find a place thats well a good as well as you
But I need change and change needs me too
I cant come second but first of all its not my fault
You maye hate me tryna blame me your friends wont hear my side at all
We'll split and tear bid farwell you told me im not welcome here
We can laugh it off
Over coffee when I visit next year
Its just the

We've been in different places, Imma just go, Imma just go [X2]

[Chorus]
You can stay in the small town
But Imma breakout
I'd rather lose your love then have to stay and live in doubt
Now im leaving home
For another place on a different street in a different state
Now im leaving cause you always say its the only way you'd wish I'd stay
Now im leaving home im leaving home

Wacth me go [X2]

We've been in different places Imma just go, Imma just go [X4]

[Chorus]
You can stay in the small town
But Imma breakout
I'd rather lose your love then have to stay and live in doubt
Now im leaving home
For another place on a different street in a different state
Now im leaving home cause you always say its the only way you'd wish I'd stay
Now im leaving home, im leaving home

We've been in different places [X5]
