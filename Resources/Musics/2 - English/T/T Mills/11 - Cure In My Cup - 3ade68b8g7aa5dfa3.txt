CURE IN MY CUP

I go I got the cure in my cup x2
Girls got me rushing with the pussy got me hungry
I like my hoes flexible
In my mouth like gum bitch
They come out at gun speed
They don't know what hit em
They keep coming back for more and that's when I just quit em
I talk on my phone just so shell leave me alone
Just because we fuck doesn't mean ill take you home
Hoe you got to go
Hoe you got to go
Cause I do my own thing and if you didn't now you know

I sit back and smoke hill
Life Is fucking short and that's why I live for thrills
Eyes hella pill
Favorites with me still
I know im not perfect this is just how I deal
Comin hell heavy with a secret
Cure in my cup and I'm about to drink it
Everything's better when I'm leanin
I've figured this shit out so now I will be screamin

Show me a good time
I wanna feel like this all night
I got I got I got that cure in my cup
We got bitches in the back
Yea they throw there hands up
We flyin what we drivin
We don't give a fuck
I got that cure in my cup

I hang out late with girls from different states
Cool for a night but not the type I would date
They give me weed so I guess I'm down to kick it
And they swear they don't but I know they wanna picture
Blow it in they face if they don't wanna hit it
Cause I'm getting everything bitch I'm in the triple digits
Cold hard cash money chillin in the fridge's
I don't have a bank account I just keep it in my kitchen
I do shit different better then you thought I would
I cant even think right now but even though I probly should
Im with the futuristic timeless
Im a break her back spineless
But if tonight takes a turn for the worst the cure in my cups gunna quench my thirst
Ya you got in the party but you showed up first
I showed up late with good times to disperse

Show me a good time
I wanna feel like this all night
I got I got I got that cure in my cup
We got bitches in the back
Yea they throw there hands up
We flyin what we drivin
We don't give a fuck
I got that cure in my cup

Don't forget don't forget the rest
I wont forget I wont forget the rest of me
I let it get I let it get the best of me

Comein hell heavy with a secret
Cure in my cup and im about to drink it
Everything better when im leanin
I've figured this shit out so now I will be screamin

Show me a good time
I wanna feel like this all night
I got I got I got that cure in my cup
We got bitches in the back
Yea they throw there hands up
We flyin what we drivin
We don't give a fuck
I got that cure in my cup x2
