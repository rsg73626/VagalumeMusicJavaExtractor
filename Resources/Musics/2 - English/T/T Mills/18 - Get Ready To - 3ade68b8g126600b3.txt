GET READY TO

I just wanna make a little som-somethin' 
you can get ready to,ready to
Damn look at you, look at you
Damn look at you, look at you
I just wanna make a little som-somethin' 
you can get ready to,ready to
Damn look at you, look at you
Damn look at you, look at you

Now all my girls getting ready right now
Don't ever be afraid to get wild
I was thinking just a little som-somethin' for women
And my city getting ready then could bump this
Even the ex was that I'm still in love with
I swear to God I'll still be running into other functions
I'm on that shit your new man can't fuck with
Intelligent gentleman never put her with a dumb bitch
I used to date 'em now I hate 'em could've shake 'em off
Same bitches at every party yeah I fucked them all
Uh,just shut up and get ready honey
I'm just heading towards the money wondering if you're coming
Regarded a little higher than your boyfriend is
Why is he always getting mad about some boyfriend shit
Man I kick it even when it says the place close
You wouldn't know you probably hang out where the lanes go
Singing the same songs to all of the same hoes
She's ready to leave home she's thinking a way dope
I was thinking


I just wanna make a little som-somethin' 
you can get ready to,ready to
Damn look at you, look at you
Damn look at you, look at you
I just wanna make a little som-somethin' 
you can get ready to,ready to
Damn look at you, look at you
Damn look at you, look at you

Shit I'm ready to drain, and if you wanna come along
We could intervene
I don't think I've ever mentioned you on magazines
Shit all the women get sick of just flickin' the beans
Washing all of the best sheets couple times a week
I'm getting ready for whatever you know what I mean
Blow a bowl up in the shower just smoking some weed
Mascara with your hair is really all I need
Ah damn,look at you
That shirt has never cut as low as you wanted it too
That booty's always shaking making me wanted to move
It's like she's going downtown with something to prove
And with this album coming out I got nothing to lose
To all the women getting ready I made it for you
I call her soon as I'm finished with video shoots
Invinting all of them over I love them in groups
I was thinking


I just wanna make a little som-somethin' 
you can get ready to,ready to
Damn look at you, look at you
Damn look at you, look at you
I just wanna make a little som-somethin' 
you can get ready to,ready to
Damn look at you, look at you
Damn look at you, look at you
