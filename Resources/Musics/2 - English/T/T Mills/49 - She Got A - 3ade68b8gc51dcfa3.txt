Who got a pink Range
And she drives fast in the slow lanes
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new.

I smoke like a motha fucking chimney
Laughing with my eyes closed
Yellin' Bret cig me.
But thats neither here nor there
'Cause when I talk ya hear thoughts so rare
I'm finna be on clap your hands say "Yeah"
The weight of my mistake
I need an ounce in a bag
Super high me flow
On the champagne campaign
Elect me I popped every bottle ever made
Expect me I ducked every model when they came
They be hittin' my line and I just let it rain
Split a swisher
With your sister 'cause she kissed her
Consider her so pretty
Yo with this shit I whispered
Recite some old lyrics
Make a bitch fall in love
Then Im on to the next 'cause one is not enough
One is not enough
Nah, one is not enough
But if she brings a friend I know is finna get rough

I fucked this white girl
Who got a pink Range
And she drives fast in the slow lanes
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new

But do I love her?
No
Im unstoppable
I cant see you
You're unwatchable
Like a motha fuckin broken t.v.
If you could turn it on you'd probably see me

Take notes when I speak
Shit is cruical
I am highly educated
Im 'bout to school ya
Im on the next weed shit
It aint cool yet
I got the bitches leakin
Man, Im talkin pool wet
You get nothin for free around here
Im gonna be huge this time next year
You wanna ride the dick
Better get a new idea
Im a sittin, sippin sysurp
Like a hipster in Ikea
I got my middle finger up
Ask me how I feel
I just couldnt give a fuck
Travis T Mills

But call me Million if you know me
And if your girlfriend got an ass she can show me
(And if your girlfriend got a mouth she can blow me, haha)

You know what it is
Its T Mills
