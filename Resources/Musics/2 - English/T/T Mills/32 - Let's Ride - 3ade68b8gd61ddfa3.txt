LET'S RIDE

Listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

I got a lot of things I need to figure out
Hop in the front seat and empty this grape swisher out
Cold in my blunt seat, never roll the windows down
Friends hop in, quick the trip is near started now
Four wheel coastin'
Goin' lean my seat back
Drunk driving music
Open up that six pack
I don't know what traffic is
They don't know where Travis is
Probably on the road where my camp, causin' havoc its
Summer time bitch
Picture me rollin'
I do what I please and I live in the moment
I'm just a young favorite
Hear my voice and savor it
The open road is much like home
And I love it like it raised me

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

I ain't stoppin' 'til I have to
Everybody buckle up it's gonna be a fast one
Yeah, I see those red lights
I'm finna go blast 'em
We all got that red I space side like NASA
Grip the wheel tight when I'm swervin
We just hot boxed the suburban
See the smoke pourin' out 'cause we burnin'
This is the shit you forget after learnin'
But you know who taught it to you first
Picture me rollin'
I do what I please and I live in the moment
We got all the time to waste
Bank accounts and half a tank
We movin'
We movin'
We on our way

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

Just listen when you drive
Let the music get you high
And let's ride, let's ride
You can see it in your eyes
Steady cruisin' through the night
And let's ride
