DIEMONDS

We are diemonds
But we gonna shine forever
Like diemonds in the sky
When they carry me home
When I'm gone
Still be seen on million years after

We are die-we are die-we are diemonds

Stand in the club, can't get it back
Money make the world go 'round
Got me livin' life fast, just like that
He could all in right now
Tell 'em tell 'em die-d-die keep it up when it all falls down
Tell 'em tell 'em die-d-die keep it up when it all falls down
'cause this is how it feels when you find yourself
Kinda like a diemond you mind yourself
Mind of a matter
Time going better
Remember to remind yourself

We are diemonds
But we gonna shine forever
Like diemonds in the sky
When they carry me home
Whem I'm gone
Still be seen on million years after

We are die-we are die-we are diemonds

I ain't gotta prize up staying my life
Imma leave ir up in the air
Thinkin bout a highside
Change my life
Never said life fair
Tell 'em tell 'em die-d-die keep it up when it all falls down
Tell 'em tell 'em die-d-die keep it up when it all falls down
'cause this is how it feels when you find yourself
Kinda like a diemond you mind yourself
Mind of a matter
Time going better
Remember to remind yourself

We are diemonds
But we gonna shine forever
Like diemonds in the sky
When they carry me home
Whem I'm gone
Still be seen on million years after

We are die-we are die-we are diemonds

We don't wish a star
That just how we are

We are die-we are die-we are diemonds

We are diemonds
But we gonna shine forever
Like diemonds in the sky
When they carry me home
Whem I'm gone
Still be seen on million years after

We are die-we are die-we are diemonds
