KOCAINE KISSES

Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it
Cocaine neverywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it

All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
Just to go and do their fucking lines in the bathroom
We don't trip I don't judge you
I just make you feel like I love you
Than I take you back and I fuck you
Oh now you want me to cuff you
Number 1 rule, like but don't trust you
Let's chop it up like I drugged you
Put you on the floor like I rugged you
You make some Miley song when I touch you
With my fingertips and leave fingerprints
But it's been a long time I ain't seen you since
The last time we took flight a bag of that white
Remember that night when we had

Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it
Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it

All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
Just to go and do their fucking lines in the bathroom
Cocaine that's what you said you need
We got that, I'mma go roll my blunt
Than we can proceed you chop chop chop
Line it all up then you feel like you can fly
I break it down, roll it all up then
I begin to get high
Ok now line it up and then fuck
Line it up and then function
Girl you fine as fuck and
I like that bag you brought your drugs in
'Cause both of them are designer
Scale full of dire powder
Better bump this, well you bump this
It ain't sugar and that ain't flour
Stay up for half an hour
Let me fuck you in the shower
'Cause the last time we took flight a bag of that white
Remember that night when we had

Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it
Cocaine everywhere

Co-Co-Co-Cocaine everywhere
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it

And you never really blown away
So your face is numb
You say your face is numb
And you don't wanna go away
So your face is numb
You say your face is numb

Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it
Baby you want it, you need it
We got it, come and get it
