GIRLS GONE WILD

Shutup girl, i know just what youre thinking
Pink stuff in my cup thats what im drinking

Damn it feels so good to be young
Cmon love before the night is done
We need to
Get away
Ive been lookin at you but i didnt know what to say
And lets take our time
Let me get inside
Lets take out time
Let me get inside

Shes pullin at my shirt
And shes tearing off my jeans she said
I love your tattoos and the way you sing
Shes pullin at my shirt
And shes tearing off my jeans she said
I love your tattoos and the way you sing

She says im everything she needs
I say shes coming home with me
She says im everything she needs
I say shes coming home with me

Im at the club its like girls gone wild
Im on my bus its like girls gone wild
Fucking with us is like girls gone wild
I havent fucked this many girls in a while

I need a girl who knows how to party hard
Takin off her pants rackin lines with her credit card
Off with the top gettin down on some shots
Shes screamin every evening begging me dont stop
I need a girl whos down to get naked
Get drunk and come over maybe we can tape it
And baby girl you should probably just face it
Im the fuckin best im so high i need a spaceship

Im at the club its like girls gone wild
Im on my bus its like girls gone wild
Fucking with us is like girls gone wild
I havent fucked this many girls in a while
