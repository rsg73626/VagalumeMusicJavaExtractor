well I was never meant to work
but right now its fuckin crunch time
grab your trays and get served
like a highschool lunch line
bitch

they love you when youre hot
but they hate you when youre not
when i pull up to the spot
i make your girls jaw drop
ive never been shy
and your lucky im alive
because if i wasnt here
youd have no way to get inspired
damn
and you know nobody higher
look up in my eyes and you can tell i blow that fire
call that shit desire, the shit that makes you tighter
im just trying to stack some money up and then retire
show me the money like jerry mcguire
cruisin down pch with my own driver
im great, like tony the tiger
bowl of frosted flakes eat it every single night cuz
im makin my grand entrance in the room
and im trying to play it cool but im trippin off shrooms
and i cant tell up from down
left from right but your diggin my sound
this goes down when i sing my hooks
make the girls fall in love open up like books
this shit is bananas just like gwen stefani
and i swear your girls trying to be my babys mommy
the girl in my car is the girl at the bar
she says your a lame man your chillin subpar
i got wood like tiger, man they wanna flaunt me
i have dreams about my past and that shit haunts me
now im just trying to live my life the best i can
making moves so the money ends up in my hands
some bitches hate me and the other ones are fans
its cause i put it down like no one else can
oh no
im about to go back in again
chillin in a room with seven white women
sinnin again swimmin in money because i love it
i be poppin bottles in public like FUCK IT
been waitin on my time to shine
found my hustle, found my grind
im only gonna tell you motherfuckers this
one more time
