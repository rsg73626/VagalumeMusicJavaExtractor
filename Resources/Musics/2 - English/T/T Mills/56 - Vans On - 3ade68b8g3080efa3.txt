VANS ON

Hey, they don't know a thing about us
Only love 'em for the moment
Oh oh ohhh
Tell 'em they don't know a thing about us
All the sweet left for you suckas
I don't treat 'em, I don't love 'em,
I fuck 'em with my Vans on 
They calling me a bad motha fucka yeah
Damn, they don't know a thing about us
Only love 'em for the moment

Uhh, she says "Mills, you're my superhero"
But I'm just trying to hug her curves
Like a new Camaro,
I tell her that she got that kush then I laugh it off
'Cause that just means
That I hit it twice before I pass it off
Yeah, I'm the shit this year I tell a bitch get here,
Get your lipstick smeared
Don't get it twisted, baby girl get this shit clear
I don't know why I don't fall in love, 
I'm on my pimp shit here but
I can be your drill sergeant you know give you major pain

We can make magic
And then I can pull a David Blaine,
I tend to make a habit out of that, I swear sometimes I feel
Like I can pull a rabbit out a hat
But that don't mean I'm trickin' though, 
That means I be trickin' hoes
Yeah hoe I be trippin'
But on this trip you don't get to go
I'm in a rush to get this dough and I ain't finna way,
I'm just trying to fuck and send 'em home
Evacuate

Hey, they don't know a thing about us
Only love 'em for the moment
Oh oh ohhh
Tell em the don't know a thing about us
All the sweet left for you suckas
I don't treat 'em, I don't love 'em
I fuck 'em with my vans on (vans on)
They calling me a bad motha fucka yeah
Damn, they don't know a thing about us
Only love 'em for the moment

I need one to roll my weed up, 
one to come my shows
The same one to roll my trees up and also iron my clothes
I think I like them in threes, though
Because three is better than dos
And by dos I mean them Spanish ones
Angelina and Rose
So what's happenin' babe, what's happenin'
My hair long and her hair did,
I'm tatted, she tatted
She careful and I'm careless,
And I'm swaggin', she swaggin'
Most hate but she don't care bitch,
But this just for tonight, I'ma circle back to your square ritz

Carlton, like Fresh Prince but I be like a white Will
Backwards, had huge grand, six gold, bottom grill
Shits real, I'm hittin' kill
Paper stuff, Max peel
Gotta beat you home, my shit and steal
Huh deal or no deal?
Woo, she just want to be with me cause
She know that I'm almost rich
Hoes comin', they go faster
Than slow life of a young favorite
She want a relationship, but baby mine don't last long,
Let me take these slippers off and
Fuck you with my vans on

Hey, they don't know a thing about us
Only love 'em for the moment
Oh oh ohhh
Tell 'em they don't know a thing about us
All the sweet left for you suckas
I don't treat 'em, I don't love 'em
