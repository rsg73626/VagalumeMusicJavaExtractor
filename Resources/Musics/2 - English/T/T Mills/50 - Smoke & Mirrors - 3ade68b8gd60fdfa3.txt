SMOKE & MIRRORS

Smoke & mirrors x 4

Even stars burn out
Its funny how they hate
But im all they talk about
Doubts were a constant thing
I was in constant need of we constantly
Now my concert fee
Has me never lookin back again

Chorus
All these people try to pull me down
Tellin me you aint gonna make it, you aint gonna make it
But im not breakin
All these people try to fool me now
Askin me when we gonna kick it when I get different
But im not slowin down

Switch on once I get my rich on
I take a picture of my dick for em to put them lips on
I aint no fast one last long
Get up on my fashion
How you talkin shit but stalkin pics from what I have on?
Damn change the subject cause lately im like fuck it
But its funny how my haters aint gonna say no shit in public
Got my youngins
And if you didn't hear it it's mother fuckin (?)
And anybody near it
That's the spirit
Get too close and ima lose you
Your mind is a powerful thing, do what you choose to
And just to make shit a lil clear I know some fake mother fuckers
Yes ill smoke in pairs, let em know

Chorus
All these people try to pull me down
Tellin me you aint gonna make it, you aint gonna make it
But im not breakin
All these people try to fool me now
Askin me when we gonna kick it when I get different
But im not slowin down

People come and people go, I'd like to think I did this all on my own
People come & people go, ohhhh, people go



Chorus
All these people try to pull me down
Tellin me you aint gonna make it, you aint gonna make it
But im not breakin
All these people try to fool me now
Askin me when we gonna kick it when I get different
But im not slowin down
