HARD TO STAY SOBER

Far from cheap she say my watch is expensive
I résumé she say that shit extensive, the champagne
I tell her complementary
Baby I'm hella young
I say that's elementary
So I roll up a 8th make some mistakes
Call a few bitches and they're on the way
She light up a j she open her legs
A night of yo life that's a regular day yeah
I does this high of a life

I'm public
I chronically get wild head but nah I never rush it
Can't touch this I like girls and trees
Mary jane moly me can't stand to be not faded
So I'm always doing laundry

Girls come and they go girls (?)
Guaranteed she loves milli when she's dancing up on that pole
We got some freaks in the living room
Models in the swimming pool
And I'd rather be with you instead
I swear it's getting to my head
That's why it's hard to stay
It's hard to stay sober yeah

You know we always celebrating
So it's hard to stay sober
Bitch it's easy coming thru
But it's harder to stay over most
You ever gonna get its some sex and a make over
One in one out and I race it and tape over
Came a long way from white girls and range rovers
I'm taking down the pussy like I was a train soldier

Super hero serving the dick and some plane (clothing?)
I got chicks in the cube they ain't cloaking my game's frozen
My bitch hotter than the summer
But I swear her name is hotter
I'll make a daddy hide his daughter
I'm good looking bitch I'm awesome

Girls come and they go girls (?)
Guaranteed she loves milli when she's dancing up on that pole
We got some freaks in the living room
Models in the swimming pool
And I'd rather be with you instead
I swear it's getting to my head
That's why it's hard to stay
It's hard to stay sober yeah
