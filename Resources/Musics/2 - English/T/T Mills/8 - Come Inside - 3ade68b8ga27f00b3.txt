COME INSIDE

Just put yor key up inside that
Lock for me
Open up cold out here
I'll warm you up like the way
Your shower does
I'll kiss that spot behind your ear

When were laying down
Everything
I'm saying now
Will have you thanking me
And
Begging me to stay the night

Not even asking how
Not understanding why
Without you i just don't
Sleep right

Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
(i will always)

Come through for
You baby

Come through for
You

I'll never let you down
Lets take our time
We of age lets drink some wine
I'll kiss your neck you scrath my
Back
You tell me where you want it
At

And you already know I stay real
close to your area code
But your areas cold
For it's made for adults
Imma love you down never let you go

When were laying down
Everything
I'm saying now
Will have you thanking me
And
Begging me to stay the night

Not even asking how
Not understanding why
Without you i just don't
Sleep right

Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
(i will always)

Come through for
You baby

Come through for
You

You've been thinking
Bout
Leaving out a key for
Me

Free

Gotta know girl

Can i come inside?
Can i come inside?
