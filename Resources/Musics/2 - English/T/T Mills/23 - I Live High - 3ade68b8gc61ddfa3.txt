I LIVE HIGH

It came back around again
I never saw a thing
I used to be down and out but now 
I'm lovin' everything
Things ain't never been better
I ain't feel this good ever
I love being clever with every letter 
I used to send her

I've been waiting yeah
I've been waiting for a long time to finally feel like this because
I've been waiting yeah
I've been waiting for a long time
To see the things I couldn't

I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high
I don't hear what they gotta say
I get mine, I get mine, I get mine
And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em)
They'll never know a thing (a thing)
I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high

I love my life that I'm livin'
I could paint pictures so vivid
The places I stay
The things that I've seen
The women I've been with

I do what I wanna do
Be what I wanna be
Say what I wanna say
See what I wanna see
And can I talk honestly?
I'm not good with apologies

I've been waiting yeah
I've been waiting 
for a long time to finally 
feel like this because
I've been waiting yeah
I've been waiting for a long time
To see the things I couldn't
One:

I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high
I don't hear what they gotta say
I get mine, I get mine, I get mine
And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em)
They'll never know a thing (a thing)
I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high

And these shoes have no sole left for walkin'
And my throat is on fire from talkin'
You say that I've changed, I'm the same
You say that I've changed, I'm the same
I won't give into your games
I cannot say that I'll remember your name

I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high
I don't hear what they gotta say
I get mine, I get mine, I get mine
And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em)
They'll never know a thing (a thing)
I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high

I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high
I don't hear what they gotta say
I get mine, I get mine, I get mine
And they can think what they want about me because they'll never know, (fuck 'em)
They'll never know a thing (a thing)
I don't care what comes my way
I live high, I live high, I live high
