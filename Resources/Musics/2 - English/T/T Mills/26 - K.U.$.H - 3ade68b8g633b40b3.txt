K.U.$.H

I can't believe I got so high
Smoke clouds, the sun so high
I'm so high, I forgot that line
I can't forget about riverside
The side
But on a road day say all I do is role up
Yeah I smoke
They mad 'cause keeping up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Pass that kush
It got the girls in the cars
Looking so hard
They can't catch me dawg
'Cause keepin' up so hard

(Verse)
Welcome to my room that high room
Double X's kill zone
Double up and extendo there
Make sure that it's real long
I'm smoking on that Schwarzenegger
That Iron man, I'm still gone
Basically what I'm saying is
I've been smoking on this real strong
Keeping up is so hard, life is moved so fast
Yesterday in my rear view, and life's full on the gas
We used to be in the same position so I get just why you mad
You run a 60 in less than 10 in a row I'm speeding of in that ass
I'm elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high
Elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high
Elevating, levitated, elevated I'm high
I'm elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high

(Hook)
I can't believe I got so high
Smoke clouds, the sun so high
I'm so high, I forgot that line
I can't forget about either side
The side
But on a road day say all I do is role up
Yeah I smoke
They mad 'cause keeping up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Pass that kush
It got the girls in the cars
Looking so hard
They can't catch me dawg
'Cause keepin' up so hard

(Verse)
Ride, let me put you on something only I know
When the chief and me are are hauling
I have sold it 'cause I smoke
I love bud even my shane's smoking
See that fucking gray clouds like the rain coming
Yeah my rain coming, watch me fly pass
To the top way higher than my high ass
Uh, these OG's in east LA
So loud wish I had this on beats by Dre's
I'm a rock star, fucking Pat star
Light up anywhere 'cause I'm not sure
I'm the kush God fuck with you dawg
Know when I come do make sure you dissabled them alarms
Some burnin' down your domes spare cases of spack alleys
And get schooled rolling up at your pap rallies
Tryin' to cop a sack then get at me
Got some shit sure to make you happy
I'm elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high
Elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high
Elevating, levitated, elevated I'm high
I'm elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high

(Hook)
I can't believe I got so high
Smoke clouds, the sun so high
I'm so high, I forgot that line
I can't forget about either side
The side
But on a road day say all I do is role up
Yeah I smoke
They mad 'cause keeping up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Pass that kush
It got the girls in the cars
Looking so hard
They can't catch me dawg
'Cause keepin' up so hard

(Verse)
I like blue drain, blueberry
At the house watching Halle Berry
Movies with cool bees in jacuzzi's
They blow me when they smoking up in that four way
Blasting off in that Oh Yeah
Your girlfriend, your ex shaking your neck
Shake they all here
Oh yeah that's 12 months, 12 girls I had once
2 girls I had twice and they both arrived on the same night
Same time and their names wrong
Slam dunk I got hang time
One blunt, smoked an 8th of weed
And you still blowing that same dime
I'm elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high
Elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high
Elevating, levitated, elevated I'm high
I'm elevated, levitated, elevated I'm high

(Hook)
I can't believe I got so high
Smoke clouds, the sun so high
I'm so high, I forgot that line
I can't forget about either side
The side
But on a road day say all I do is role up
Yeah I smoke
They mad 'cause keeping up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Keepin' up so hard
Pass that kush
It got the girls in the cars
Looking so hard
They can't catch me dawg
'Cause keepin' up so hard
