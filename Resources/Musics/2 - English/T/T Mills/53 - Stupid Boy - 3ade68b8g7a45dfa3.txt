STUPID BOY

Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
Drink up 'till
You can't think anymore

Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
I ain't gonna change 
I'm not just a stupid boy

I do, everything I want to
Last night
Was something I wish I knew
You hate 
All the games that I put
You through

No I ain't gonna change 
No ain't gonna change for you
I'm a smart dude 
I'm try'na get my learn on
You got your girls and
They're all fine 
Lets got get our burn on

I love the way I'm feeling
Single, searching for the evening
You can spend the night 
If you don't plan on us both sleeping

Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
Drink up 'till you can't
Think anymore
Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
I ain't gonna change 
I'm not just a stupid boy

I'm not looking for my one
I'm looking for my righ now
And baby we just way
Too young for me to settle down
I know want I'm doing love
Keep the game just trust me

I'm stupid so please give
Me brain and afterwards just fuck me
I do, everything I want to
I wish I would have 
Know what you could do

You think everything that 
I said is true
I ain't gonna change 
I ain't gonna change for you

Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
Drink up 'till you can't
Think anymore
Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor 
I ain't gonna change
I'm not just a stupid boy

I'm tryna cut you wanna what?!
I'm tryna cut you wanna what?!
I'm tryna cut you wanna
Make love, make love
I'm tryna cut you wanna what?!
I'm tryna cut you wanna what?!
I'm tryna cut you wanna
Make love, make love

Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
Drink up 'till you can't
Think anymore
Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor
Get low, get loose
Get down on the floor

I ain't gonna change
I'm not just a stupi boy
Stupid boy
