NIGHT LIFE

I wanna party let's get drunk
I'm gonna grab another cup
And let's smoke another blunt
We ain't stoppin never stoppin
I wanna party let's get drunk
I'm gonna grab another cup

And let's smoke another blunt
We ain't stoppin til the sun comes up
It's a friday night and
I don't plan on sleepin soon
I'm looking for a ten
But shes locked in the bathroom

I'll just find another one
The night is young
I'm having fun
Killed two forties, twerped one up
And now i'm chillin done
How come,
All of these girls look the same

Ya i got with her but i don't know her name
I'm not gonna call her i can give you her aim
But the crazy bitch only wants me for my fame
I wanna party let's get drunk
I'm gonna grab another cup

And let's smoke another blunt
We ain't stoppin never stoppin
I wanna party let's get drunk
I'm gonna grab another cup
And let's smoke another blunt

We ain't stoppin til the sun comes up
Tonight i wanna make some mistakes
Consume a lot of drinks and get shitfaced
Wanna meet alot of girls
Spit a little game

Pop bottles with the models and drink pink chamagne
I'm parked out front
Gettin brain in a range
My night life might seem so strange
But this is what i do
Who the fuck are you?

I'm not askin cause i'm mad
I'm askin cause youre cute
I wanna party let's get drunk
I'm gonna grab another cup
And let's smoke another blunt

We ain't stoppin never stoppin
I wanna party let's get drunk
I'm gonna grab another cup
And let's smoke another blunt
We ain't stoppin til the sun comes up
