CAN'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF ME

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
They say hindsights 20/20
But your eyes are always stunning
It's a tragedy, I'm a casualty
Cause you fell in love with me
(in love with me)

Hurt before some years, you just had to get me
Everytime I went out my past wouldnt let me
Called me 4 times, a couple more times
Your body is off the hook, so is my phone line
I wouldnt act distant if you werent persistant
On bein crazy bitch thats why I'm actin diffrent
Run and tell all your friends I'm a dickhead
And then tell every girl in the world how good
The sex is

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
They say hindsights 20/20
But your eyes are always stunning
It's a tragedy, I'm a casualty
Cause you fell in love with me
(in love with me)

You can't take your eyes of me [x2]

You got everything you wannna
But you can't have me too,too

You can't take your eyes of me [x2]

You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too too too

Dispite your best intentions,they were your worst mistakes
Girl you eat attention in the worst ways
You thristy and no I wont stay another minute
How you'd think I wouldnt end it
You aint got an once of confidence in you
And I dont have the time to begin to explain
Everythings thats on my brain
Cause it's obvious you aint gonna change

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
They say hindsights 20/20
But your eyes are always stunning
It's a tragedy, im a casualty
Cause you fell in love with me
(in love with me)

You can't take your eyes of me [x2]

You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too,too

You can't take your eyes of me [x2]

You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too too too

You've gone of the deep end [x4]

You can't take your eyes of me [x2]

You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too,too

You can't take your eyes of me [x2]

You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too too too
