OH JUST LIKE ME

I've been moving like i never learned how to stop
The stickiest,eyes glued,intrigued to watch
I've been hearing things,actually shit alot
How come the pretty people speak that ugly talk

Feelin me now, tryin to figure me out
My secrets stay where i stay as well
Dont tell, gotta keep the mystery
But they want every piece they can get from me

Im alone on my own
Gotta seize my shit
And tell your friends to get off my dick
New money, young kid and they copycat the favorite

Forget how i feel for right now
You always have a way to find things out
It's hard as i try to keep it low
You bring it up again (up again)

You dont care, oh just like me
Dont go there, oh just like me
You can't do what i can do
You want to be oh just like me
Got secrets too, oh just like me
Creepin up on you, oh just like me
You can't do what i can do
You want to be oh just like me

Nothings free but if its for me
Then it dont apply, im a rule changey
Get my weed from her or she
Bring it over delivery
What's the deal with these copycats
Wash your mouth, landrymats
Like stains tryin to be stuck to me
But im too damn sharp, cutlery

One of a kind and ahead of my time
Miss that shit, make you hit rewind
Tough to shine when your stuck behind
Cause i ate you up now im down with nine

Im sick inside from the way i drive
To the way i write, to the way i type
To the way i fly and get high, i get high
Forget how i feel for right now
You always have a way to find things out
It's hard as i try to keep it low
You bring it up again (up again)
You dont care, oh just like me
Dont go there, oh just like me
You can't do what i can do
You want to be oh just like me
Got secrets too, oh just like me
Creepin up on you, oh just like me
You can't do what i can do
You want to be oh just like me

Oh just like me

Forget how i feel for right now
You always have a way to find things out
It's hard as i try to keep it low
You bring it up again (up again)
You dont care, oh just like me
Dont go there, oh just like me
You can't do what i can do
You want to be oh just like me
Got secrets too, oh just like me
Creepin up on you, oh just like me
You can't do what i can do
You want to be oh just like me
