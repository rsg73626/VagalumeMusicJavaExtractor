LEAVING

LEAVING

T-on

[Intro]
Yeah... Between Love and hate… I gotta do that and I need ya understand… Let’s go!

[Hook]
Boy I don’t wanna see,
I can’t watch ya leave.
Don’t you have pity of me?
Without ya I can’t live.

[Verso 1 – T-on]
Girl you don’t know I’m sick,
Since then that shit happened.
I acted just like a weak,
Trusted in bitches thought with dick.
I think it’s no good we go on doin’ that,
I tried I a lot, it’s enough I gotta rest.
Fuck off the choice that I made, my mind is done,
Fuck off the hoes that I got, the past is gone.
Everybody err but I know how to recognize,
If I did that was ‘cause our love affair wasn’t right.
My conscience is heavy but I can overcome,
If I told I’m leavin’ is because I won’t come.
Don’t doubt me it’s hard but I gotta do,
You even can forgive me, but still I love you.
That’s the best way we can lead to resolve it,
I ain’t the man you need to get happy. You don’t deserve it.
I can’t stay with you anymore ‘cause the blame is killin’ me,
We gon’ be better far away. For that reason I’m leavin’ here.

[Chorus]
Boy please I won’t resist,

You’re strong, you can take it.

Boy, stop to hurt me,

Baby you don’t deserve it.

But boy I want you stay,

No, that’s the best way.

Without you I gon’ die,

Before that than lies.

[Verse 2]
Only God can change my mind,
I don’t want worry about you,
The things that I felt like,
When I do gon’ be alright.
I think I ain’t the kind that just want only a women,
I’d like to wake up with a different every morning.
Look girl, you too good for me,
But I think the man you’re looking for I won’t be.
I can’t keep like this ‘cause my destiny is live alone,
You can’t change me ‘cause I’m used to be wrong.
I believe in ya faith but God is fair,
And nobody can love if the love has no glare.
Girl I’m leaving ‘cause I can’t live with treason,
Pretend everyday I’m good, But I’ll be jailed in a prison.
Do you need another reason? Our lives would become a hell,
If I’d kissed others I’d never kiss ya mouth.
Girl you holy for me and I don’t wanna see ya crying,
We can’t live together or inside me I’ll be dying.

[Chorus]
Boy please I won’t resist,

You’re strong, you can take it.

Boy, stop to hurt me,

Baby you don’t deserve it.

But boy I want you stay,

No, that’s the best way.

Without you I gon’ die,

Before that than lies.
