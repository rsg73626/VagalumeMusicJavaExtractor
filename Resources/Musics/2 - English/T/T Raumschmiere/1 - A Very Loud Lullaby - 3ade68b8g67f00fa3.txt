A VERY LOUD LULLABY

Was it me or was it you
Who turned the light out in the room
I never know how to relax
We should get over to the sex
I have to i have to
I have to get it on
I have to put the same adrenaline on everyone
You have to you have to
You have to get it on
You have to put the same adrenaline on everyone
Come turn around and just watch what i do

I`m dreaming away
All of the pain
And shut the pain
...
So don`t you ever hold me back

I`m dreaming away
All of the pain
We shut the pain
We are dreaming away
All of the pain
And shut the pain
But it won`t be the same
All of the pain
Yes i shot the pain

Love is all you can
Love is all you can do
Don`t you understand what is the masterplan beyond you
It`s your lust and pain it`s just your lust and pain i`m into
One step closer and you can`t go back
It is good it`s o.k. if the pain is trapped
Love is all you can
Love is all you can proove
