THE GLAMOROUS LIFE

(Feat. Inaya Day)

She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind

She's got big thoughts, big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
Word about this girl
She really wants
Is to be in love with a man

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love
It ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie
She threw him bread and said make me scream
In the dark what could he say

Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said, I need a man's man, baby
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love
It ain't much

Oh oh oh

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 secret street
They made love and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem
She thought real love is real scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever
That's all your life
Love is heaven sent
It's glamorous

Lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love
It ain't much
It ain't much
