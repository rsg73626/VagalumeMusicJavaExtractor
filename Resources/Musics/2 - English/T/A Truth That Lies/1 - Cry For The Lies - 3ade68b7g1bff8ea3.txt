CRY FOR THE LIES

Of blood frozen so thick
my heart is painted black
its bleeding in tears now
make me cry for you
hurt me just this once
honesty straight tell me 
even if truth kills

darling sincerely burn it
they wont come running
but i'll grab it
i'll cry for the lies

turn back the clock
falling with your lies
but i'll bleed just to rise 
i dont feel alive 
against your strive
for the lies again
to be alive
