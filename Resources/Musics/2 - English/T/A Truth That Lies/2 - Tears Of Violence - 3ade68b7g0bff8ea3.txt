TEARS OF VIOLENCE

seperated from skin.
flesh and bones splits.
we've been distroyed.
dead by dawn im not willing.
to die as poetic.
i won't stop crying.
painful shed tears.
vengeance will come upon their death.

in front of your own eyes.
i shall rise with all this blood.

i kept in so long to be thrown.
silence upon the weakness.
hatred upon death.
it won't be broken or stolen by time.
