REBORN

We're not in the top, yet
But it's not time to stop trying, no

The biggest proof of failure is giving up
It's not time to stop trying, no
The biggest proof of failure is giving up
It's not time to stop trying, no

The night's dark, restless
It desires to see our complete failure
Now is the time this chronicle, our fame
We say rules, make our own destiny

We're not in the top, yet
But it's not time to stop trying, no

The biggest proof of failure is giving up
It's not time to stop trying, no
The biggest proof of failure is giving up
It's not time to stop trying, no

The night's dark, restless
It desires to see our complete failure
Now is the time this chronicle, our fame
We say rules, make our own destiny

We're our scream
We're our voice

Choose life not just for exist
Feel the power, control your deeds
Control the results
Become your own God
