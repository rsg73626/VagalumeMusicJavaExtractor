BREATHE (FEAT. LIL WAYNE)

Like it, protest it, watch out
1,2,3,4, It's like a real life bouncer coming to life
I can see the animal when I look inside
He wants me, the only thing that satisfies the piece
He hungers just for me, it's everywhere I'm gonna be

I'm always,he's always watching
It's like he can't get enough, my love is a job
I'm always,he's always watching
It's like he can't get enough, my love is a job

Breathe,, must get down, 
Get down from there it's like you're always, 
Cause boy you're driving me crazy
Breathe, your love is too much, you killin' me baby

It's like I, cause you're always there,, be like a shadow
And to me that ain't fair
You got what you want and you know what I need
So just tease, and let me breathe

I'm always,he's always watching
It's like he can't get enough, my love is a job
I'm always,he's always watching
It's like he can't get enough, my love is a job

Breathe,, must get down, get down from there 
It's like you're always, cause boy you're driving me crazy
Breathe, your love is too much, you killin' me baby
I can't breathe

I can leave it till tomorrow,tell your boyfriend sayonara,, I'm a dinosaur,, sheets, in my bed, when I, between her legs,
Between her legs
Now she sleepin', I can't breathe,, get away,
I can't breathe, get away, get away

Breathe,, must get down, get down from there 
It's like you're always, cause boy you're driving me crazy
Breathe, your love is too much, you killin' me baby
I can't breathe, just breathe
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe, just breathe
I'm addicted baby.
