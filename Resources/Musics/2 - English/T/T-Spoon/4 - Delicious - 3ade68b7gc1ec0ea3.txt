DELICIOUS

You're So Delicious
Sometimes You're Vicous
I Just Can't Get You Out Of My Mind
You Drive Me Crazy
And You Amaze Me
I Am Thinking Of You All The Time

I Wanna Be Your Lover
Don't Wanna Be Your Bitch
I Wanna Make You Horny
I Can Turn Your Switch

You're Delicious
You're So Delicous

Sometimes I'm Wicked
When We Kick It
I Just Can't Get Enough Of Your Love
You've Gotta Have It
You Silly Rabbit
Cause I Know What You're Dreaming Of

I Wanna Be Your Lover
Don't Wanna Be Your Bitch
I Wanna Make You Horny
I Can Turn Your Switch

You're Delicious
You're So Delicous

I Got Shorty Swinging In My Way
Shaking That Booty In A Fly Way
Take Her To The Crib With Some Alazy
We Can Fly Or You Can Hit The Highway
From The D To The E To The-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
Oh Yes Girl You're The Best
You've Got The Key To Get In To Room
All I Wanna Do Is Zoome Zoom Zoom Zoom

I Wanna Be Your Lover
Don't Wanna Be Your Bitch
I Wanna Make You Horny
I Can Turn Your Switch

You're Delicious
