HELLO KITTY!

Rap: 
Here Kitty Kitty Kitty, Where The Funk Is That Cat? 
There You Are Feline Charm, Sauntering Through The Hood 
Seeking To Disarm A Wayward Tom With Wily Wit And Chat 
Another Mouse In A Trap Of My Kitty Cat 
But You're Oh So Much More Than A Kitty 4x 
Rap: 
Could It Be The Way You're Smiling Over Me 
Can It Be The Laughter In Your Eyes 
I Grew So Fast But I've Never Gotten Over You 
I Know You Are The Saviour In My Life 
Cause You're Oh So Much More Than A Kitty 4x 



Chorus: 
All I Need, Is All I Want 
All I Want, Is All I Need 
All I Need, Is All I Want Is Understanding 

Rap: 
To Touch, To Taste, To Hear, To See, To Hear 
To Have, To Hold, To Lose Control 
To Love, To Hate, To Fear, To Be, To Live, To Die 
To Say Goodbye 

Chorus 

Rap: 
I'm Gonna Teach You A Lesson One You Shan't Forget 
How To Forbear Pleasure In Mine Absence 
I Am Devine, So Shall You Be Exhalted By All My Little Kitty
