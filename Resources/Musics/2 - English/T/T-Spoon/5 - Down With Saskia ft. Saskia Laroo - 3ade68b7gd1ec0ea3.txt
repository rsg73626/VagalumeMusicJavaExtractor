DOWN WITH SASKIA FT. SASKIA LAROO

Vocals: 
I'm Feeling Down 
And In My Mind I See You Lying On The Ground 
Is This Profound 
I Know There Ain't No Love Inside Your Head 
Memories Of You Are Dead 
I'm Feeling Down 
Rap: 
Down Dressed In Black With A Silver Clip 
What's Up With This Strange Relationship 
I Don't Know Star Are We Going Far 
On Tippy Tippy Toes Show Me One Of Those 
What Do You Propose Stay Or Let It Roll 
Anything We Start Girl, You Know We Gotta Finish 
Or Suffer The Consequences Yeah 

Vocals: 
Resurrect For Me If You Can 
Our Lovely Two Night Stand 
It's Not Enough I Suffer Your Crush 
Ain't No Love Inside Your Head 
Memories Of Me Are Dead
