A PART OF MY LIFE

A Part Of My Life 2x

Chorus:
A Part Of My Life Is Wonderfull, I Can See 
A Part Of My Life So Magical, You & Me 
The Sun Is Always Shining 
Love Is Everywhere 
Can You Feel The Dream 
A Part Of My Life, You & Me

Rap: 
So, Here We Are, Looking For That Shiny Star 
Up Above, Down Below 
You Tell Me Where I Should Know 
Will I Run, Try To Hide 
Love Is My Last Alibi 
Time, Twist, So I Turn 
Tell Me Now, For You I'll Burn 
Maybe You Must Take The Dream 
Of One Who Lived Too Many Things 
My Thoughts, My Thoughts Are Not Of You 
How Can I Make You See Through 
Tell Me Do You Really Wanna Be 
A Truly Deeper Part Of Me, Part Of Me, Part Of Me

Chorus: 
A Part Of My Life Is Wonderfull, I Can See 
A Part Of My Life So Magical, You & Me 
The Sun Is Always Shining 
Love Is Everywhere 
Can You Feel The Dream 
A Part Of My Life, You & Me
A Part Of My Life 2x

Rap: 
1 Little, 2 Little, 3 Little Girls 
All Enough To Rock My World 
If You See Me Chasing Skirts 
Slap Me 'Till My Feelings Hurt 
Tell Me Do You Really Wanna Be 
A Truly Deeper Part Of Me, Part Of Me, Part Of Me

Chorus:
A Part Of My Life Is Wonderfull, I Can See 
A Part Of My Life So Magical, You & Me 
The Sun Is Always Shining 
Love Is Everywhere 
Can You Feel The Dream 
A Part Of My Life, You & Me
A Part Of My Life 4x
