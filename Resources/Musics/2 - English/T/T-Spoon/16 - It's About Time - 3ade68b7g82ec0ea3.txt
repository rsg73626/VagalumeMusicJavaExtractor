IT'S ABOUT TIME

Rap: 
I'm Here Once Again 
Feel The Truth That Flows Within 
We Were Lovers Long Ago 
This Is Something You Should Know 
Read It See It In The Stars 
I'm Exactly Who You Are 
Breath It Out, Breath It In 
Time Time And Again 
Vocals: 
As I Close My Eyes I Can See You In A Way 
Like A Blazing Star Turning Night Into The Day 
And The Feeling Is Right 
Holding You Tight, I Need You 
When The Loving Is Strong 
Nothing Is Wrong 
Believe 

Chorus:
It's About Time We Are Living 
Tell Me What You're Giving 
I Know, Baby Baby 
Tell Me That You Love Me 
You're Thinking Of Me 
I Know, Baby 
It's About Time 4x 

Vocals: 
Now Perhaps My Love Could Somehow Bring You Down 
And I Can See Why You Don't Want Me Around 
But I Know What You Want 
Know What You Need, Believe Me 
When The Loving Is Strong 
Nothing Is Wrong 
You And Me 

Chorus: 
It's About Time We R Living 
Tell Me What You're Giving 
I Know, Baby Baby 
Tell Me That U Love Me 
You're Thinking Of Me 
I Know, Baby 
It's About Time 4x 
It's About Time 

Rap: 
I'm Here Once Again 
Feel The Truth That Flows Within 
We Were Lovers Long Ago 
This Is Something U Should Know 
Read It See It In The Stars 
I'm Exactly Who You Are 
Breath It Out, Breath It In 
Time Time And Again 

Bridge: 
Time Keeps Ticking, Time Keeps Ticking 
No Matter What You Think, I Still Love You 
Time Keeps Ticking, Time Keeps Ticking 
So Tell Me Now What Are You Gonna Do 

Repeat Chorus 2x
