RAIN IN JUNE

Dark Voice: 
If This Could Be 
Then Who Is He 
And Who Am I 
Darkness 

Rap: 
Keekaboo, Keekaboo, Don't Let Nobody See You 
Every Little Kitty Gonna Give You Something New 
Hands In The Air, Show Me You Care 
Loved Your Flair, So I'll Be There 
What You Wanna Do, What You Wanna Do, What You Wanna Do 
Open Up Your Eyes, Gonna Play Peekaboo 


Dark Voice: 
T-Spoon... 
Capacity Unknown 
I Said 
Sham Rock 

Rap: 
Peace To Yo I Don't Wanna Let It Go 
But I Gotta Let It Go Cause You Know I Gotta Show 
Old To The New Better Yet Another School 
And I'm Gonna Get It Back With My Profalactactics 
Are The Key If You Wanna Know I See 
What Is He When You Be All Up In The Land Of Cream 
And Honey I Wanna Break It To You Sunny It's Funny 
I Work Hard For The Money 

Dark Voice: 
Righteous Water Flows 
Inhale 
Linda Estelle 

Chorus: 
Oh, What About Me, Oh, What About Me 
I Like Rain In June, Tomorrow Ain't To Soon 
When You Walk Away, Baby I Won't Say 
I Like Rain In June, Tomorrow Ain't To Soon 
When You Walk Away Baby I Won't Say 
Baby I Won't Say, Baby I Won't Say 


She's Floating On A Lexicon Of Life 
Looking For Her Baby 

Rap: 
Can't Understand Why the Rock Don't Stop 
And The People On the Block Say All On My Jock 
Hey I Want You Oh I Told You 
I'm The Type Of Man That You Have To Grab Ahold 
String Me Along With A Rap And A Song 
If I'm Up Then I'm Gone Gotta Find My Way Home 
Turn Me In Turn Me Baby Don't You Burn 
Ease Your Mind Still I Yearn 

Chorus 


She's Floating On A Lexicon Of Life 
Looking For Her Baby 

You Tell Me, Lean, Lean On Me 
You Tell Me, Lean, Lean On Me 
Baby I Won't Say 
Baby I Won't Say
