FLY AWAY [SINGLE VERSION]

Standing Far Away From Home 
Walking Through The Message On The Phone 
This Is... More Than Love

Chorus: 
Fly Away 
Tell Me That You Want Me Here To Stay 
One Day I Will Be A Sunday 
Fly Away 
Take My Hand We'll Never Say Goodbye 
I Can See The Future In Your Eye

Standing Far Away From Home 
Walking Through The Message On The Phone 
This Is... More Than Love 
Still I Often Wonder Why 
Teardrops Keep On Falling From Sky 
This Is... More Than Love

How Many Lovers Have You Seen 
Could You Be Another One Like Me 
In A Fantasy 
I Know Why I Run From You 
Passion Takes Me When The Night Turns Blue 
In A Fantasy Just You And Me

Chorus

Drifting In A Lonely Land 
Promise Of A Woman And A Man 
This Is... More Than Love

Chorus
