IN LOVING MEMORY

I Travel To Your Gravesite
Lay Flowers Down The Care
No One Knows My Heartache
When I Go I Leave You There

Verse:
Pictures On The Wall Of The Times When We We're Small
I Think Of You Every Day
Precious Memories Left Behind Are Forever In My Mind
I Miss You More Than Words Can Say

Climb:
I Miss You, I Need You
You'll Always Be On My Mind
Oceans Of Sadness That's All You're Leaving Behind

Chorus:
In Loving Memory You Will Always Be
A Part Of Me Inside
In Loving Memory It Just Had To Be
I Pray For You Each Night

Verse:
Wish I Had One More Day, There's So Much I Wanna Say
It All Happened So Fast
On My Face A Silent Tear, How I Wish That You Were Here
But I Can't Change The Past

Climb

Chorus

No More Tomorrows For Us To Share
Yesterdays Memories Will Always Be There
You Gave Me All You Had To Give, Gifts Both Great And Small
But Most Of All You Gave Me Love, The Greatest Gift Of All

Climb

Chorus

I Speak Your Name With Love And Pride
My Tears Of Sadness I Can Not Hide
If Love Could Have Saved You, You Would Have Never Ever Died...
