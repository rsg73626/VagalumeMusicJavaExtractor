LOUISE

A Side From Me Is No One
Within Me Is Every You
Searching The Depths Of My Being For The Girl In Black
The Girl In Black

Louise

She Walks Her Grey Path
Shroded By The Folds Of Night Chilling All The
Taunters Dismissing The Fright Next To Her I Seem
Little A Lost Fragment Of Wind Tonight We Open
Hoping To Transcend

Louise

Yes I Know It Sounds Ludicrous
And Somewhat Banal
But I Shiver When She Moves
Like Shadows On The Wall
Indecision Moves Me To A Slower Stately Crawl
I Shiver When She Moves
Like Shadows On The Wall

Louise

Ok Ok Ok, So I'm Not Really Who I Am
Inside It's Confusing Cause She Don't Give A Damn
The Thorn In MY Heart Is The Gleam In Her Eye
Darling My Boots Are Fading Saying Goodbye

Louise

Tonight We Dance Shaking Our Fist
At The Sounds Of Reality
hear Me SHout Hold Me Hold Me

Louise

I Dream Of You Loving With Me
Chasing Away My Misery (4x)

But All Dreams Must Come To An End Awake
This Close To Satisfaction
I Could Taste Your Reaction
Maybe If I Stumble You Will Catch My Disease
