COME AND GET MY LOVE

Rap:
I Would Die, I Would Lie For You
Move Mountains If You Want Me To
I Will Pull The Sun Right Out Of The Sky - Let's Take It Nice And Slow
I Would Lie For You And That's The Truth
I Never Ever Want To Make You Blue
I'll Show You Heaven In My Arms - Is It Really You 

Rap:
You're Every Wish I'll Make Come True
It Might Be Crazy, Crazy For You
When I Touch You And Make You Feel Good
Make Love To You Like Cassanova Would
I Don't Want You For A One Night Stand
My Whole Life With You I Wanna Spend
The Way I Feel For You Words Can Not Express
You Fill Me Up With Happiness

Chorus:
Come And Get My Love
Don't Turn Around
I Will Never Let You Down
Come And Get My Love
Don't Waste Your Time - Your Magical, So Sensual, Emotional, So Beautiful
Come And Get My Love
And You Will See You Mean Everything To Me
All That I Wanna Do Is Make Your Dreams Come True - Is It Really You

Rap:
Without You There Is No Me
You're My Honey And I'm You're Be
Let Me Show You I'm You're Loverman
The One That You Can Trust The One You Know Who'll Be Fair - Let's Take It Nice And Slow
I'm Applying For A License To Thrill
Your Every Wish I Will Fulfill
You're The Queen Of Ultimate Correct
I'm Your King With Ultimate Respect

Chorus

Rap:
I'll Do Anything You Ask Me To
Even Sell My Soul For You - Always Thinking About You
I Want You To Be Around
Never Ever Let You Down - There's No Living Without You
Tell Me That You'll Never Go
Wanna Take It Nice And Slow - We'll Be Happy Together
You're Magical, So Sensual, Emotional, So Beautiful
That's The Way That You Are

Repeat Verse 1

Chorus

Break by Linda:
Do You Really Want Me? - Our Love Can't Wait, So Don't Hesitate Tonight
Can We Take It Nice And Slow? - You Make Me Believe That You Are The Thief Of My Heart
How Can I Believe In You? - You Make Me Survive, You've Changed All My Life For Real
What Am I Supposed To Do? - I Wanna Be Near You Every Day
Tell Me This Is For Real

Chorus
