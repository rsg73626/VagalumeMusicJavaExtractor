MERRY CHRISTMAS

SHAMROCK
Word Up Kids! How are you doing?
Now Uncle Shammy's In The House
Gather Around The Tree
I Wanna Tell You A Story
SHAMROCK
Ho Ho Ho Here We Go, Let It Snow
I'm Kissing With A Girl Yeah Underneath The Mistletoe
She Is Not A Barbie Girl, But I Really Like Her Dude
Ho Ho Ho Here We Go

SHAMROCK
I Was Walking In The Street All Alone Late In The Night On Christmas Eve
When I Girl Came Up Beside Me, Placed Her Hand In Mine And Smiled At Me
And She Said:

LINDA
The Feeling Is Right
I'm In The Mood Tonight
Let's Have A Party
The Christmas Bells Are Ringing
Carollers Are Singing
Hallelujah! Sing Hallelujah!

CHORUS:
Everybody Merry Christmas!
Everybody Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas And A Happy New Year!

SHAMROCK
I Wanna Tell You All The Secrets That I Keep Deep Inside
There Is No Other Girl For Me She Turned And Looked Into My Eyes
She Said

LINDA
The Feeling Is Right
I'm In The Mood Tonight
Let's Have A Party
Jingle Bells Are Ringing
The Children Keep On Singing
Hallelujah! Sing Hallelujah!

CHORUS

SHAMROCK
Ho Ho Ho Here We Go, Let It Snow
I'm Kissing With A Girl Yeah Underneath The Mistletoe
She Is Not A Barbie Girl, But I Really Like Her Dude
Put Me In A Box, Tell Me What You Wanna Do
Anyway You Want It, You Just Flaunt It
If You Got A Good Thing Get Down On It
Christmas Time, Gonna Have Much Chear
Merry Christmas And A Happy New Year!
