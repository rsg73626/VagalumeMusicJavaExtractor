SEE THE LIGHT FT. JOHNNY KELVIN

Shamrock:
Joy... Life... Pain...
Red... Green... Blue...
I'll Take You...

Verse 1 (by Shamrock):
Woke Up In The Morning, You Were Next To Me
Saw You Like A Dream, You Were Fading
I've Never Said The Words Altough My Heart Was True
I Looked Into The Mirror, It Was You

Chorus (by Johnny Kelvin):
Going Through The Tunnel, Can You See The Light
Can You See The Light, Can You See The Light
Knowing Something's Better On The Other Side
Makes You Feel Alright, Makes You Feel Alright - Feel Alright

Verse 2 (by Shamrock):
Going Through The Tunnel, Can You See The Light
Wishing On Tomorrow, Let It Shine So Bright
Come On Baby, Let Me Take You There
Living In The Shadow Of A Love That Isn't There

Chorus

Shamrock:
Joy... Life... Pain...
Red... Green... Blue...
I'll Take You...

Bridge (by Linda Estelle):
Going Through The Tunnel
I Can See The Light
Now There's Someone Waiting
On The Other Side
Never Mind Your Sorrow
Take Away The Fear
Send Me To Tomorrow
Take Me Away From Here

Chorus

Makes You Feel Alright

Can You See The Light, Can You See The Light

Makes You Feel Alright, Makes You Feel Alright - Makes You Feel Alright
