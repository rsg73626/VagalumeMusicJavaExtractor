HIGHER HIGHER

Vocal: 
In The Dawn She Came And Took Away My Pain 
Now That I've Felt Your Touch I'll Never Be The Same 
Chorus: 
Come Together One And All 
See The Future Standing Tall 
Peace And Happiness For All 
Higher, Higher 
When You Are Feeling Down 
I Will Lift You Off The Ground 
If You're Lost You Will Be Found 
Higher, Higher 

Vocals: 
Today I Turned On The TV-Set 
And Everything Was Wrong 
Because A Man With A Silver Face Was Deviding Everyone 
He Said That I Am The Future 
So Forget About The Past 
I Saw It In Your Eyes 
You Don't Walk The Path 

Climb:
I'll Show You How To Get There 
I'll Show You How To Get There 
I'll Show You How To Get There 
I'll Show You How To Get There 

Chorus 


Rap: 
In The Dawn She Came And Took Away My Pain 
Now That I've Felt Your Touch I'll Never Be The Same 

Vocal: 
It's Not A Dream That I'm Living 
It's Something You Should Know 
You Have To Follow The Path Of Life To A Place Where U Can Grow 
I'll Show You How To Get There, Follow Me 
Come Along And You Will See 
This Is The Way To A Better Life 
Where Everyone Is Free 

Climb:
I'll Show You How To Get There 
I'll Show You How To Get There 
I'll Show You How To Get There 
I'll Show You How To Get There 

Chorus 

Come Together One And All...
And See The Future Standing Tall...
When You Are Feeling Down I Will Lift You Of The Ground
If You're Lost You Will Be Found
Higher, Higher
