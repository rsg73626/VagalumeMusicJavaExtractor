I'LL BE MISSING YOU

I've Been Missing You, Oh Baby
I Need You By My Side

Verse Greg:
I Believe In You
Our Love Is True
How Could I Forget The Day That Our Love Began
I Just Heard The Bell
Got Me Out Of Hell
I Don't Wanna Be Left Alone In The Dark Again

Chorus:
I've Been Missing You Again
And I Wish You'd Feel The Same
I'll Do Anything To Make Our Love Come True
I've Been Missing You Again (I Have Been Missing You)
Never Try To Play Again
I Want You To Know That I'll Be There For You (Found A Love So True)

Verse Greg:
There's A Change Of Heart
For A Brandnew Start
Let Them Say I'm A Hopeless Fool To Act This Way
My Love For You Is Fine
And You're One Of A Kind
You're So Far Away But I Dream Of You Every Day

Chorus:
I've Been Missing You Again
And I Wish You'd Feel The Same
I'll Do Anything To Make Our Love Come True
I've Been Missing You Again (I Have Been Missing You)
Never Try To Play Again
I Want You To Know That I'll Be There For You

Break:
Missing You
Feel The Same
Missing You Again

Verse Linda:
I've Been Missing You
Make My Dreams Come True
There Is No One Like Me, Love You Endlessly, Yes I Do
Wish You'd Feel The Same
When I Call Your Name
I'll Be There For You, Whatever You Do, Play No Game

Chorus:
I've Been Missing You Again - I've Been Missing You
And I Wish You'd Feel The Same - I Wish You'd Feel The Same
I'll Do Anything To Make Our Love Come True - Make My Dreams Come True
I've Been Missing You Again - I've Been Missing You
Never Try To Play Again - Make My Dreams Come True
I Want You To Know That I'll Be There For You - I'll Be There For You

I've Been Missing You Again - I Have Been Missing You
Never Try To Play Again
I Want You To Know That I'll Be There For You
