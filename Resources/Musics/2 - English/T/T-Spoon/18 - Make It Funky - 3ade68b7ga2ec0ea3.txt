MAKE IT FUNKY

Make It Funky Tonight
Move Your Body, Let's Party And Dance The Night Away
Make It Funky Tonight
Move Your Body, Let's Party And Dance The Night Away
Make It Funky!
Make It Funky!

Rap:
Now I've Got Your Attention
I Got To Let You Know, Got To Mention
I've Got Something For All, Yeah All
Check It, Now Get The Flowers Of The Wall
And Don't Be Ashame, Cause Is Party Your Name
To G Sixteen And I Said Know My Claim
In The Name Of The Bomb That I'm Dropping
To Keep My Party Rocking

Rap:
Can I get A Hey? - Hey
Can I Get A Hoo - Hooo!!
Knock Knock, There We Go On The Backdoor
Looking For The Freakshow, It's Right Hear Yo
And I'm The One To Serve Up The Big Fun
And Won't Stop Till It's Done
To All My Peeps In The Place To Be
Let's Make It Funky

Chorus
Make It Funky Tonight
Move Your Body, Let's Party And Dance The Night Away
Make It Funky Tonight
Move Your Body, Let's Party And Dance The Night Away
We Feel So Strong, Dance All Night Long
With The Peeps In The Streets
We Feel So Strong, Dance All Night Long
With The Peeps In The Streets

Rap:
Like Janet We Go Deep Baby Real Deep
And It's A Fact That You Will Get No Sleep
From Detroit To The West And Back To The Eastcoast
I'm Gonna Make Sure You're Gonna Get The Utmost
Ain't Nothing But A Barman's Good Time
Huh, Guaranteed To Blow Your Mind
Won't Hurt Unless You Can't Dance
And If You Can't Dance Then You Won't Stand A Chance

Rap:
I'm Like A Boat With A Whole That's Sinking
And The Funk That I Brink Is Stinking
My Brother Billy D. Said To Me
"You'd Better Take Some Rimes To Make It Real Funky"
I Took The F, To The U, To The N, K, Y
And It's Me Coming Through
Yeah You Know Me As The G And Make It Funky

Chorus

Nananana Nananana Nananananana
Nananana Nananana Nananananana
Nananana Nananana Nananananana
Nananana Nananana Nananananana

Rap:
Knock Knock, There We Go On The Backdoor
Looking For The Freakshow, It's Right Hear Yo
Can I get A Hey? - Hey!!
Can I Get A Ho? - Nooo!!
And I'm The One To Serve Up The Big Fun
And Won't Stop Till It's Done
To All My Peeps In The Place To Be
Let's Make It Funky

Nananana - Make It Funky!
Nananana - Make It Funky Tonight!
Nananana - Yeah Make It Funky!
Nananana - Let's Dance The Night Away!

Chorus
