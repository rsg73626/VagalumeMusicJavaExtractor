OPEN UP 2 U FT. BLONDE

Loving YoIs Never Now
I Feel So Helpless
Open As A Child If You Could See Me
In Your Mind Would You Concede
One Day Being Mine

Chorus:
You Can Give It To Me
Get Me In The Mood
Need A Little Satisfaction
Open Up 2 U
Don't You Keep Me Waiting
Love Me Like You Do
Need A Little Satisfaction
Open Up 2 U

So You Tell Me To Understand
Am I The One
Is He The Other One
Now You're Saying We Are Done
And I Realize
I'm Not The Only One

Chorus

Over And Over She Let Down
Took Your Love And Left The Town
Went Away Went A Way On A Wedding Day
Bended Knee But She Would Not Stay
Now You're Hanging Out In The Wind
Love Is Lost On A One Time Friend
It Was Easy When You Begun
