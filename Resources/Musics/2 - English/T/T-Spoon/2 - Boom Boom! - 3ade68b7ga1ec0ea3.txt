Rap:
Breaking Balls, Banging Walls, Living Out My Dreams
Ripping Up My Jeans, Build Up Steam With Wipped Cream
I Like To Run My Hands Up And Down Her Legs
I Love It When She Glares (Go Ahead Daddy...)
The Way She's Dressed, She Looks So Fine
I'll Make Her Wet, I'll Make Her Mine
Breaking Balls, Banging Walls, All Of This Is True
Girl Tell Me What You Wanna Do...

Climb:
I Wanna Freak You Up, Wanna Freak You Down (Ooooh...)
I Wanna Sex You Up To A Higher Ground (Ooooh...)

Chorus:
Say It To Me - Do Wah Diddy Do Wah
You Are The One, I Wanna Have Some Fun
Oh Can't You See - Do Wah Diddy Wa Boom
I Show You Love, So Let's Go Up To My Room

Boom Boom Boom Boom!! - I Can Not Get Enough
Boom Boom Boom Boom!! - And I Say Oh.. Oh..
Boom Boom Boom Boom!! - Can Not Get Enough Of Your Love
Woh Oh Oh, Woh Oh Oh!

Rap:
Wanna Dance, Wanna Sing, Girl I'll Do My Silly Things
Standing Tall, Looking Good, All Of Being Hollywood
I Must Confess I Like Talking Sex And Getting Undressed
Drinking Mai Tai In A Singapore Sling
Beam Me Up Jim, Yo It's Time To Come In
Build Up Steam With Wipped Cream, All Of This Is True
Girl Tell Me What You Wanna Do...

Climb
