F.O.O.T.B.A.L.L. (LAND OF FOOTBALL GLORY)

Land Of Football Glory
Mightier Than Thee
Score, Yes We Shall Do
And Claim Our Victory

Football! Football! Football!

Say It! - Football!
I Can't Hear You! - Football!
A Little Bit Louder - Football!
You Got To Kick That Ball - Football!

Got To Kick That Ball! - Football!
Wooh!

God, Who Made Us Mighty
Helps Us Do Our Best
God, Who Made Us Mighty
Shall Help Us Do Our Best
Come On Y'all We've Got To Kick That Ball!

Land Of Football Glory
Mightier Than Thee
Score, Yes We Shall Do
And Claim Our Victory

God, Who Made Us Mighty
Helps Us Do Our Best
God, Who Made Us Mighty
Shall Help Us Do Our Best
