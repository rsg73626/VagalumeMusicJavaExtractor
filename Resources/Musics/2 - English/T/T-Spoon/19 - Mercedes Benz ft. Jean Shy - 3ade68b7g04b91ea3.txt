MERCEDES BENZ FT. JEAN SHY

Chorus:
Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Mercedes Benz
My Friends All Drive Porsches
I Must Make A Mends
I Worked Hard All My Life Time
No Help From My Friends
Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Mercedes Benz

Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Color TV
Dialing For Dollars Is Trying To Find Me
I Wait For Delivery Each Day Until Three
Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Color TV

Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Night On The Town
I'm Counting On You Jesus
Please Don't Let Me Down
Prove That You Love Me
And Buy The Next Round
Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Night On The Town
Everybody

Chorus 3x

Rap:
It's Getting Kind A Hard
To Be The One Left Out
Every Time I Turn Around
My Friends Are Talking 'bout:
Porsches, TV, Lot's Of Cash, Money
They Looking On Me Tings
Like Me Being Some One Funny
I'm Just Another Face
But I'm Not Up In The Clouds
Flying First Class No Cash Not Allowed
Wish I Could Go Where The Cool Ones Go
Down To Mauritz Or Even San Paolo

Look At Me How Can It Be
I'm Living On My Own Broke As Hell
Or Can't You Tell I Can't Afford A Phone
I Work All Day For Little Pay
Somebody Make My Life
Take Me From The Misery, The Poverty And Strife
I'm Going Back Where I Began
Cause Love Is Kicking In
On My Knees I Beg Of You A Red Mercedes Benz
Little Retribution For The Dising Of My Friends
On My Knees I Beg Of You A Red Mercedes Benz
