HEAVEN IN MY HAND

Chorus by Linda:
Heaven In My Hand
Love Will Never End
What Can I Do To Prove My Love Is True
Don't Waste Any Time
Together We Will Find
The Promised Land
Heaven In My Hand

Verse Greg:
I Wish I Could Give The World To You
The Pretty Pictures Of What I Would Do
And I Can't Forget All The Things That You Said
Can't Get You Out Of My Head

Climb Greg:
I Should Have Known From The Very Start
You'd Take My Soul And You'd Take My Heart
Now I Know, Won't Let You Go

Chorus

Verse Greg:
I'm Feeling Your Heartbeat Next To Mine
Am I Mad Or Is It Just A Sign
Since I Met You I Just Go Insane
I Can't Find The Words To Explain

Climb Greg:
You Smile At Me Through A Thousand Tears
You Make Me Feel Good Without Any Fears
And I Know, Won't Let You Go

Chorus

Bridge Choir:
Everytime That I Close My Eyes
I Just Realise
I Want You Beside Me - Beside Me
Everytime That I Dream Of You
We Make Love So True
You Give Me Heaven In My Hand

You Give Me Heaven In My Hand

Climb Greg:
I Should Have Known From The Very Start
You'd Take My Soul And You'd Take My Heart
Now I Know, Won't Let You Go

Chorus

Bridge

Heaven In My Hand - Heaven In My Hand

Heaven In My Hand, Heaven In My Hand - What Can I Do
We Make Love So True - To Prove My Love Is True - So True
Heaven In My Hand - Love Will Never End
Love Will Never End
Heaven In My Hand, Heaven In My Hand - What Can I Do
We Make Love So True - To Prove My Love Is True - So True
