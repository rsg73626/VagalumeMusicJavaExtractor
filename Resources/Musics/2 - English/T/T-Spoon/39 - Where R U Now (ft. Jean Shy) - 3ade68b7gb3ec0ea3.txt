Where R U Now
Where R U Now Baby
Where R U Now
Where R U Now Yeah

Verse 1:
It's Three O'Clock In The Morning
I Realize I'm All Alone
We Never Thought You Would Leave Us
But It Ain't No Use Now You're Gone
Used To Sit And Wonder
If I Could Make It On My Own

Chorus:
Where R U Now
Where R U Now
Where R U Now Baby
Where R U Now
Where R U Now Yeah
Where R U Now
Where R U Now Baby
Where R U Now
Where R U Now Baby

Verse 2:
It's Funny Now That I'm Older
And Looking Back On Yesterday
I See My Life As A Blessing
On The Day You Came My Way
Baby I Will Love You
All Of My Life Till My Dying Day

Where R U Now
Where R U Now Baby
Where R U Now
Where R U Now Baby
Aaah Oh Yeah
Hmmm Yeah
Hey Hey Yeah

Rap:
I Tried I Tried But I Couldn't Live A Lie
Didn't Know What I Had Till It Walked On By
Days In The Past, Life Was A Blast
Go To Fast And You Wind Up Last
Rising Sun Could've Been Anyone
But I Lost My Life With The Shot Of A Gun
I Tried I Tried But I Couldn't Say Goodbye
Didn't Know What I Had Right Before My Eyes
So I See You My Dear Child... Where R U Now
