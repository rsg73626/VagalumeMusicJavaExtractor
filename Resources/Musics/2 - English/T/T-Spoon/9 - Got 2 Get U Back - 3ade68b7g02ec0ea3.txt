GOT 2 GET U BACK

The Scene Has Changed Now
It's A Different Show
You Left Me Without A Smile
It's Time To Go
This... Is The End Of The Show

Got 2 Get U Back!

Verse:
Act One - Our Story Begun
In Love And Had So Much Fun
Act Two - I See Through You
You Gotta Know This Means The End Of The Show

Climb:
What Am I Gonna Do With You?
Wasn't Our Dream A Dream For Two?
After All That You Put Me Through?
What Is The Truth, Don't Tell Me Lies
Am I A Devil In Disguise?
I Just Don't Trust In Your Lies!

Chorus:
Got 2 Get U Back - I Want You Back
In My Life - In My Life
Like A Maniac - A Maniac
Can't Survive - Can't Survive
I Want You Back Right By My Side
Every Day And Night
Got 2 Get U Back...

Got 2 Get U Back

Baby, I Told You Before
You Already Broke My Heart Once
And You Won't Break It Twice - Got 2 Get U Back!

Verse:
Act Three Was Jealousy
Since You've Been Gone, I Feel So Free
Act Four - You Still Want More
Don't Understand Forever This Is The End

Climb

Chorus

Bridge:
Got 2 Get U Back In My Life
Like A Maniac Can't Survive
I Want You Back Right By My Side
Every Day And Night
Got 2 Get U Back...

Got 2 Get U Back!

Climb

Bridge:
I Want You Back - In My Life
A Maniac - Can't Survive

Chorus
