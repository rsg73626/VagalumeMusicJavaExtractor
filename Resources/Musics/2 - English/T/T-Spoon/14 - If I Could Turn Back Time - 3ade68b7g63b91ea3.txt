IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME

Verse Linda:
If I Could Turn Back Time Again
I Would Be More Than Just A Friend
It Seems Like We're Meant To Be
I Wonder Where Is The Key?

Verse Greg:
You Are More Than Just A Friend
That's All That I Want You To Know
For You I'd Walk A Thousand Miles
Through Deserts And Mountainhigh Snow

Climb Linda:
Since The Day I Met You
I Just Know I Didn't Feel The Same
You're The One I Adore
Can't You Hear Me Calling Your Name

Chorus:
If I Could Turn Back Time - If I Could Turn Back Time Again
I Wish You Will Be Mine - I Would Be More Than Just A Friend
I Even Can't Describe - It Seems Like We're Meant To Be
What I Feel Deep Inside - I Wonder Where Is The Key?
If I Could Turn Back Time - If I Could Turn Back Time Again
There's Someone Always Fine - I Would Be More Than Just A Friend
You Know You've Changed My Life - It Seems Like We're Meant To Be
I Wanna Be Your Wife - I Wonder Where Is The Key?

Verse Greg:
I Was Lying To Myself
You Found Someone Else Far Away
But I Believe In Miracles
Maybe I'll Get You One Day

Climb Linda:
Nothing Is Like It Seems
It Is More Than A Simple Game
Let Me Feel I'm The One
Can't You Hear Me Calling Your Name

Chorus:
If I Could Turn Back Time - If I Could Turn Back Time Again
I Wish You Will Be Mine - I Would Be More Than Just A Friend
I Even Can't Describe - It Seems Like We're Meant To Be
What I Feel Deep Inside - I Wonder Where Is The Key?
If I Could Turn Back Time - If I Could Turn Back Time Again
There's Someone Always Fine - I Would Be More Than Just A Friend
You Know You've Changed My Life - It Seems Like We're Meant To Be
I Wanna Be Your Wife - I Wonder Where Is The Key?

Greg:
If I Could Turn Back Time Again
I Would Be More Than Just A Friend
It Seems Like We Were Meant To Be
I Wonder Where Is The Key

Climb Linda:
Since The Day I Met You
I Just Know I Didn't Feel The Same
You're The One I Adore
Can't You Hear Me Calling Your Name
