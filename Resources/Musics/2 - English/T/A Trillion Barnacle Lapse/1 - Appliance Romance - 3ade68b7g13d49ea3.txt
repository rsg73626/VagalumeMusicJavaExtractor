APPLIANCE ROMANCE

What is it worth proteins that make life so dull?
This new sodomization beats the thrills of masturbation.
This organism is now erect and the mechanism is prepared to concept.
He crashed into my arms and made my life condensed.
Rice was thrown.
Champagne was popped.
He gave me a synthetic flower to win my synthetic heart.
It was a cordial affair in cordial attire.
Now those newlyweds are soon to be retired, just give a chance to this appliance.
