A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE

Time and time and time again 
My loneliness is my only friend. 
I just keep on sitting by the phone
Waiting for it to ring your tone. 
I just, want to, know that, you care
I just, want to, know that you’ll be there. 

So I sing this song to you.
Sorry I wasn’t, what you were looking for. 
But you just don’t get it at all. 
Life is always better, after the fall. 

Pieces are raining down on me. 
Wont wait, we can’t believe in this or anything at
all. 

After all you did, why would I care? Why should I
care? 
After, the pain you caused, why would I care? Why
should I care? 
I've waited for this so long, why would I care? Why
should I care? 

Loneliness, sadness, and solitude
These are a few of the things I’ve been through 
Waiting for anything, everyday 
Strange that you don’t seem to feel the same way 
Write me off, bury me and leave me for dead 
Open wide, eat your words and choke on regrets

After all you did, why would I care? Why should I
care? 
After, the pain you caused, why would I care? Why
should I care? 
I've waited for this so long, why would I care? Why
should I care?

Look through me (Tragedy’s not so bad)
Remember what was lost (Taking me down and more) 
Take all I give to you 
After what I’ve been through 
Go ahead take it all (I honestly don’t care at all)
Set up and ready to fall (Let it fall)
