LIGHT THIS FIRE

I’m sick and tired of the critics today
All you cynics and you haters
How you always act the same
You open up your mouth, but you’ve got nothing to say
You can never make us go away
We will always remain

We’ve got a chance now
Shout it out and lay it down
Everything we care about
Now we do it for ourselves
Yeah, we do it for ourselves and no one else
Not for anyone else

Light, light, light this fire
Turn it up now
Turn it up louder than loud
We’ve come back from the grave
This time you can’t turn away

You built us up just to watch us fall
We all thought that we were gone until we got that call
Felt our world come to a stop
Now we know that we are better off
(Yeah, we’re better off)

You. Don’t. Know. Who. We. Are.
You don’t know who we are!
You wrote something like we were aiming to please
But we won’t spend our lives on our knees.

We won’t. Give up. We won’t.
We won’t. Give up. We won’t.

Light, light, light this fire
Turn it up now
Turn it up louder than loud
We’ve come back from the grave
This time you can’t turn away
Yeah, we are destined to stay.

Light, light, light this fire
Turn it up now
Turn it up louder than loud
We’ve come back from the grave
Now you can’t turn away
So step up, so step up if you have something to say.

We face our fears, chase our dreams
(We face our fears, chase our dreams)
We love our music, we love our fans
When we go on tour, we hope it never ends
Everywhere we go, everywhere we’ve been
This is who we are, this is who I am

(Light, light, light this fire
Turn it up now
Turn it up louder than loud)

Light, light, light this fire

Light, light, light this fire
Turn it up now
Turn it up louder than loud
We’ve come back from the grave
This time you can’t turn away
Yeah, we are destined to stay

Light, light, light this fire
Turn it up now
Turn it up louder than loud
We’ve come back from the grave
This time you can’t turn away
So step up, so step up if you’ve got something to say
