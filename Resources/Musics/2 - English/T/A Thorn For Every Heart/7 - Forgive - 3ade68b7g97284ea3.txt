FORGIVE

Forgive 

Remember the things I promised you 
Forgotten to love you, you know its true 
I tumble then fall for you 
The truth now lies in angry eyes 
This time I'll pay the price 
Pay the price to rise 

This feelings got to go 
This pain just takes it's toll 
If you need me, let me know 
I'm here for you 
This feelings got to go 
This pain just takes it's toll 
If you need me, let me know 
I'm here for you 

All my life I learned from you 
The lessons I've learned are never through 
I'm sorry my father 
Your heart, my hand 
Not breaking it again 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
This will be the end 

Do you ever think of me? (You follow it underneath your skin) 
Where do we go to find what's within? 
Just let it go, always within 
(What lies) 
Always in you 
It falls apart 
In caves inward 
I'm the only one who floats below the rest 
Of the angels, of the angels, of the angels 

This feelings got to go 
This pain just takes it's toll 
If you need me, let me know 
I'm here for you 
This feelings got to go 
This pain just takes it's toll 
If you need me, let me know 
I'm here for you
