OBJECT OF NO DESIRE

Let the music get into you,
Feel the rhythm as it starts to fill you.
Do you want to? do you want to burn up?
Press your hips against mine.
We're making sparks and they're bound to ignite flames,
To keep us warm forever.
Don't stop, cause it's now or never.
We fight the feeling, but we just surrender,
To the things we fear the most in life.
Close your eyes and fall in love again.
Hold your breath and fall in love again.

Spinning around, we're going down but up in flames tonight,
My bleeding heart can't put this out.
And I didn't want to fall apart again,
Sweetheart before you lose me, tell me you love me truly.

I've always known that it's hard to move you,
I'd give my life for the words to soothe you.
Still they end up trapped behind my lips.
Oh baby, how you leave me tongue tied.
You've got me wishing I could stay the whole night,
I'm afraid to fall in love with you.

Spinning around, we're going down but up in flames tonight,
My bleeding heart can't put this out.
And I didn't want to fall apart again,
Sweetheart before you lose me, tell me you love me truly.

We all need a reason to just let go.
We wait for a moment that might not show.
Always looking ahead instead of looking around.
Always looking for something that's already found.
Sweetheart before you lose me, tell me you love me truly.

Spinning around, we're going down but up in flames tonight,
My bleeding heart can't put this out.
And I didn't want to fall apart again,
Set me up to break my heart again.

I didn't wanna fall, didn't wanna fall.
I didn't wanna fall in love again.
I didn't wanna fall, didn't wanna fall.
I didn't wanna fall in love again.

Sweetheart before you lose me, tell me you love me truly.
Sweetheart before you lose me, tell me you love me truly.
