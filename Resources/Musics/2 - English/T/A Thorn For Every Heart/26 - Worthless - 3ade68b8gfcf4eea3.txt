WORTHLESS

There are times in our lives
When we just cannot compromise
Can't take advice
But can deny
All of the things wrong in our lives
Need a reason for a new dream
When it seems like dawn won't come
Search for answers within the darkness
When it seems that there are none

I'm not coming home
There's nothing left there at all
Now I take this on my own

(We're part)
Of the bridges that we've crossed
(Forget)
All the loved ones that we've lost
(Scream out)
Till your lungs fill up with blood
Shut up and wait for the breakdown

Eyes closed
But what's the big deal?
Now darkness swallows me alive
Don't know what's the matter
Who cares cause it doesn't seem to matter now

I'm not coming home
(We are worthless we are lost)
There's nothing left there at all
Now I take this on my own
(We are reckless, we are young)

(We're part)
Of the bridges that we've crossed
(Forget)
Of the loved ones that we've lost
(Scream out)
Till your lungs fill up with blood
Shut up and wait for the breakdown

(We're part)
Of the bridges that we've crossed
(Forget)
Of the loved ones that we've lost
(Scream out)
Till your lungs fill up with blood
Shut up and wait for the breakdown, now

If I can't sleep tonight,
I'm gonna have to toss and turn
And go wandering through my mind
For everything I'll never find
And now I'm somewhere in between
Safe from the obscene
And I just want to make you all believe

We are worthless, we are numb
We are reckless, we are young
We are everything you aren't
We are worthless, we are lost
