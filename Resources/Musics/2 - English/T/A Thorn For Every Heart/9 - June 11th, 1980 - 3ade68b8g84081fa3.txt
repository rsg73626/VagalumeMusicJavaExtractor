JUNE 11TH, 1980

It's been such a long time since I've seen your face,
And maybe I ignore the sound of your voice.
It's leaving me empty you try to forget me.
These days and chances are looking slim.
I tell "You look nice." you say I'm looking thin.
I say "I haven't been eating or really been sleeping.
Just breathing and thinking of you."

I'm coming clean tonight.
I'm going to tell you everything I've been holding inside.
But I'm only wasting time.
I don't want to let you go.

I see you in his arms I'm faking a smile.
I watch as you finish the drink in your hand.
Pretend to be happy until you look at me.
Now we remember again.
Right now you know I could use a drink
Or even better yet maybe two or three.
Because I've never been over the pain,
And it helps me forget and go on once again.

I'm coming clean tonight.
I'm going to tell you everything I've been keeping inside.
But I'm only wasting time.
I don't want to let you go.

Now I'm sleeping I can breathe.
This is now a dream.
Under the moonlight and in your arms,
Always forever 'till everything's just fine.
Under this street light and in your eyes,
Always forever 'till everything's just fine.

I'm coming clean tonight.
I'm going to tell you everything I've been keeping inside.
But I'm only wasting time.
I don't want to let you go.
That I outta let you know.
