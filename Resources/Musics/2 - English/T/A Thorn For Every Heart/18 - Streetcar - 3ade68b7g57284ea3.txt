STREETCAR

Pieces are raining down on me. 
Wont wait, I can?t believe in this or anything at all. 
After all you did, why would I care? 
Why should I care? 
After, the pain you caused, why would I care? 
Why should I care? 
I've waited for this so long, why would I care? 
Why should I care? 

Loneliness, sadness, and solitude
These are a few of the things I?ve been through 
Waiting for everything, everyday 
Strange that you don?t seem to feel the same way 
Write me off, bury me and leave me for dead 
Open wide, eat your words and choke on regrets

After all you did, why would I care? 
Why should I care? 
After, the pain you caused, why would I care? 
Why should I care? 
I've waited for this so long, why would I care? 
Why should I care?

Look through me (Tragedy?s not so bad)
Remember what was left (Taking me down and more) 
Take all I give to you 
After what I?ve been through 
Go ahead take it all (I honestly don?t care at all)
Set up and ready to fall (Let it fall)
