NO MORE YOU

I can tell by your last five phone calls,
That you're going to raise hell with me tonight.
Same old stupid conversation,
Another perfect evening ruined by a jealous fight.
I never want to hear your voice because to me it's only noise.
I hope you stay away.

I can tell by the voice mails I've received,
Something's going on you're trying to blame it all on me.
I know we're sleeping up in your bed,
I tore her pictures down and burned the shit to cut our sweat.
I never want to hear your voice because to me it's only noise.
I hope you stay away.

When the radio plays this song,
I hope you can't help but sing along.
When the radio plays this song,
I hope you can't help but sing along.

You should know that the love you've wasted,
It isn't coming back you'll never find a love like me.
You'll never get me out of your head.
I wrote this song for you and named it so you can't forget.
I never want to hear your voice because to me it's only noise.
I hope you stay away.

When the radio plays this song,
I hope you can't help but sing along.
When the radio plays this song,
I hope you can't help but sing along.

Now we say goodbye.
Now we say goodbye.
But you never showed it, you never showed it.
No intention, you never noticed,
How you really made me feel inside.
Now it isn't worth remembering.
I think it's time to forget.

When the radio plays this song,
I hope you can't help but sing along.
When the radio plays this song,
I hope you can't help but sing along.
