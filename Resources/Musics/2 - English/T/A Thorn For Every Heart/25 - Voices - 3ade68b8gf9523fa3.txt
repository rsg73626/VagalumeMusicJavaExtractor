VOICES

(I just cracked and I've never felt better.
Don't call me crazy.
Until now I've seen new things I've never seen.)

The memories of you have built up to be true, coming down now.
(They're coming down, they're coming down.)
And all of the rules that all I ever use are gone.
(And now they're gone, and now they're gone.)

Try being around be in my mind a while,
You'll find I'm much more different than you.
I hear voices this world has never known.
See the brilliant colors.
Try stepping outside of yourself,
See the world through eyes of someone else.
Let go of the world you used to know.
See the brilliant colors.

I just cracked and I've never felt better.
Don't call me crazy.
Until now I've seen new things I've never seen before
These days we count how far to listen to it:
The voice inside my head.
The voice inside my head.
I've left myself without a good way out again.

Every hour doesn't even matter.
Everything I did is now gone.
Freak out, I was destined for right now.
I'm wound out and don't know I'm bound to say.
Every minute never seems to finish.
A second I'm holding this off.
Won't stop, I'm stuck in the moment,
I want out and that's not nearly enough.

I just cracked and I've never felt better.
Don't call me crazy.
Until now I've seen new things I've never seen before.
I just cracked and I've never felt better.
Don't call me crazy.
Until now I've seen new things I've never seen before.

Staring at a white room, taking lots of medicine.
The doctor tells me that I'm sick because I'm never listening.
I don't know how things got this way.
I'm settled in now so I might as well stay.
Trapped in a straightjacket, serious as a heart attack.
The nurses bring me sedatives so I can finally relax.
Don't know how things got this way.
I'm settled in now so I might as well stay.

(I just cracked and I've never felt better.
Don't call me crazy until now.
I just cracked and I've never felt better.
Don't call me crazy until now.)
