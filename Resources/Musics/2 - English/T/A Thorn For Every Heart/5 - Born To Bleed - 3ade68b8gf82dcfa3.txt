BORN TO BLEED

Some people think that you're a bore now
Because you live your life in a haze
But who to try and tell you how
How you should spend the best of your days

And you never dream cuz you're barely sleeping
But still you keep your head in the clouds
You never come back down
Oh whoa whoa whoa

You've never really been one for complaining
You've always kept your pain to yourself
Bottled up inside it bothers no one else
But really there's just no one to tell

If you're getting high then why do you feel so damn low
I think it's getting out of control
The fuse is burning slow but still about to blow
I think it's getting out of control

And you never dream cuz you're barely sleeping
But still you keep your head in the clouds
You never come back down
Never come back down
Oh whoa whoa whoa

I get the feeling you were born to bleed
Yeah I've heard the story that you're down on your luck
Can bet you feel like your stuck
Well now enough is enough
Cuz only you can make it better
Only you can make it stop
Living in the moment but you're racing the clock for sure

If you're getting high then why do you feel so damn low
I think it's getting out of control
The fuse is burning slow but still about to blow
I think it's getting out of control

And you never dream cuz you're barely sleeping
But still you keep your head in the clouds
You never come back down
Never come back down
Back down
This is what you get you get a hole in your head
A hole that matches your chest so that we never forget
This is what you get the only place feel safe
A cold empty heart, one filled with regret

Regret (I get the feeling you were born to bleed)
This is the last time the very last time
One will make it better and one will make it stop
Your pulse is racing your stomach tied in knots
Blood cells in your body now they gather to clot

Staring in the mirror it has never been clearer
Eyes are dilated you can see what you've created
Staring in the mirror it has never been clearer
Living in the moment it is the minute your heart stops

And you never dream cuz you're barely sleeping
But still you keep your head in the clouds
You never come back down
Never come back down
This is what you get you get a hole in your head
A hole that matches your chest so that we never forget
This is what you get the only place feel safe
A cold empty heart, filled with regret
