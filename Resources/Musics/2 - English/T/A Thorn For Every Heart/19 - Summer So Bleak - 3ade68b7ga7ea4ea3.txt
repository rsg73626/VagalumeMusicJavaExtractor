SUMMER SO BLEAK

We're not, not like you
The summer is coming now
We're not, not like you
Your heart is untrue
The answers are ringing out
The pain you create can make a scar
You'll fall apart, you went too far
Now that the summers gone
We're not, not like you
Your heart is untrue
The endings are raining down
Why do you run away from fears
You'll fall apart, you'll fall for years

Good bye sky, hello destiny
(Now that the summers gone)
The clock is ticking but you cease to recognize
(Well where are you now?)
What this house meant to me
(The endings are raining down)
What does all this mean
(What's next now?)

The trust is gone, lessons learned
It will always be and I'm all done

Crash and crawl away
Crash and crawl away
Now I'm not afraid
Now I'm not afraid

Swallow and forget
Swallow this regret
Crash

A swell of anger in the sea that is
The sea that is my moods
Its hard to move you, its hard to prove to you
(Slow down, slow down)
All that I can do
A heart of stone to match the concrete wings
(Slow down, slow down)
You gave to me that day
And now we've gone our separate ways
(Slow down, slow down)

Good bye sky, hello destiny
(Now that the summers gone)
The clock is ticking but you cease to recognize
(Well where are you now?)
What this house meant to me
(The endings are raining down)
What does all this mean
(What's next now?)
