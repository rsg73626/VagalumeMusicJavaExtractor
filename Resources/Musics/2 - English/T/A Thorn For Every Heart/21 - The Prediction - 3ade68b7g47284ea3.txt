THE PREDICTION

Watch this slow death
Rewind this up
Rewind this up for good

Pulled out from under
Your crashing your cover now
(Oh, were feeling lost in the dark)

It's the end of it all
We know it's only our(my) fault

Pulled out from under
Your crashing your cover now
(Feeling lost in the dark)

Trapped in the wreckage
Surrounded by part of the friends I lost..
I'm watching you all
I'm trying to call out but I just can't
(provide the words.. that your longing for..)

My soul is leaving my body behind
I'm trying just to talk to you
Why, why, this is the end of my life
I didn't get to talk to you..

You cry at the funeral
I'm crying above you

The wind on your face
And the rain on your back
I'll be there, I'll be with you..

Watch this slow death
Rewind this up
Rewind this up for good

Pulled out from under
Your crashing your cover
(Oh, we're feeling lost in the dark)

It's the end of it all
We know it's only our(my) fault

Pulled out from under
Your crashing your cover
(We're feeling lost in the dark)

Now we're floating away [x2]
And we're floating away (away, away...)
The fears I've had are floating away
The dreams I've had have come to pass [x2]
