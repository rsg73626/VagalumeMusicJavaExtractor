IT'S HARD TO MOVE YOU

Let's just assume that you're always right,
But you still want to put up a fight.
Turn your back and walk away,
Cause there's nothing left for me to say.
And all and all you're barely getting by.
You're never satisfied.
Open your ears and shut your eyes (shut your eyes).

It's hard to move you when you're dead inside.
There's nothingness in your eyes.
I can't impress you when you're not alive.
Why do we even try?

All and all you never use your mind.
And you're following the blind.
Open your eyes and see the light (open and see the light).

It's hard to move you when you're dead inside.
There's nothingness in your eyes.
I can't impress you when you're not alive.
Why do we even try?

I've always known it's hard to move the ones that don't believe in dreams.
I try my hardest just to reach you but you still don't feel a thing.
And all of the empathy inside this world, you know it's killing me.
I've always known it's hard to move the ones that don't believe in dreams.
You don't believe in anything.

You don't feel a thing at all.
(It's hard to move you.)
You don't feel a thing at all.
(It's hard to move you.)

I've always known it's hard to move the ones that don't believe in dreams.
I try my hardest just to reach you but you still don't feel a thing.
And all of the empathy inside this world, you know it's killing me.
I've always known it's hard to move the ones that don't believe in dreams.
I've always known it's hard to move the ones that don't believe in dreams.
I try my hardest just to reach you but you still don't feel a thing.
And all of the empathy inside this world, you know it's killing me.
I've always known it's hard to move the ones that don't believe in dreams.
