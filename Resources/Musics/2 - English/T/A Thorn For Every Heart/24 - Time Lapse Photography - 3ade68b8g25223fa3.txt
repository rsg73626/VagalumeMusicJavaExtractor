TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY

Friends change, the faces will rearrange.
When will tomorrow be yesterday?
I know what I want to come next.
I don't know what I'm becoming.
A town grows and watch as they build it,
This happens brick by brick.
You can't tell how long it'll stand,
And if it falls will they rebuild it again?

The things that we know we've got to let them go.
Cause they'll grow sometimes too fast for us to realize.
Accept it. Accept this.

We miss these changes day by day,
They turn to dust and then blow away.
These aren't changes in our eyes,
It's only life that's passing by.

The world spins the same as a rose blooms,
It happens but it's invisible to you.
Nothing here can last forever,
Unless you always remember.
The leaves fall, the trees become bare again.
The fall ends and we start a new year,
And then no one knows what changes will come.
It's too slow, it's too subtle to notice one.
Accept it. Accept this.

We miss these changes day by day,
They turn to dust and then blow away.
These aren't changes in our eyes,
It's only life that's passing by.

Things will come and things will go,
When it ends we'll never know.
We'll live our lives and carry on,
Until it's over until it's gone.

The things that we know, we've got to let them go.
Cause they will grow sometimes too fast for us to realize.
Nothing here can last forever,
Unless you always remember.

We miss these changes day by day,
They turn to dust and then blow away.
These aren't changes in our eyes,
It's only life that's passing by.

Things will come and things will go,
When it ends we'll never know.
We'll live our lives and carry on,
Until it's over until it's gone.
