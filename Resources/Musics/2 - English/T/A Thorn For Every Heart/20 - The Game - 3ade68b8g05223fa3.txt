THE GAME

What are they gonna say when you just move along?
We'll get you out of here, just be strong,
(We'll get you, get you out.)
I thought I saw you today, I couldn't be wrong.
(Oh, and you have changed.)
You were caught between the lines and you couldn't get out.
It's been a few years since you left home.
Do you miss your residence?
Just keep on trying and you'll get out soon.
You'll get out soon.

I think you're doing much better but you say I fold.
You think you're oh so clever but you say I fold.
You say I fold.
Give up and give up and move on and move on,
With the rest, with the rest of your lonely life.

Have you selled yourself?
It's such a shame the way they use you up, destroy your name.
We'll get you out of here, just be strong.
Gonna bend the life you can't get out.

I think you're doing much better but you say I fold.
You think you're oh so clever but you say I fold.
You say I fold.
Give up and give up and move on and move on,
With the rest, with the rest of your lonely life.

I think you're doing much better but you say I fold.
You think you're oh so clever but you say I fold.
(Give up and give up and give up and give up)
You say I fold.
(And move on and move on)
You say I fold.
(With the rest, with the rest)
You say I fold.
