PRETTY WHEN YOU CRY

And all of the things we need 
(I just can’t sit here and wait for long)
They always seem to be so far out of reach for you and me.
(To get there, together, call it out.)
And all of the lives we've lived. 
(My eyes are closed cause what I’ve seen is gone)
They only seem to take before they give to you and I.
(Crush me; suffer, for others…)

Watch and wonder. What you are and where you'll be. 
I'll be waiting; I'll be waiting…
Sleep in splendour while your dreams are whispering. 
Come on and catch me. Try and catch me. 
I noticed at times like these I feel about a million miles away. 
I never believed in me, I think its time to start.
(Time to start)

And all of the things we need 
(I just can’t sit here and wait for long)
They always seem to be so far out of reach for you and me.
(To get there, together, call it out.)
And all of the lives we've lived. 
(My eyes are closed cause what I’ve seen is gone)
They only seem to take before they give to you and I.
(Crush me; suffer, for others…)

Start defending all the things that you believe.
Now you're ready, now you're ready. 
Don’t surrender all the hope that you should keep. 
It’s now or never, now or never.
Never an end to please, I always seem to end up on my knees. 
I've always believed in this I think its time to stop, 
(Stop right now)

And all of the things we need 
(I just can’t sit here and wait for long)
They always seem to be so far out of reach for you and me.
(To get there, together, call it out.)
And all of the lives we've lived. 
(My eyes are closed cause what I’ve seen is gone)
They only seem to take before they give to you and I.
(Crush me; suffer, for others…)

Emptiness that seems to fill you
The kind of pain that shall consume you
The walls move and close in on you
Think fast what would you do? 
Right now we can’t find answers
To the pain that I am causing
And wait for this world to die
So we can finally rise

And all of the things we need 
(I just can’t sit here and wait for long)
They always seem to be so far out of reach for you and me.
(To get there, together, call it out.)
And all of the lives we've lived. 
(My eyes are closed cause what I’ve seen is gone)
They only seem to take before they give to you and I.
(Crush me; suffer, for others…)

Seasons will go, be grateful. 
So I say goodnight, for you. Cause you want it that way 
I can see what you mean to me now. 
So I’m waiting now, I’m waiting now.
