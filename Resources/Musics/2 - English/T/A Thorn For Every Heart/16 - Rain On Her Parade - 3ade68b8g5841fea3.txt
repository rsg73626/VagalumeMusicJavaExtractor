RAIN ON HER PARADE

Have you ever loved her? I have, and it hurts 
To watch you fall like you were nothing. What for? 
Your youth is lost. 

And I punch the walls. Do you care at all? 
Those days were forever ours. 
Your forgotten lies. 
They stood the test of time

So I take this opportunity, to tell you 
What you don’t mean to me. 
You grievances have left me standing still
Under a dark grey sky, we've come undone. 

And you've lost it all. 
You think you’re so beautiful. Says who?
With scars of our love, so beautiful, says who? 

Before they throw you a parade 
We should dispose of your charades 
If they only knew (The person that you are) 
The person I could be (The person you could've been) 
Through rise and fall 
You lost it all, you lost it all, you lost it all…

So can I really love her? I have, and I know it hurts. 
Many times, I felt like I was nothing. What for? 
I'll never know (I’ve lost it all).
