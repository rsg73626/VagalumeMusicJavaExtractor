PICK UP THE PIECES

I am running with a heavy heart
It's like an anchor making sure I never get too far
I am wounded and nearly torn apart
It feels like it's all too much

What do you do when you can't get up?
(You take it back and start again.)
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming in
What do you do when you can't go home?
(You take it back and start again)

Pick up the pieces and put me together
Tell me everything is gonna be okay
Give me a reason to get up again
Taken more than any one should ever take

I've been buried, yeah, I've been left for dead
Don't think I'm ever gonna see the light of day again
Scratch the surface for the air above
I try but it's not enough

What do you do when you can't get up?
You just take comfort knowing
you can't get much lower than you are

Pick up the pieces and put me together
Tell me everything is gonna be okay
Give me a reason to get up again
Taken more than any one should ever take

Pick up the pieces and put me together
Tell me everything is gonna be okay
Give me a reason to get up again

And I swear, I'll never sin again
And I swear, I'll never sin again

Things are never gonna be the same
And all I have to say is
You're the only one to blame
With the bad mistakes that you know I made
I don't think that I am ever gonna make a change

What do you do when you can't get up?
You just take comfort knowing
you can't get much lower than you are

Pick up the pieces and put me together
Tell me everything is gonna be okay
Give me a reason to get up again
Taken more than any one should ever take

Pick up the pieces and put me together
Tell me everything is gonna be okay
Give me a reason to get up again
