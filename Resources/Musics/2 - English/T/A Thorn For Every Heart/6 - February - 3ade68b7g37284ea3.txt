FEBRUARY

"February"

In my Country their in the distance (Everytime I leave it's not the time to try)
Did you think before you got it (I'm leaving for all reasons)
Everytime you breathe i hope you think of me
Those are the words you told me, told me

One question why'd I have to leave? (I guess it's time to leave)
One reason i restored with sleep (I'll think of what I'll be)
This moment feels like destiny (I won't dare to eat)
Won't you tell me, tell me?

You want me to always remember
I promise I always will
You'll watch and you'll wait for my return
I promise I'm coming home

For all the loney nights when you're not feeling alone
You'll taunt the midnight sky and wish the sunrise
This the life we live, the only one that we know, 
these things just never end, never end

You want me to always remember
I promise I always will
You'll watch and you'll wait for my return
I promise I'm coming home

It's not the time to leave, its not the last goodbye (don't know I can't resist this)
Did you think before you've all forgot it? (I'm destined to always come home)
Everytime you breathe i hope you think of me
Those are the words you told me, told me

So when will it end?
When will it end?
When will it end?
When will it end?

Sometimes I don't know
Where I am
Where I'll be

Feels like I'm so far, far away
Far away from home
