SOUNDS AND SILENCE

Sirens racing, heading northbound on the freeway.
Tragedy has happened early in the morning today.
Best friend, my best friend's gone for sure.
I'm never gonna get him back.
I spent a lifetime trying, trying to be someone.
Trying to get things right,
Now I'll never get to show you.

Never forget him, we'll never.
He'll never be gone.
Never forget him, we'll never.
He'll never be gone.
(He fell and he hit the ground)
Never even made a sound, never even made a sound.

Pacing and waiting in this empty hospital.
Dying in wait, he desperately clings for life.
Suddenly, I'm facing the fear that I've wasted time.
(Hold on, don't let go yet.)
(Not now, it's not your time.)
My best friend, my best friend's gone for sure.
I'm never gonna get him back.

Is this really happening to us now?
I believe it is.
Just please forgive me.
Don't forget me.
Is this really happening to us now?
I believe it is.
Just please forgive me.
Don't forget me.

Tell me doctor, we've got a heart beat.
Tell me doctor, we've found a pulse now.
Tell me doctor, we've got a heart beat.
Tell me doctor, we've found a pulse now.
Now the heartbeat's gone, now the heartbeat's gone.

(He fell and he hit the ground.)
Never even made a sound, never even made a sound.
Never forget him, we'll never.
He'll never be gone.
Never forget him, we'll never
He'll never be gone.
(He fell and he hit the ground.)
Never even made a sound, never gonna get him back.

Is this really happening to us now?
I believe it is.
Just please forgive me.
Is this really happening to us now?
I believe it is.
Just please forgive me.
Don't forget me.
Is this really happening to us now?
I believe it is.
Just please forgive me.
Don't forget me.
