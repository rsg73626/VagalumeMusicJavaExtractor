BITTER PARTY OF ONE

Hide, hide from your life,
Bury yourself in the drugs that you try.
Cry, cry out your eyes no ones gonna buy your lies not this time

We were friends but now were enemies
There's a thousand different reasons that you wouldn't believe
I know you haven't got a thing,
Every day it brings you to your knees.
You're looking back to all the things that you had,
Your all alone it leaves you bitter and sad.
We see you as you are, weak and lonely now you'll play the part.

We don't even need you anymore.
This is it this is really goodbye,
Cause you burnt all the bridges and severed the ties.
We wont hear you when your cry.
Your already dead inside.
You lost your lovers abandoned your friends,
Enjoy the taste of your pills this is really the end.
So take your medicine, we don't want to see your face again.

Reflecting back to all the places you've been,
How would it feel to never see um again?You've done this to yourself.
Just move on and ruin something else.
I point a finger, you point all ten back.
You took the credit there I said it's a matter of fact.
If you were all the talent well then where are you at?
I hope your somewhere in the gutter lying flat on your back.

We don't even need you anymore.
This is it this is really goodbye,
Cause you burnt all the bridges and severed the ties.
We wont hear you when your cry.
Your already dead inside.
You lost your lovers abandoned your friends,
Enjoy the taste of your pills this is really the end.
So take your medicine, we don't want to see your face again.

Never gonna get,
Never gonna get,
You should know you're never gonna get,
Never gonna get
Any better, better, never, any better, better,
Better then you are.
