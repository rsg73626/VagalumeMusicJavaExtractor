JUNK

Motor cars, handle bars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee

Parachutes, army boots
Something old and new
Memories for you and me

Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

"Buy! Buy! "
Says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why? "
Says the junk in the yard

Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Sentimental jamboree

"Buy! Buy! "
Says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why? "
Says the junk in the yard
