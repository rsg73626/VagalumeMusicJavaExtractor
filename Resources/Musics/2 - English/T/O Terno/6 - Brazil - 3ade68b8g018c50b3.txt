BRAZIL

How do you think that we live in brazil?
Hanging with the monkeys of beaches of rio?
How do you think that we go to our schools?
Climbing our lions on dirt avenues?

Forests of silver and mountains of gold
Everything seems so unreal
The warm breeze that blows in the nights of brazil
The light of the moon on a river reveals
Brazil

Where do you think that we live in brazil?
On those fun little houses attached to the hills?
How do you think that we do to survive?
Well, rich robbing poor people
That's trully wild

Carnival, football
No clouds in the skyes
Just found a lost paradise
The warm breeze that blows in the nights of brazil
The light of the moon on a river reveals
Brazil
