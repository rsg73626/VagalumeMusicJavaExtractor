SO MUCH FOR MIDDLE EARTH

Of they've welcomed you, they are sorcerers… they wish to become kings
They wish to become gods.
So much for this middle earth. So much for their ruined hearts
The slaughters lay their plans and the alchemists sing their chants.
You won't be taking me.
This has always been their plan… to erase His name and become a god.
Seek them out and find their holes.
But in end who needs an ally… when you already have a God.
Conquer my fear. Conquer.
