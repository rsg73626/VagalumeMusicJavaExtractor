COMPLETE RELINQUISH, UTTER ABANDON

So here I am broken open.
Emptied of myself… of my regrets.
You said you'd soon return, so I'll light a fire, guard the flame and let it burn
So here I am broke open, yours alone.
Await the day for you to come… to go back home.
So please don't you tarry long… in your presence is where I want to belong
So please don't you tarry long… here I am letting go, yours alone
So here I am broken open. Yours alone, yours alone Lord.
This is me, broken open. Yours alone
