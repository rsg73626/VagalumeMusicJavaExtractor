A BAND OF HUNTERS STALK IN EDO

Hired guns will honor nothing
They're opportunists at their bestâ€¦ they're opportunists at their least
A death dealer peddling, a peddler dealing in death
Trafficking spirits and phantoms, vendor to devils and demons
They'll keep to shadows, the cowards
Forward, forward give them nothing
Forward, onward make them regret
Tonight, I'm hunting the hunter with the hunted, the haunted with his prey.
They will suffer us, for we will fix our hearts
Goodbye planet earth, farewell planet earth.
