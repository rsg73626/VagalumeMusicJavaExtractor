CURSES! ANOTHER SHAPE-SHIFTING WRAITH!

Hail to an end, she has come… winter's come
A faint horse for a fainting summer… steady your heart
This will take your warmth.
This will turn your ghost.
Come quick my Lord, they altered shape… they've altered form

Marching to this song, singing to this song
Soldiers marching.
Armies running.
Squadrons... and swarming legions
Fearless we take them one ghost by one
Heaven approaching hail to the end

marching to this song, singing to this song
Fearless we will take them…
one ghost by one
