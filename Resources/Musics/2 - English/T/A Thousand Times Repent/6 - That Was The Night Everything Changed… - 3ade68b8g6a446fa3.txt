THAT WAS THE NIGHT EVERYTHING CHANGED…

They have cloaked almost every word, the blackest hearts
and with his ghost clouded, the alchemists will seek his allegiance
Some crowns darken the heads they dress
and with devils on their thrones… kingdoms will spoil

Frozen rivers bring their bones so…
Kill them all, destroy them!
We forget who we are, and we forget what they've done.
And we'll pull you out… for it's all over now.
