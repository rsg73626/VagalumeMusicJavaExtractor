MEAN OLD WORLD

This is a mean old world, baby, to live in by yourself
This is a mean old world to live in by your self
When you can't get the woman you love, you know she's loving someone else
Well, I drink to keep from worrying and I smile to keep from crying
I drink to keep from worrying, baby, I smile to keep from crying
That's to keep the public from knowing just what I have on my mind
Some day, some day, baby, I'll be six feet in my grave
Some day, some day, darling, I'll be six feet in my grave
And, I won't be around here to be mistreated, darling, like a low-down slave
