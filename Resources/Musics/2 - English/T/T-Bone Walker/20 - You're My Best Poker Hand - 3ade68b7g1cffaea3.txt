YOU'RE MY BEST POKER HAND

I've got a five card hand and i don't know how to play (2x)
I need a queen like you to make my hand ok

The kid drew three aces and stacked them back to back (2x)
I looked at my hand and not a smile did i crack

When the deal goes down i've only drawed one card (2x)
And if you play poker, you know that sure is hard

The kid spread his hand and began to blush
The kid spread his hand and then began to blush
But his face turned pale when he saw my queen high flush
