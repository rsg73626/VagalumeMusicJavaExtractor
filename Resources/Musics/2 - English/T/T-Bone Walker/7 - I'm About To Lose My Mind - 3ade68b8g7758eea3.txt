I'M ABOUT TO LOSE MY MIND

You broke my heart, baby just one too many time
You broke my heart, baby just too many time
From drinkin' bad whiskey, mama, gin an rum an wine
Well, today you say you're quittin', tomorrow you say you're not
Yes, you say you quittin', tomorrow you say you're not
An if ya don't stop drinkin' baby, I swear you're gonna blow your top
Yes, drinkin' woman, you stay drunk all the time
Yes, drinkin' woman, you stay drunk all the time
You keep me so worried baby, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
