PAPA AIN'T SALTY NO MORE

Come home little girl, your papa ain't
salty
no more
Come home little girl, your papa ain't salty no more
I need your love, and I swear I miss you so
I know I was wrong, and I know I've caused you pains
I know I was wrong, and I know I've caused you pains
I'm sorry pretty baby, I won't do that again
Why, oh why pretty baby, why did you have to go
Please come back home pretty mama
Papa ain't salty no more
