Men wanna swerve in this untouchable curve million dollar pearl
so who got the nerve say you want it like this you need it like that
disposin' yo spin now adios like that and lemme tell you how da story progressed
quest for da sex overnight like fedex you movin on so fast
your faded from da ex distorted mentality & confidence oppressed
you distressed baby here's one for the don swore he'd stick
around butta you was wrong it's time the ladies took control
baby it's on all and together now you know the song

Pump pump one finger to the roof all in together now
this is how we do clap clap your hands sone sonbyogul
bushyoboryo munoturyo ni mamsoge byogul

Ijen neshigan ne charye gu jalnan gamue mungchyo podpodhan ne moganul
hwag phurojuryo rhyme e uljigerul igo clap ni morie what ni
moriwie hamburo kabulda byol shiboge ni gwiyophe donggurohge songarag
hanara aju yoyuige nol sulchog toiro non yo dene dun knocker out
ije kuth finish to game over the end of your drama outro musici
ollagalte irumobnun extra non babo nan ganghanyoja Cleopatra

Hush hunsh gisang dongjagguman took a back seat now it's my turn to shine
ijenun chamnungodo imankhumman nidul nonun jidgorie gin hansumman
used n from chauvinistic ways yojonge midogman gangyohanun
plays machi mulgonobnun neshiga e mandulgi geshi
funny how you can justify somethin' you can't define

Bogo beunge gugodpunin non gurolsu bake kwag maghin sasangsoge non chyobaghyo
sane yojaege sondenun non ni mudomul pane jiogheng yolcha ane ildungsoge
tane chondunggwa bonge when I peak like dante you get beat na hande
non handegamdo andwe oje jal derigo noldani songaragjil hane non byonte
maricone wonjogyoje sagikun nege madnun yagun gugol saldughan gawipun
dun knocked out it's the end of ya babo na beautful the Cleopatra
