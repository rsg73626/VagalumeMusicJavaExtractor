BECAUSE I LOVE YOU

It's a lovely morning

idero shigani momchuo jugirul oh yeh baby
noui gyothe yongwonhi jamdulgo shipho nomudo sarangsuron gudeigie

Baby one day when it's beautiful
I'll take my love I'll share my soul
gudemani naui sarangingojyo yaiyaiya
through the good times and the bad times
been through it all been through it all
gudemani naui sarangingojyo yaiyaiya

Teronun gu modun goshida tutero doejiga anha (that's right)

insengiran jo homhan padorul nomo jugdorog urihamke saranghalleyo

Baby one day when it's beautiful
I'll take my love I'll share my soul
gudemani naui sarangingojyo yaiyaiya
through the good times and the bad times
been through it all been through it all
gudemani naui sarangingojyo yaiyaiya

Noui gyothe yongwonhi jamdulgo shipho nomudo sarangsuron gudeigie

Baby one day when it's beautiful
I'll take my love I'll share my soul

been through it all been through it all
gudemani naui sarangingojyo yaiyaiya
