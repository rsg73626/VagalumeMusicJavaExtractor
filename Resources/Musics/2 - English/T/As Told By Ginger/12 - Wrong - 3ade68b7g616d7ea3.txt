WRONG

I know I said back then
Never wanted to see you again
But I was wrong
Baby, I was wrong
Nine times out of ten
It seems to happen
That I'm wrong
Baby, I'm wrong
Each day that passes
I can't, although I try
Each day, it hits me
I can't live with goodbye
I know I said back then...
(song ends here)
