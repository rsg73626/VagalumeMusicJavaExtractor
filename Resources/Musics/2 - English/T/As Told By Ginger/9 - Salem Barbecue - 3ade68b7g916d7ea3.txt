SALEM BARBECUE

There's no way we'll ever believe you
This girl's asleep, so tell us, what did you do?
She's a witch, you can't deny
So on the pyre ye shall fry
At our good old-fashioned Salem barbecue!

There's no way we'll ever believe you
See the truth in all of her boo-hoo
She's a witch - just watch her fly!
Escape? Don't you even try!
You're our guest at our Salem barbecue!

There's no way we'll ever believe you
There must be something more that I can do
Prove to us you're not a witch
Too late - I've already snitched
I'll baste her at our Salem barbecue!
