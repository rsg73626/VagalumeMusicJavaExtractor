AS TOLD BY GINGER THEME SONG

Someone once told me 
The grass is much greener
On the other side
And I paid a visit 
(Well, it's possible I missed it)
It seemed different, 
Yet exactly the same
'Til further notice, 
('Til further notice,)
I'm in-between
(I'm in-between)
From where I'm standing, 
(From where I'm standing)
My grass is green

Someone once told me 
The grass is much greener
On the other side
