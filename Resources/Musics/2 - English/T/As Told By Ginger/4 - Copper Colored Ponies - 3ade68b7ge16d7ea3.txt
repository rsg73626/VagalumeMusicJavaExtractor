COPPER COLORED PONIES

There were 
Copper-colored ponies
There was air 
That smelled like rain
And the moon was 
Out in daytime
When I first 
Learned your name
And though the 
Clouds a-quickly moved in
Though the path 
Looked overgrown
The time that 
I spent talkin' to you
Made me feel 
Like I was home
