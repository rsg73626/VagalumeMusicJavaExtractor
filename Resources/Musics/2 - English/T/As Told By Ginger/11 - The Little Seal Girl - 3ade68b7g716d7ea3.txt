THE LITTLE SEAL GIRL

Most folks think that I'm not real
'Cause I'm half girl and I'm half seal
I'm a little seal girl livin' in the real world
And it's so hard to get by
'Cause seals can't even cry
But in this endless, boundless sea
Is there no one who looks like me
I know I must stay chipper,
One day I'll find a friend to hold my flipper
'Cause I'm a little seal girl livin' in the real world
And it's so hard to get by
'Cause seals can't even cry
