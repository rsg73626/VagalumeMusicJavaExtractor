HELLO STRANGER

Hello, stranger - you came just in time
I look for your face in a crowd, or in line

Hello, stranger - not a moment too soon
See, that old picture's fading in the drawer of my room
Now toys have gone lost, baby teeth have come loose
There were accidents involving stitches, spilt juice
Report cards were shown, and one time I got sick
But it's nothing I couldn't catch you up on real quick

Hello, stranger - I saved you a place
And it hardly seems strange now that I've seen your face
