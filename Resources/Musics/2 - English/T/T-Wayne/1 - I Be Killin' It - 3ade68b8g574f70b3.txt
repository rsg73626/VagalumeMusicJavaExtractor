I BE KILLIN' IT

Pot full there
Cause I be killing it
Play around with your bed
Cause I be killing it
I don't think I understand
And I be killing it
I take your girl
Cause I be killing it

Pot full there
Cause I be killing it
Play around with your bed
Cause I be killing it
I don't think I understand
And I be killing it
I take your girl
Cause I be killing it

Cause I be killing it
Boys don't understand
The 2 of them you know already
Trying to do it like me
But I'm too different
Used to be on my

But now I'm giving it
How the hell did you start it?
I don't fuck
Up in your city at the mall
Blowing up my phone
Oh, that's a call
I got these haters pissed
Let's go

They don't know that I kill it
I'm the cold -hearted
I don't even got to show it
Pull up to the club
Try to talk

Pot full there
Cause I be killing it
Play around with your bed
Cause I be killing it
I don't think I understand
And I be killing it
I take your girl
Cause I be killing it

Pot full there
Cause I be killing it
Play around with your bed
Cause I be killing it
I don't think I understand
And I be killing it
I take your girl
Cause I be killing it

I've been going needy since the start
Need a straight jacket
My flow too retarded
I be going dumb
Even though
I'm the smartest
Picasso couldn't take a better picture
I be with the band like I'm at school
Like a broken radio

He's fuckin' us out of the tune
Even in the sun
I be feeling cool
Got your baby momma trying to enjoy the cruise
I be flexin'
I can kill every kind
You can put that on my momma
I don't fool it
And I was bad when I was schooling
I went to the team
I was making movies, movies

Pot full there
Cause I be killing it
Play around with your bed
Cause I be killing it
I don't think I understand
And I be killing it
I take your girl
Cause I be killing it

Pot full there
Cause I be killing it
Play around with your bed
Cause I be killing it
I don't think I understand
And I be killing it
I take your girl
Cause I be killing it
