NASTY FREESTYLE

Yah, say Roro, you know what it is, right?
Who Is Rickey Wayne?: The Mixtape
Ya feel me? Yah, ahem

First lemme hop out the motherfuckin' porsche
I dont want her if that ass don't sit like a horse (kingpaul)
I be ballin on these niggas got me feeling like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet

I'm the king of this shit crown by the toilet
I'm just barely getting started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet I just took him to the vet
Homie I be making hits
I'm the rap derek jeter
let your bitch ride on me like she was on feder
If the pussy ain't good then I prolly won't feed her

Lil homie you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried about feature home boy yous a pee on
Toilet seat ass nigga man I swear you getting peed on
Man my jewelry so cold I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set just in case they wanna sleep on

Ya dig, I'm a full time player hopping out
an alligator sipping lean
And now or later homie
I'll annihilate you
if you think you wanna battle
you gon have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her I will never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely getting love in the city
travel to another town
You can bet they're fucking with me

I be killing this shit pray to God they forgive me
They saying when you blow up don't forget me
Man I've been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on your homie I ain't talking diapers

Walking to your function on point I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like dej loafs so don't try her
Flexin now you over home boy you ain't ready
Ten time sharper than michael myers machete (montavius)
B-b-b been about the money I ain't worried bout the fame
Bout to have everybody saying who is ricky wayne, dat me
