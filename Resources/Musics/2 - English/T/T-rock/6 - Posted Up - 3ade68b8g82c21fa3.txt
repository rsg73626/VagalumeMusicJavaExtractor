POSTED UP

[Chorus x2]
We posted up! We posted up from the front to the back
We posted up! We posted up blowing blunts by the packs
We posted up! We posted up with a trunk full of gats
We posted up! We posted up nigga you know where we at

[T-Rock]
I keep my money stash in the cellar
My life is crucial more suspense than a Stephen King seller
Beretta for chedda the bravest rebel living clever
I'll suffer you fellas go get the bullets off the dresser
Never snitch under investigation
Loud mouths can suffocate with no resuscitation
I'm in a Caprice with my player partners smoking mean and drinking Vodka
This is the continuation of the saga running like lava
Gunning and robbers I'm blunted with mobsters
Packing choppers so sophisticated still a shortstopper
Constantly a dope clocker to presidentials
Bitches run up get their vital organs this the symbol
Even my mental is a rebel longer level more psychotic than the devil himself
Resting with death until no vessels is left
Betraying ruthless get 'em bat 'em toothless
Checking and undisputed when I spew it to refuse it, we posted up!!

[Chorus x4]

[T-Rock]
Crashed and so called assassin afraid I'm blasting
Axes and hatchets where the drama with the tightest clashing
There's no compassion in the trail of tears
Drive bys and robberies I been dwelling in ATL for years
I slang hand to hand no procrastination
Worser than Candyman off of Final Destination
Blow it all up like Pakistan soldier desperation
Wipe 'em out like an avalanche no investigation
With slaying my customers exclusive
This for the players in the palms long out secluded
Whatever ruthless top of the line with shit that we grind like on the line
Glock and the nine doing the crime watch out for mine
Status superb assassins submerged stack up the bird
Attics I serve for trying the herb stacks like I serve
Move around from twelve making sells for mail
It's all about cash clienteles supplying prevailed

[Chorus x2]

[T-Rock]
I had no time for hiding too busy surviving
The way of life is adultered to death people coniving
Witness the evil rising alone my blood pressure
On to bring a suicide letters a test to be clever
Want me twisted on the stretcher too explicit for the chedda
This is for getting better now I'm gifted with Berettas
Since it wasn't for this rapping God blessing me with presidents
God is my witness I mass up and run in your residence
Come with no hesitance like a thief in the night
And frozen movie scripts G's who lived a secreted life, I said it
Bitches pathetic riding dick for the credit
Y'all out of hot or cold lukewarm niggaz and get ejected
Operation locked down glock rounds ecetera
Call it a cancellation gullotine's for head of cha
On my square I never moved from it
On a planet with sinisters snitches and fools run it ebonic and blunted..

[Chorus x2]
