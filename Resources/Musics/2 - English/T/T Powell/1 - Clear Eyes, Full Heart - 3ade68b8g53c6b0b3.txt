CLEAR EYES, FULL HEART

I got my fans in the stands, my team on my back
My family in my heart, I put my city on the map

See I'm cool with my school but I know I can do better
I checked the mail yesterday and not one college letter

Not one college offer after all this hard work
I'd be telling you a lie if I said it didn't hurt

So how do I stay focused in this game called life?
And do I have a fair chance when this world so schife?

See we all pay a price; I got some things on my mind
But I need to regain my focus, cause its game time

Give all, leave nothing
In the end, I got to choose

Clear eyes, full heart
I can't lose!

Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose
Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose

Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose
Clear eyes

Now look me in the eyes
And put your hand in mine

Forever is about to happen
Right here in this moment of time

So let's draw a line
Right here in the sand

And let it be said that on this very day
Is the day that we took a stand

Cause it's not just a game
It's more than a game
It's more than the hurt
It's more than the pain

It's more than the glory
It's more than the fame

This right here
Is about legacy man

So it's bigger than me
It's bigger than us

We can lose sight
In the mist of the fuss

Let's slow it down and take it in
Enjoy this moment, what's the rush

They want it bad, but we want it more
This is what we been waiting for

With tears in our eyes, we let our hearts roar
Unleash war when we walk out this door

We won't be delayed
We won't be denied

In the end, we won't be refused
With clear eyes, a full heart

There's no way that we can lose!

Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose
Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose

Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose
Clear eyes
