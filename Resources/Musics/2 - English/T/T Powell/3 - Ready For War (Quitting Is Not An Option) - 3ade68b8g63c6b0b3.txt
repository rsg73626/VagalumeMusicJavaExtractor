READY FOR WAR (QUITTING IS NOT AN OPTION)

Never give in never never never
In nothing great or small large or petty never give in
Except to convictions of honor and good sense
Never yield the course

Never yield to the apparently overwhelming likely enemy
Never never never

I got a superman spirit with an ali fight
Got my eyes on the prize
I ain't worried about the hype
See I came here for war so let's get this thing poppin'
I'm gonna finish what I started cause quittin's not an option

I got a superman spirit with an ali fight
Got my eyes on the prize
I ain't worried about the hype
See I came here for war so let's get this thing poppin'
I'm gonna finish what I started cause quittin's not an option

I've been criticized and doubted
They talk like I ain't bout it
I'm a volcano ready to erupt so I came here to get rowdy
Competition's talkin' reckless
But that's what I expected
I'm the Dwight Howard of this game so all this nonsense gets rejected
Only rage up in this cage I'm the king of this ring
I float just like a butterfly and like a bee is how I sting
I'm the king kong of this jungle so let's get ready to rumble
I have taken many blows and not one time
I have ever stumbled so keep calm in the storm and never let them stress you
Gotta keep ice in your veins while staying cool under pressure
A fire in your eyes a hunger in your heart
A resolve to never quit and a vow to finish what you start
There's no gain without no pain no testimony without a test
So when it's said and done you'll have a story to confess
So let's get ready for war
As we make our critics feel it with an ali fight and the superman spirit

I got a superman spirit with an ali fight
Got my eyes on the prize
I ain't worried about the hype
See I came here for war so let's get this thing poppin'
I'm gonna finish what I started cause quittin's not an option

I got a superman spirit with an ali fight
Got my eyes on the prize
I ain't worried about the hype
See I came here for war so let's get this thing poppin'
I'm gonna finish what I started cause quittin's not an option

As I sway from side to side my heart beatin' in my chest
Here's the moment of the truth to put these nay-sayers to rest
They said I couldn't do it I've been called an underachiever
Well here's my opportunity to turn them all into believers
So don't count me out just yet I'm just gettin' started
And if you bet against me I guarantee you will be sorry
I came to bring the pain I came to start a riot
The negativity they sell keep your money don't buy it
I'm the eagle on the lizard stay crafty like a wizard
So focused on my target like a sniper in a blizzard
I came here ready for war I came here ready for battle
I tossed and turned all through the night I call that sleepless in seattle
Rise and shine to the victory I'm here to write my history
Persevere through all the storms and I never let it get to me
With an ali fight and a superman spirit the opposition don't stand a chance
And I'm ready to let them feel it

I got a superman spirit with an ali fight
Got my eyes on the prize
I ain't worried about the hype
See I came here for war so let's get this thing poppin'
I'm gonna finish what I started cause quittin's not an option
