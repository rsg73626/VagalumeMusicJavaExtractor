I'M A BEAST

I'm a beast
Yeea, I'm in my own zone
It's beast mode time, so go hard or go home
I'm a beast
Yeea, I got it on my mind
See I came here to chine
So let's get it on the grind
I'm a beast
Yeea, I'm in my own zone
It's beast mode time, so go hard or go home
I'm a beast
Yeea, I got it on my mind
See I came here to chine
So let's get it on the grind
Step up in the building
Swagger on point, right
Put your seatbelt on
'cause it's gonna be a long night
It's gon' be a long fight

But then again mabye not
I'm about to get it in
Yea I got it on my mind
Let's end this thing and regulation
I ain't thinking overtime
'cause I ain't work overtime
I ain't trying to overgrind
And I transform to beast mode
Just like I
I came here to go hard
I love this game, it's all I got
That's why I going all loud
And give it everything I got
Yea, I give it all I got
As if it was my only shot
I wait again to win til the end
And til I pass out
