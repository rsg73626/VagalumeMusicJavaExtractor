DO THE RIGHT DANCE

When we make it we're gonna shake this town 
If they hate it we'll turn them upside down 
When they see us 
They'll come running out of every single door 
Just to hear us 
They'll listen over and over and on and on 

When the last chance comes along 
We better take it 
Do the right dance and be strong 
And then we'll make it right 
Hold me darlin' one more night 

They've been laughing for a long long time 
When it happens, it's gonna make me smile 
I've been praying 
For the break to come to make them eat their words 
They'll be saying, "Oh baby, we never doubted that you'd make it work" 

When the last chance comes along 
We better take it 
Do the right dance and be strong 
And then we'll make it right 
Hold me darlin' one more night 
Hold me tight, hold me tight 

And when I get there yeah! yeah! 
Oh they'll tell everybody they're a friend of mine 
And I'll forget that, oh baby 
They never cared whether we lived or died 

When the last chance comes along 
We better take it 
Do the right dance and be strong 
And then we'll make it 

When the last chance comes along 
We better take it 
Do the right dance and be strong 
And then we'll make it right 
Hold me darlin' one more night 
Hold me 
Hold me tight 

When the last chance comes 
Do the dance 
Now hold me tight 
Hold me tight 
When the last chance comes 
We better make it right
