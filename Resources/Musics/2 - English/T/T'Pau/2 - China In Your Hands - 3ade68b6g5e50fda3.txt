CHINA IN YOUR HANDS

It was a theme she had
On a scheme he had
Told in a foreign land
To take life on earth
To the second birth
And the man was in command
It was a flight on the wings
Of a young girl's dreams
That flew too far away
And we could make the monster live again

Oh hands move and heart beat on
Now life will return in this electric storm
A prophecy for a fantasy
The curse of a vivid mind

Don't push too far
Your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard
Because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might
Have set upon yourself
China in your hand

Come from greed
Never born of the seed
Took a life from a barren hand
Oh eyes wide
Like a child in the form of man
A story told
A mind of his own
An omen for our time

Don't push too far
Your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard
Because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might
Have set upon yourself
China in your hand
Oh your hand
Your dreams are china in your hand, wooah
Here in your hand
China in your hand, woh oh oh woh oh oh woh oh
Here in your hand

Woh! You take a flight on the wings of fantasy
Then you push too far
And make your dreams reality
Yeah! For the china in your hand
But you shouldn't push too hard

You take a flight on the wings of fantasy
Then you push too hard
You make those dreams reality
Yeah! China in your hands
But they're only dreams
