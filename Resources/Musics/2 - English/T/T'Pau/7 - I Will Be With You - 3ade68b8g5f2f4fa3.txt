I WILL BE WITH YOU

have this fantasy you come back and you forgive me

Oh
I'm sorry now.
I hear this melody
our tryst in rhapsody

And I'm listening.
I never thought I'd see the day when you and me

We'd be so far apart
and I miss you so much now.
But I know there's no way back yesterday.

I will be with you
you're here in my heart

But if you never come back again
we'll never be far apart.
I miss you so much
wherever you are

But if you never come back again
we'll never be far apart.

Here in my deepest dream
running through another scene

Having your love again

And no
it doesn't bother me
the time I spend in imagery

Well
it's how I live.
You see
I don't believe that we tried everything
Before our love died
and I just can't forget.
Is the one chance all we get?

I will be with you
you're in my heart
...

And I have such memories
but I don't like to resurrect them

Oh
you know they hurt me so much now.
And I know there's no way you'll be coming home.

I will be with you
you're here in my heart
