GIVING UP THE GHOST

I have waited patiently for your heart to call to me 
Across the great divide of the years that have slipped by 
All the long and lonely nights I lay bathed in pale moonlight 
Upon the bed we graced, now there's just a cold and empty space 
Even all my friends say it's time to let you go 
It is time to break the hold 

So I'm giving up the mention of your name 
And I'm giving up the vision of your face 
I'm forgiving us for letting go of love 
Giving up the one I want the most 
Giving up the ghost 

I don't search to find a cure, I don't do that anymore 
I learned to lay the blame on the strangers we became 
We were just one step away from a truth I couldn't face 
But I hoped against it all that our history would break our fall 
So I prayed for love to save us and I wished upon a star 
But you wished us far apart

So I'm giving up the mention of your name 
And I'm giving up the vision of your face 
I'm forgiving us for letting go of love 
Giving up the one I want the most 
Giving up the ghost 

It's time to let you go 
And you tried to show me how 
Well I'm listening to you now 
Your silence sends a message clear and loud 

So I'm giving up 
Baby I'm giving you up 
I'm forgiving us for letting go of love 
Giving up the one I want the most 
I'm giving up the ghost 

I'm giving up the mention of your name 
And I'm giving up the vision of your face 
I'm forgiving us for letting go of love 
Giving up the one I want the most 
I'm giving up the ghost 
It's time to let you go 
I'm giving up the ghost 
It's time to let you go 
I'm giving up the ghost
