YOU GIVE UP

Oooh yeah!
Ooooh yeaaah!

Another winter of your discontent
I know how you scream and shout
When nothing you see makes any sense
Invaluable excuses
Drop like pearls in your self defense
You never do nothing about nothing, no
Where's all your confidence

Why can't you reach for a closer dream
The reason you fail
Is you go to extremes
You don't have to lie
You gotta try
If you fall, you can call
But you don't have to crawl

You give up
Hah, baby when it gets too rough
You ain't got what it takes
No you ain't tough enough
You give up
You're lazy, when it starts to rock
And when you see a way out, you go
Oooh yeah!

Another day goes by
Another tale to tell
How you nearly made it oh so far
Yeah you nearly did really well
Now why can't you reach
For a closer dream
The people who care
They don't mind where you've been
You don't have to lie
You gotta try
If you fall
You can call
But you don't have to crawl

You give up
Hah, baby when it gets too rough
You ain't got what it takes
No you ain't tough enough
You give up
You're lazy, when it starts to rock
And when you see a way out, you go
Oooh yeah!
