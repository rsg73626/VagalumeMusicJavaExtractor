NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE

Let me tell you the story of my life 
About the fall from paradise that ended all my dreaming 
And I tried and tried, but I could not put it right 
So like a child on Christmas night, I just stopped believing

 
Now that you're gone, where do I run 
Who do I give this love to 
You, you threw it away 
Everyday I have to live without you 

Crowded room, I'm standing all alone 
And though the faces come and go 
Nobody seems to notice 
A tearful tune is on the radio 
Here to let me know 
My heart is overloaded 

Now that you're gone 
Where do I run 
Who do I give this love to 
You, you threw it away 
Everyday I have to live without you 

If I seem ok, it's just a masquerade 
The face I let you see hides the emptiness in me 

Now that you're gone 
Where do I run 
Who do I give this love to 
You, you threw it away 
Everyday I have to live without you 

Now that you're gone 
Where do I run 
Who do I give this love to 
You, you threw it away 
Everyday I have to live without you
