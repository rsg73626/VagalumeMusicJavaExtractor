MAKE LOVE TO ME

My mama said never talk to strangers 
And in my head I knew all the dangers 
Just a girl, but something inside 
Told me don't be afraid the time's right 

And when you left I had to run for cover 
So I took myself to many other lovers 
It doesn't matter what I let them do 
From everyone I learned a thing or two 

And I want you to make love to me 
Like you did before 
We could do everything 
I learned a whole lot more 
Oh baby, I'm a woman now 
I'm not the girl that you left behind 
But we can work on it honey 
'til it feels like the very first time 
You lay your hands on me 
I had to beg for more 
Together we turn the key 
Now I'm sure 
You're making love to me like the very first time 

Come on over here 
Lose your inhibitions 
I'm gonna make it clear 
It's not an imposition 
We'll take our time 
Moving it slow 
I just want you to know it's alright 

Make love to me 
Like you did before 
We could do everything 
I learned a whole lot more 
Oh baby, I'm a woman now 
I'm not the girl that was on your mind 
But we can work on it honey 
'til it feels like the very first time 

Do you wanna hold me baby (first time) 
Don't you wanna touch me (very first time) 
Won't you make love to me 

Make love to me 
Like you did before 
We could do everything 
I learned a whole lot more 
Come on baby, I'm a woman now 
I'm not the girl that was on your mind 
But we can work on it honey 
'til it feels like the very first time 
You lay your hands on me 
I had to beg for more 
Together we turn the key 
Now I'm sure 
You're making love to me like the very first time 
Very first time
