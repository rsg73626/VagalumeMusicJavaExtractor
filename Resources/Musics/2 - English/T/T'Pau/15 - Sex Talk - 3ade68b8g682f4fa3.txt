SEX TALK

I just feel like talking to someone
I don't care who it is
I just wanna have a laugh
You know how it is
All of the day in the same old room
I'm going out of my mind
I can't throw this out of the window
It's mine all mine
You better believe it
Hell, you know I mean it
I've been on my own too long
In desperation I learned many things
But mostly it's to each their own
Sex talk
Intimate strangers
Only sex talking on the phone
Love without a face
I just need a little pat on the back
Tell me that I'm still alive
Like Spider Man
I'm climbing the wall
I want my prize
I don't remember
When it crept up behind me
Don't know when I got so wet
All I know is I was looking for something
But I forget
You see that I can't go on living like this
I've been on my own too long
You know I looked around
Never found love
Far away it called one day
Sex talk
Intimate strangers
Only sex talking on the phone
Love without a face
I don't remember when it crept up behind me
Don't know when I got so wet
All I know is I was looking for something
What was it? What was it? I forget
Oh well, it's easy for you
To be shocked at what I do
You've probably got someone at home
I never had any one to love me
Anyone to need me
I take what I can on the telephone
Sex talk, intimate strangers
Only sex talking on the phone
My kind of love without a face
And we talk oh! ah!
Intimate strangers
Only sex, talking on the phone
Love, love, love without a face
