WITH A LITTLE LUCK

Are you happy now? 
Now you're standing out from the crowd 
Is that a measure of the way you are? 
Got to hear your name out loud 

Well I wonder 
How do you compare? 
Now with the other people living out there 
Tell me, do you only think about yourself 
Or love in a peaceful world 

Don't you hear the angels when they say, 
They say it for you 
Bitter tears will never find a way 

Oh with a little luck baby 
We could wind up in the middle of a little love 
Baby I know 
Take a chance and then maybe 
We could try to work it out 
With a little luck 
Baby I know 
Baby I know 

Get down on your knees 
You better pray for what you seem to believe 
So now is it really what you want the most 
Save a kiss for the Holy Ghost 
Don't you hear the angels when they sing Ave Maria 
Take a chance and then we'll blessed be 

Oh with a little luck baby 
We could wind up in the middle of a little love 
Baby who knows 
Take a chance and then maybe 
We could try to work it out 
With a little luck baby I know 

Don't you hear the angels when they sing Ave Maria 
And then we'll blessed be 

You gotta believe 
With a little luck baby 
We could wind up in the middle of a little love 
Baby I know 
Take a chance and then maybe 
We could try to work it out 
With a little, a little luck 

With a little luck baby 
We could wind up in the middle of a little love 
Baby I know 
Take a chance and then maybe 
We could try to work it out 
With a little luck baby who knows 
Baby I know
