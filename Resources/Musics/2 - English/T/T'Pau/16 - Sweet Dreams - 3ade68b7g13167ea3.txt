SWEET DREAMS

Well this dog is a dog 
And this walk is a hell of a walk 
You see, me and the dog always seem to walk too far 
Now this road is a road 
And this house never leaves me alone 
You see, me and the house never seem to get along 

And the people I meet 
They don't feed my desires 
I never seem to believe my eyes 

Sweet dreams when you go to bed, ooh 
Is your daddy gonna climb into your head 
Oh, oh, Well then you'll never be the same again 
Oh no! Let your momma get you something for the pain 
Yeah! 

Well this hole is a hole 
And I fell to the bottom I know 
You see, me and the hole we don't feel the need to part 

And the things that I've seen 
Would make you want to cry 
You see, I've never been to a place I like 

Sweet dreams when you go to bed 
Is your momma gonna climb into your head 
Oh, oh, Well then you'll never be the same again 
Oh no! Let your daddy get you something for the pain 
Don't say this is paradise! 

And the things that I've seen 
Would make you want to sit down and cry 
I've never been to a place I like 
Don't say this is paradise! 
Sweet dreams! 

Sweet dreams when you go to bed, ooh 
Is your daddy gonna climb into your little head 
Oh, oh, Well then you'll never be the same again 
Oh no! Let your momma get you something for the pain 
Don't say this is paradise! 

Don't say this is paradise 
Don't say this is paradise 
Don't say this is paradise 
Don't say this is paradise 
This ain't your sweet dreams 
Oh no, sweet dreams!
