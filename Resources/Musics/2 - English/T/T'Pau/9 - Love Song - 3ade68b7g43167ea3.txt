LOVE SONG

Something you said has made me realise 
The love I have has cut me open wide 
And I won't ever be the same again 
Won't ever run away again 
No, I'm not afraid to try 
Look into my eyes 
Can't you see that I've been waiting 
I've lived anticipating 

And these arms wait for you 
This heart beats for you 
This breath of love is sweet for you 
This woman incomplete without you 
With each passing day 
We fall into place 

You are the rain to wash away my fears 
You are the sun to dry this veil of tears 
Oh, you make me feel alive again 
You make me wanna smile again 
And I, I need you by my side 
'cause everybody knows 
I was down upon my knees when 
You gave my life a meaning 

And these arms wait for you 
This heart beats for you 
This breath of love is sweet for you 
This woman incomplete without you 

(These arms wait for you) 
Something you said has made me realise 
(This heart beats for you) 
This love I have, it could be ocean's wide 
(This breath of love is sweet for you) 
Oh, don't wanna be alone again 
Won't ever let you go again 
(This woman incomplete without you) 
And I will keep you safe and sound 
Look into your heart 
(With each passing day) 
Can't you see that I've been waiting 
(We fall into place) 
I've lived anticipating 

And these arms wait for you 
This heart beats for you 
This breath of love is sweet for you 
This woman incomplete without you 
With each passing day 
We fall into place 

This heart beats for you 
These arms wait for you 
This breath of love is sweet for you 
This woman incomplete without you 
With each.....
