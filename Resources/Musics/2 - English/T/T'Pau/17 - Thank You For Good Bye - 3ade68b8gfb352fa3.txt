THANK YOU FOR GOOD BYE

Oh woh oh woh oh
Oh ooh oh woh ooh yeah
Hi ah yea
Oh woh oh woh oh
Hi, hi, hooo!

Love turned my head today
I, I turned away
Your smile for all to see
It used to be for me
But you know
You made your bed now you lie in it
And don't come to me
No, don't come to me

Thank you for goodbye
The best thing you ever did for me
Thank you for goodbye
You set me free from my misery
Thank you for goodbye
And every step that I take away
Thank you for goodbye
Is easy today

Hi ah yea
Oh woh oh woh oh
Hi, hi, hooo!

You left me loving you
You did not seem to care
I'm here with someone new
Why do you stare
Cos you know
Our love is dead you leave it be
Don't come to me
Don't come to me

Thank you for goodbye
The best thing you ever did for me
Thank you for goodbye
Set me free from my misery
Thank you for goodbye
And every step that I take away
Thank you for goodbye
Yeah heh!

Thank you for goodbye
The best thing you ever did for me
Thank you for goodbye
Set me free from my misery
Thank you for goodbye
And every step that I take away
Thank you for goodbye

Hi ah yea
Oh woh oh woh oh
