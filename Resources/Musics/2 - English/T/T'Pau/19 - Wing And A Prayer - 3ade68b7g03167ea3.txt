WING AND A PRAYER

Pretty little face 
Don't fit around here no more 
Guess you're in disgrace 
Wild side got the better of you 
Oh, got your face pressed up 'gainst the window pane 
Baby don't give up don't ever walk away 
Got your hand held out 
Dare to ask for more 
You can figure how to open up the door 

With a little luck on a wing and a prayer 
With a lot of love we can make it anywhere 
With a little hope maybe if we dare 
With a little luck we're gonna make it yeah! 

You got a voice and you got taste 
And when you make a choice 
You got a feel for the human race 
Oh, got your head held high 
Looking straight ahead 
Dare to question why they said the things they did 
Wipe away that tear you're not suffering 
Let me make it clear don't ever change a thing 

With a little luck on a wing and a prayer 
With a lot of love we can make it anywhere 
With a little hope maybe if we dare 
With a little luck we're gonna make it 

Life's an open book if you take a look 
Turn the page to find yourself running away 
You can't do it got to work through it 
Keep looking and your heart will show the way 
Your heart will show the way! 

Got your head held high 
Looking straight ahead 
Dare to question why they said the things they did 
Wipe away that tear you're not suffering 
Let me make it clear don't ever change a thing 

With a little luck on a wing and a prayer 
With a lot of love we can make it anywhere 
With a little hope maybe if we dare 
With a little luck we're gonna make it 

With a little luck on a wing and a prayer 
With a lot of love we can make it anywhere 
With a little hope maybe if we dare 
With a little luck you know we'll make it 

With a little luck on a wing and a prayer 
With a lot of love we can make it anywhere 
With a little hope maybe if we dare 
With a little luck you know we'll make it 

With a little luck on a wing and a prayer 
With a lot of love we can make it anywhere 
With a little hope maybe if we dare 
With a lot of love we're gonna make it
