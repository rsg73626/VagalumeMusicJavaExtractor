FRIENDS LIKE THESE

With friends like these
There's no need to worry your head
It seems
They know everything
Hand on the heart
They see how you should feel
But oh how
The mighty all fall down
Heavy in a sea of principles
They drown

They have only one dream
Only one way
With only one vision and
Thought for the day

With friends like these
Woh oh woh
Cautioning the way the world is turning
I want to know
Will they ever, ever see
Or be sure
There's another way
Your mind is working

Now right or wrong
They never walk alone
How lucky are the few
Who know where they belong
For they have...

Only one dream
Only one way
With only one vision and
Thought for the day

There is only (there is only)
One dream (yeah, there is only)
Only one way
With only one vision
Thought for the day (here's your thought for the day)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Your thought for the day (here's your thought for the day)
Your thought for the day
