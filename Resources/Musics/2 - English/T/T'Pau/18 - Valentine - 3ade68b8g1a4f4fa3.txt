VALENTINE

Songs for my valentine
Give the game away
In rhyme I make you mine
Sing all I cannot say
I known mine are the tears I never cry
I know mine is a love I must deny
Songs for my valentine
Give the game away
I see you every day
With happy home and child
I look the other way
Cold on the outside
I know mine are the arms you'll never hold
I know mine is a love remains untold
Songs for my valentine
Oh they give the game away
