LET IT ALL FALL

All the world is watching you 
What you gonna do 
What's your next move 
All the things I see in you 
Will all come true 
If you want them to 
Take off the cloak that defends you baby 
Let it fall to the ground 

Let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall 
Just let it fall away 
Let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall 
Just let it fall away 
Don't have to carry this weight alone 

Call and I will follow you 
Live my dreams through you 
Feel extremes through you 
And I'm waiting in the wings to prove 
I believe in you 
Don't you want me to 
Take down the wall that divides our feelings 
Let it go baby 

Let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall 
Just let it fall away 
Let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall 
Just let it fall away 
Don't have to labour in this love 

One thing you know for certain 
I'll help you carry this burden 
Let it all fall away 

All the world is watching you 
What you gonna do 
What you trying to prove 

Let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall 
Just let it fall away 
Let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall 
Just let it fall away 
Don't have to carry this weight 
Let it, let it, let it, just let it 
Let it all fall, just let it fall away 
Let it all fall away from you 
Oh, let it all fall, just let it fall away 
Let it fall away from you 
Just let it, oh let it fall away 
Oh, let it all fall away from you 
Let it all fall, just gotta let it fall 
Let it fall
