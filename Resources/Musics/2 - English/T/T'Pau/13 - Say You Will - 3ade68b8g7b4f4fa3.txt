SAY YOU WILL

Once in a while you tell me your love is true 
Now and again you hold me like you used to 
Are you looking for another girl 
Who needs the same as you 
Are you looking for another world 
With not so much to lose 

If I live and breathe for you 
Hold back the seas for you 
Oh, say you will, say you will 
Say you will be mine 

I know somebody once tore your world apart 
Slowly I hope I'm mending your broken heart 
If I hold you long enough 
Will you speak the truth 
Am I kissing you deep enough 
To prove this love to you 

If I take a stand for you 
Hold out my hand for you 
Oh, say you will, say you will 
Say you will be mine 

If I live and breathe for you 
I'll hold back the seas for you 
If I take a stand for you 
Say you will, say you will 
Say you will be mine
