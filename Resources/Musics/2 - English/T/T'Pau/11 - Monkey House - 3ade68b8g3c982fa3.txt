MONKEY HOUSE

In the healthy, wealthy state of Mental Hygiene
We will teach you how to think a clean way
There'll be no more dirty looks
And no more dirty books
Now for your own good we will take the choice away
There is a limit in the state of Mental Hygiene
To the difference of opinion we can allow, oh yeah
Now we must close an open mind
If it's open to a different kind
Well, how can you hurt us if we:

Clean up in the Monkey House tonight
Oh yeah, you're gonna be alright
We clean up in the Monkey House, house tonight

Now we can make or break your mind
With Mental Hygiene
And you will see things in the way we think you should
Oh yeah
In the quiet of the night
The first cut is the deepest in the fight
How can you blame us if we:

Clean up in the Monkey House tonight
Oh yeah, you're gonna be alright
We clean up in the Monkey House
We're gonna take you
We're gonna wash you whiter than white
In the Monkey House
Oh yeah!

Woh ooh ooh ooh woh ooh ooh woh
In the quiet of the night
You can hear your own heart beating
In the quiet of the night
We'll take your breath away
Now you're gonna listen to the things we say
We gotta:

Clean up in the Monkey House tonight
Oh yeah, you're gonna be alright
We clean up in the Monkey House
We're gonna take you
We're gonna wash you whiter than white
In the Monkey House tonight
Ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah!
We clean up in the Monkey House
