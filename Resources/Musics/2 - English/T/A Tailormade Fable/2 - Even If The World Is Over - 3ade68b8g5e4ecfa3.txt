EVEN IF THE WORLD IS OVER

My emotion is filled with dont reach anymore.
We walked with holding fingertip.
Always your hand was warm all ways.
But my emotion is filled with dont reach anymore.

I know true meaning you said to me when tears rolled down my heart.

Stay with me. Even if the world is over, surely Im going to love you again.
Im not afraid of anything when I feel you.
Now this emotion becomes a song.

Today from yesterday, endless tomorrow, the connected future.
I know that get something and lose one. I know that what is the most precious for me.

I know true meaning you said to me when tears rolled down my heart.
I swear to the sky I give up the hesitation to this place.

Stay with me. Even if the world is over, surely Im going to love you again.
Im not afraid of anything when I feel you.
Now this emotion becomes a song.
I keep on singing a song.

Stay with me. Even if the world is over, surely Im going to love you again.
Im not afraid of anything when I feel you.
Now this emotion becomes a song.
