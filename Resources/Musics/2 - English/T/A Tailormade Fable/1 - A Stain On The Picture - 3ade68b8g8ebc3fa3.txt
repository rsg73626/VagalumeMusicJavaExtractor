A STAIN ON THE PICTURE

A stain spoils the picture 
Negative, breaks the mood 
A night brings to failure 
Deceiving when it’s you and me 
I’m walking away cause I can’t look at these white pills 
I’m leaving you alone without showing you I disagree 


Forgive and forget 
But there is something that I don’t get 
Opened eyes you slept 
I think I get a little upset

Forgive and forget 
But there is something that I don’t get 
All the words you say 
They make no sense 
I think you’re lost 
In you sentence 
You’re so lost 
Can’t hear anyway what you’re trying to say 


I can’t set the mood 
A white chaperon is in the room 
I can’t feel the heat 
Is there a wall between you and me? 
Is anything wrong? 
Has something fucked up your speech? 
I hate this kiss, it’s white and dry 

Will you lie and fake 
Until I’m pissed with this mistake 
Don’t wake up too late 
Don’t you see that it can all break?

Will you lie and fake 
Until I’m pissed with this mistake
All the words you say 
They make no sense 
I think you’re lost 
In you sentence 
You’re so lost 
Can’t hear anyway what you’re trying to say 

They make no sense 
I think you’re lost 
In you sentence 
You’re so lost 
Can’t hear anyway what you’re trying to say 


There’s a stain on the picture, a brain to repair
