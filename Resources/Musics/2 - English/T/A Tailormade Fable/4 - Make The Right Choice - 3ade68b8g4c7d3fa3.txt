MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE

Look at your past, time has gone so fast
Is it hard to bear? Does it seem unfair?
These pictures on the wall
Why can't you throw them away? (even if their own taste mean so much)

Draw a straight line, as a path to follow
Don't waste your time thinking about tomorrow
These thoughts you won't erase
Are some kind of praise (even if their own taste you feel your soul)                        

Stay still...
Fill in the blanks, set things right
Keep it clear so you can see
It's real...
You are the one who decide
Make it clean so you can shine
Make the right choice

Then try not to be like so many guys
Looking back at their lives
While screaming at their wives
Their feelings are so fake 
That everything might break

So write a script in your head
Make it at night in your bed
Write a list of all your dreams
Begging for them to appear
Forget about tomorrow 
When it's nothing else but sorrow
Please yourself and no one else
Does it matter in the end?

Stay still...
Fill in the blanks, set things right
Keep it clear so you can see
It's real...
You are the one who decide
Make it clean so you can shine 

Stay still...
Fill in the blanks, set things right
Keep it clear so you can see
It's real...
You are the one who decide
Make it clean so you can..
Make the right choice
