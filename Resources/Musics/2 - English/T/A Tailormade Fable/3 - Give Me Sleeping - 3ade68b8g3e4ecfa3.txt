GIVE ME SLEEPING

Sun is bright, Water is cold. Air is fresh, I love you.
Close your eyes, Were taking about tomorrow.
Lets go swimming. You and I are good at playing.

I dont forget when you have gone.
He is more smart than you. He is taller than you.
But its alright. Darlin.

Now I wanna be tasting of your dream.

Changing your mind. Over my head.
Give me break. What youre happened.
Leaving my town again. You said Bull shit
Youre off like a aero plane. We sleep.

Come back my head. I wait in my dream.
