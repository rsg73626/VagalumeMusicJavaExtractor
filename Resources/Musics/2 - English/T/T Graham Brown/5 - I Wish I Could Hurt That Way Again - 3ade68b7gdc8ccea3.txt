I WISH I COULD HURT THAT WAY AGAIN

Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
In between the sorrow at least there always was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

Oh I wish that we could play that game again
Even though I'd always lose and you would win
Times you would desert me how the emptiness would hurt me
But your coming back was always worth the pain
Lord I wish that I could hurt that way again

I'd love to hear you tell me you don't need me anymore
Just like you used to tell me everyday
And I'd love to watch you leaving like a hundred times before
At least my eyes could see you walk away

Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
In between the sorrow at least there always was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
