LOVE IS BLIND

Everybody thinks that they know us 
They say that we're bound for a fall 
Everybody thinks they can show us 
Like some chart on a wall 
But they don't know the way that it's growing in us 
They don't know nothing at all 

Love is blind, I don't need my eyes 
Every last detail I can touch, I read Braille 
Love is deaf, all I need to know is at my finger tips 
Kiss me now, I read lips 

Anywhere that you're leading 
That's where I belong 
If we just trust in feeling 
I know we'll never go wrong 
I don't need to see to believe it 
I just feel my way along 

Love is blind, I don't need my eyes 
Every last detail I can touch, I read Braille 
Love is deaf, all I need to know is at my finger tips 
Kiss me now, I read lips 

When it's dark out you see me through 
Gonna close my eyes, gonna hold on to you 

Love is blind, I don't need my eyes 
Every last detail I can touch, I read Braille 
Love is deaf, all I need to know is at my finger tips 
Kiss me now, I read lips 
Kiss me now, I read lips
