LAST RESORT

I'm glad we took this holiday
At least we got a week or two to stay
Just get away

Away of all the hurrying
Forget about the worrying I like
Just you and I

Now we've come back to try to find
That part of loves we left behind
Can we save our love
Make it the way it was before
Here at the last resort

Remember when we first came here
It doesn't seem like that many years ago
We were so close

Time can erase those memories
But time has been our worse enemy
We both know our love's dying slow

Now we've come back to try to find
That part of loves we left behind
Can we save our love
Make it the way it was before
Here at the last resort

So this is where it all began
Let's don't let this be where it ends

Cause we've come back to try to find
That part of loves we left behind
Can we save our love
Make it the way it was before
Here at the last resort
At the last resort
This is our last resort
