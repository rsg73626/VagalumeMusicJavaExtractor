WINE INTO THE WATER

You've hear a multitude of  prayers on my behalf 
I pray that one more is not too much to ask 
I've tried to fight this battle by myself 
But it's a war that I can't win without your help 

Refrão 
To-night I'm as low as any man can go 
I'm down and I can't fall much farther 
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine 
Now on my knees I'm turning to you father 
Could you help me turn the wine back into water

So many times I've hurt the ones I love 
I pushed them to the edge of giving up 
They've stood by me but how much can they stand 
If I don't put this bottle in you hands 

Refrão
To-night I'm as low as any man can go 
I'm down and I can't fall much farther 
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine 
Now on my knees I'm turning to you father 
Could you help me turn the wine back into water 

I shook my fist at heaven for all the hell that I've been through                       
Now I'm beggin' for forgiveness and a miracle from you,     cause 

To-night I'm as low as any man can go 
I'm down and I can't fall much farther 
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine 
Now on my knees I'm turning to you father 
Could you help me turn the wine back into water 
Could you help me turn the wine back into water 
 

Yeah, yeah
