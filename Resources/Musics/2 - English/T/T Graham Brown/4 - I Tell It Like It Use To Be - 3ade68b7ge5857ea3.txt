I TELL IT LIKE IT USE TO BE

They Say That I'm The Kind Of Person Who Always Speaks My Mind.

To Me There's Nothing Stronger Then The Truth. 
But That's One Thing That I May Never

You Can Ask Me Almost Anything And I'll Tell You Like It Is. 
If They Want To Hear About Our Love And   How It All Went Wrong

But   Darlin' When They Ask Me About You. 
Then Darlin' They Will Just Have To Talk To You

I Tell It Like It Use To Be  When You Were Still In Love With Me 

Before You Got To Use To Me And Wanted Someone New 

I Tell It Like It Ought To Be   'cause How It Is Is Killing Me  

When They Ask About You And Me  I Tell It Like It Use To Be.
