BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONALIST

Lipstick lips that flirt and flatter
Not a word that I hadn't heard before
Till I saw her coming through the door
She let her walking do her talking
She's a brilliant conversationalist

The more she moved the more I was amazed
How gracefully she turned a phrase
Every thought so well expressed
Every line so picturesque
She let her walking do her talking
She's a brilliant conversationalist

She had so many nice things to say
And I had never seen it put quite that way
Her nylons were whispering an invitation
Her high heels provided all the punctuation

I spent the whole night watching her
She had me hanging on her every word
She let me know what she had in mind
I walked her home one step behind
She let her walking do her talking
She's a brilliant conversationalist

She let her walking do her talking
She's a brilliant conversationalist
