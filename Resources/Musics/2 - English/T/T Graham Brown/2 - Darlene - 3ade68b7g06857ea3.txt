DARLENE

Darlene, Sit Down I Need To Talk To You 

Then You Do What You Want To Do 
Just Hear Me Through 

Darlene, You Don't Need No Other Guy 
 
When You Gonna Realize 
 
How Much I Love You 
 
Darlene, You're An Errant Pack Of All You Dreams 
                              I'll Have All I'll Ever Need, If You'll Go With Me 
 
Darlene, Honey I Can Give You Everthing 
                           
I Want You For My Darlin', Darlene 
 
Darlene, We're Both Tired Of Just Hangin' 'round 
                              
Tired Of Dreamin' In This Sleepy Town, The Rest Is History
