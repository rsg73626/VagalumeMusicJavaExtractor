how did this all happen to us?
I don't know if we can fix this
I just can't feel the sweet connection anymore
is this how it's meant to be? I still can't really understand this
it's confusing me, I don't know what to do, Sugar Free

no I'm not saying it's not true, baby I'll be missing you
I'm just missing your smile and everything you did for me
now, maybe it's all gone but I gave you everything
geumaltu pyojeong gachi Hana hana hana hana da

hey Sugar Free
now you are Sugar Free
just to me Sugar Free
everything's Sugar Free
why do you keep going on and on? Can't bear this
please stop breaking my heart

ireoke apeugeman hae dalkomhameul ireobeorin

hey Sugar Free
now you are Sugar Free
just to me Sugar Free
everything's Sugar Free
why do you drag me down so much?
I can't take this no more. Please go away
mandeureo beoryeosseo mueonga ppajeobeorin
just too much here for me that's Sugar Free

what is your plan now?
escalating, moving faster. I can't think straight
at the start, it was sweet but not too bitter, I can bear
can't keep up with your pace no more
I still love you, but you don't so it's confusing me

I don't know what to do Sugar Free

no, I'm not saying it's not true, baby I'll be missing you
I'm just missing your smile and everything you did for me
now, maybe it's all gone but I gave you everything
geumaltu pyojeong gachi Hana hana hana hana da
