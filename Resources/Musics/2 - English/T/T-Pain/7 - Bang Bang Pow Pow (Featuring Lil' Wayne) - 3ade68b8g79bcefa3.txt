BANG BANG POW POW (FEATURING LIL' WAYNE)

My money right, my money money very good (good, good)
Shawty f*ckin’, wassup girl, that head good!
Bang bang pow pow
I do my thang thang
Look at me now now

My money right, my money money cash up
Up up and away, face down, ass up
I rep my town town, that’s where I’m from from
So n*gga pow pow, bom bom

Money to blow, I’m living off tour
Boatloads of cash, b*tch I’m overboard
I got money for these whores if you open up the door
Droppin’ the accounts and they all don’t wanna court
Real talk, I don’t speak, even if it’s “hi hater”
I’m on top and nothing like the elevator
All these b*tches say I’m fly and I can never touch the ground
I’m not tryna be in your circle cause I don’t f*ck around

I get that money, that money (money)
I live it, I want it, drop the top on that Ferrari
Now I’m in California
I let the hard top down and the wind blow through
All I do is win, what the f*ck you gon’ do
Good, good, good
And I do this for my hood, hood, hood
Yeah, and ain’t nobody gonna stop me I’m doing it right now
So bang bang pow pow, everybody say

My money right, my money money very good (good, good)
Shawty f*ckin’, wassup girl, that head good!
Bang bang pow pow
I do my thang thang
Look at me now now

[Lil Wayne]
I go so hard they call me go so hard
You ain’t a king, you a joker card
F*ckin’ up the church money like an alter boy
I got them yellow zanies, at them tonka toys!
I go bonkers boy, I put that on my mom and ‘em
The hoes are all alike, they put the hoe in homonym
I think all these n*ggas sound like me, that’s a compliment
I told a midget b*tch, I do it big hippopotamus
Put that on my Slime and ‘em
No b-ball; we stop and pop
No b-boy we got shit locked
Swagger ill, wassup doc
Make that pussy pop like the gun I went to jail for
Shoot the doors off that jeep, that b*tch look like a mail trunk
Ya pussy keep ya tail tucked, real n*ggas in this b*tch
Get that pussy wet, f*ck her then I jet: Kenny Smith
T-Pain voice, all I do is win and shit
Young money in ya muthaf*ckin’ face; blemishes

My money right, my money money very good (good, good)
Shawty f*ckin’, wassup girl, that head good!
Bang bang pow pow
I do my thang thang
Look at me now now

My money right, my money money cash up
Up up and away, face down, ass up
I rep my town town, that’s where I’m from from
So n*gga pow pow, bom bom
