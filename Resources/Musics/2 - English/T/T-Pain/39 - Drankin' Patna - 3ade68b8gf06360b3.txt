DRANKIN' PATNA

Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me

Hey, shorty so perfect
I'mma buy the bar, got her drinking everything that I drink
Real talk so far
She even thinking everything that I think
And we like the same girl, not the main girl
She been sipping on that black and blue label
You must seen her, I do my thing, girl
I can't let you drink me under this table

She keep thinking just through the heat
And I know that I can't keep up
One more drink and I'mma be there
You gonna see me walk out of this club
Hey, she ain't even drunk yet
She ain't finished that drink yet
Everybody looking at me like I'mma stop you
I've done found me a drinking partner

Oh oh I think I need her to drink a drink with me
I found a girl of my dreams, I've got you
I've done found me a drinking partner
Everybody wanna, wanna
She be sipping that corona, corona
And we aren't turning up in the club without her
I've done found me a drinking partner

I think I'm in love with your cousin
I done seen her take three or four shots already
And we in the club like it's nothing
She walked in and everybody say
(Oh oh here she comes)
Somebody get the shot girl over here right now
(Oh oh here she comes)
Just round them up in front of her
She gonna take them right down

Tonight was so worth it (so worth it)
I done found somebody that like doing
Everything that I do (that I do)
We hit the floor, just like that (like that)
When I move, you move
It's like we the same person (same person)
We drinking even if we ain't thirsty (ain't thirsty)
Screaming yolo in the lane swerving (lane swerving)
I'm 'bout to give it up to your paid service
(Oh oh hey!) I got a feeling she ain't going

Nowhere till she know that she leaving with me (with me)
We drink one more big shot for the night
Shorty, you ain't gonna get no sleep (no sleep)
Hey, we ain't even done yet (done yet)
We ain't even finished this cup yet (cup yet)
And everybody looking at me like I'mma stop you
I've done found me a drinking partner

Oh oh I think I need her to drink a drink with me
I found a girl of my dreams, I've got you
I've done found me a drinking partner
Everybody wanna, wanna
She be sipping that corona-ona
And we aren't turning up in the club without her
I've done found me a drinking partner
I think I'm in love with your cousin
I done seen her take three or four shots already
And we in the club like it's nothing
She walked in (she walked in) and everybody say
Oh oh here she comes
Somebody get the shot girl over here right now
Oh oh here she comes
Just round 'em up in front of her
She gonna take them right down

I think I need her to drink a drink with me
I found a girl of my dreams, I've got you
I've done found me a drinking partner
Everybody wanna, wanna
She be sipping that corona, corona
And we aren't turning up in the club without her
I've done found me a drinking partner
