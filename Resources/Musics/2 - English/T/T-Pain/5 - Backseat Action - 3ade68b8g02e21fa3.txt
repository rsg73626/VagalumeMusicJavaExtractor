Baby u been waiting for you to come home

But we aint did nothing i wanna do
Cuz we done did it in the elevator (been there done that)
Now its time to do it my way (i know you want that)

And pullin your hair wont even compair

Backseat action out in the middle the traffic

Shawty you can call me whenever you need
Working in the excursion, kissing in the expedition

Baby its all gravy, its all good
Cuz we gonna need to open up the back door and let ya legs up
or ima put ya right on the hood
Up and down like an elevator (been there done that)
I know you like to do it my way (i know you want that)

And pullin your hair wont even compair
to what im bout to do to you on this highway
Backseat action out in the middle the traffic
bout to pull over and give you that business

Face Down ass upp thats the way I like it rough
Clouded up acting rough

Rockin it rockin it make it squeek
Stop Stop Stop

So make it fast

Take control make it Swole

Backseat action out in the middle the traffic
bout to pull over and give you that business
Holla at me
