NAKED ON THE DANCEFLOOR

Do your thang Shawty,
Do what you wanna do,
You can dance like this,
Nobody lookin at you,

(Let's Go, Let's Go)

I feel like i can fly high as a kite,
If I can fly high as a kite then i'm gone (I'm gone, I'm gone)
I feel like i can fly high as a bird,
If I can fly high as a bird i'm flying home

But first you gotta
Freeze, then pose
Freeze, then pose
...

[Chrous]
Take your clothes off,
Get naked on the Dancefloor (The Dancefloor)
Take your shoes off,
so you can come and dance some more (Dance some more)

I want you to do it,
do it,

do it,
do it,
do it,
do it,
Now do your thang,
do it,

do it,
do it,

Freeze, then pose
Freeze, then pose
...

[Chrous]
Do your thang shawty,
Do what you wanna do, (Do what you wanna do)
Now you can dance like this, (Dance like this)
Nobody lookin at you, (Nobody lookin at you)

I feel like i can fix my ???????,
If i can fix my ??????,
Then im outta ?????? (I'm gone, I'm gone)

I feel like i can fly like a Plane,
If i can fly like a Plane i'm flying you near,

But first you gotta
Freeze, then pose
Freeze, then pose
...

Get naked on the Dancefloor (The Dancefloor)
