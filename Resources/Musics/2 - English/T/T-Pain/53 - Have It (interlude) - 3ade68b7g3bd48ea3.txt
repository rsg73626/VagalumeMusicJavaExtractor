HAVE IT (INTERLUDE)

Ladies and Gentlemen
You are now in tune to a unknown buffoon
With enough boom in his tune to blow your mind like BOOM
Then you assume that I've done something wrong in my life
But at the same time I'm gonna try to describe the vibe of the world through my eyes
And maybe you won't despise me or try to deprive me of the that respect I need
Oh I see, you don't know that a nigga motor just blow
And I'm walkin by myself talking to myself
up and down the streets when both my feet's is in old shoes
and all these old dudes talking bout
Oh it aint that bad I walked through the snow to school
Bitch we live in Tallahassee, a place where it never snows
But it rains on pain cause [xxx] cant take it
My head is a mailbox and its full and I don't wanna check it
I wanna buy a whole damn car just to wreck it
Cause this fuck nigga told my wife I got two other girls pregnant (damn man)
Now you think I'm gonna change cause my wife cries all night
and I'm not quite the husband type?
You damn right cause I've been livin my whole damn life with all my damn might
and my damn light bill is due and one day I might see you and if I fight with you I can take your life in two ways, the hard way and a bad way cause
if I have a bad day then you might not make it to that
Youngblood's concert (boom boom stomp)
Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sorry if I'm losin you
but I'm just sick and tired of tryin to get mine
so don't come to me with your 23's with that fake-ass smile
smoking on your black and mild cause all the wild I know what your sayin in your head, this nigga go stronger than me, longer than me, but he ain't never gonna be shit cause everything belongin to me.
See I refuse to be abused and misused and accused of not payin' my dues
I am not a crack addict but if you want everything I got, you gonna get it cause imma let yo ass have it
Yeah, ok now, what you do is, marinate on that

Ahoooooooooo (x 4)
