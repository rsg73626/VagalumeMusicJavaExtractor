NOTHIN'

You niggas ain't nothing, nothing, nothing
See me undercover fist poppin' with your cousin
Pull up to the club, let you hear the speakers bump
With a honey in the hummer got her cumming on my thong
I get second to none, drummer steady drumming
And I don't need keys, I'm just stumping on the button
Shawty want my lovin' she not thinking of the others

So I told her get in line, she can come and take a number
She looking at my pocket
like she getting something from me
And if she thinks she is then this bitch is really dumb
And I'm a boss, get lost, maybach, rick ross
I'm looking for a chick with the ability
to get that booty jumping
You see what I got kicking put my meat up in that oven
And when it's all over, you can get ready for supper
They say that I'm a porn star, call me t pumper

Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
What you say
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
What you say
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Hey I got you shakin' that thing like
Hell no, hell no
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her sittin' here fucking like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'

Hey look at this motherfuckin' rug that I'm cutting
These bitches act sedated
but these chickens steady clucking
Like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'
And they don't give a fuck if I'm up in the maserati
Or I'm ducking in the bucket and I love it
Big chain, teddy p, t-pain, that's me
I do my thang, 28's turning lane

They see me with a couple bad bitches
and they know I keep it trucking
Bottle of that drink and I'm feeling kinda lucky
And if they're playing games it's the deuces that I'm talking
Cause they know why they came
they ain't fucking, nigga fuck them
In the hood, wassup? Damn right you gonna let a nigga cut
Fo' sho', me no, teddy playin' from the a50 plus
a nigger ain't

Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
What you say
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
What you say
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Hey I got you shakin' that thing like
Hell no, hell no
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her sittin' here fucking like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'
