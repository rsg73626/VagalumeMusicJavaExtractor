SHAWTY

[plies talkin:]
What's happenin homie dis ya boy plies man hey pain tell 'em
Bout your shawty ima tel em bout mine

[chorus: t-pain]
Even though i'm not your man, you not my girl
Ima call you my shawty
Cause i can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
Cause you my shawty
Babygirl you know i be home, keep me on the ringtone shawty
Sing it to me girl

[verse 1: plies]
Soon as i seen her, shit told her i'd pay for it
Lil mama the baddest thing 'round here & she already know it
I pointed at the donk & told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks & told her i'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her i was a real nigga & she went for it
First time i caught her shit, she aint even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, i got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
& opened her up & showed her what a real nigga like
I told her i don't usually do this, i don't fuck on the first night
Cause after i beat ya baby i'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil bust it baby cause she keep it tight
Whenever i tell her to bust, aint gotta tell her twice
Whenever i wanna get off she know how to get me right

[chorus: t-pain]
Even though i'm not your man, you not my girl
Ima call you my shawty
Cause i can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we aint did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
Cause you my shawty
Babygirl you know i be home, keep me on the ringtone shawty
Sing it to me girl

[x2:]
Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy

[verse 2: plies]
I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her
Know why they wanna beat bae, look at all that ass on her
Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged & bend the [corner ?]
She proud to be fuckin me, cause i'm stuntin on her
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga don't'uh
Aint called her in 2 days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
Thats why i don't mind breakin her off, cause she aint with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause i done beat her under
Bae snatchin down there, i'm tellin ya, i promise
I exposed her to real, & now she hate lames
Member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thing
Ever since i ran up in shawty she ain't been the same

[chorus: t-pain]
Even though i'm not your man, you not my girl
Ima call you my shawty
Cause i can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we aint did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
Cause you my shawty
Babygirl you know i be home, keep me on the ringtone shawty
Sing it to me girl

[x2:]
Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy
