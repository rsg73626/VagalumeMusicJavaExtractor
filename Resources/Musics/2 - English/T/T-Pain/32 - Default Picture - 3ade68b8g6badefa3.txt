DEFAULT PICTURE

Whoaaaa whoaaaa

Hey, I got a feelin in my bones that I can't get rid of, but that's prolly the base.
Can't get this picture out of my mind,
that I seen on twitter, the one of your face.
Girl I'm just tryna see if you feel just a lil like me.
So DM me back, don't do me like that.

I wanna see ya pretty ass in person girl, but that's just not the case.
Cause I'm way on the other side of the earth & girl plane tickets to high for me to pay.
Im just tryna see if you feel just a lil like me, so you can give me a call, I ain't doin' nothin' at all.


(Girl you keep) tweetin what you doin'.
Postin pictures & I feel like I need to be posted with ya'
Laid up in the bed somewhere, smearin make up, messin up your hair.
(Girl you keep) makin' me spend my time, checkin on yo chat line.
You make me say oohhh oohhhh yeahhh yeah.

Im falling in love with ya default picture

You don't never show up in my mentions girl, just say my name.
Must be something with my eyes or my iphone5, or is this even yo page.
I'm just tryna see if you got any interest in me, or am I botherin you?
Should I be unfollowing you?

You be acting like that dude in ya picture is your boyfriend
But I know its just a face
Let me show you that I'm better then him, just name the time & place
Girl you gotta see that here is where I should be
And girl you can give me a call, I just wanna talk to you that's all

(Girl you keep) tweetin what you doin'.
Postin pictures & I feel like I need to be posted with ya'
Laid up in the bed somewhere, smearin make up, messin up your hair.
(Girl you keep) makin' me spend my time, checkin on yo chat line.
You make me say oohhh oohhhh yeahhh yeah.

Im falling in love with ya default picture
