ALL I NEED (ONE NIGHT)

Verse 1
I was just chillin in the club me
And my crew buyin out the bar you know how we do
Then the dj let the people know teddy pain in the house
Then I locked eyes with this pretty thang
She waved at ya boy and said hey t-pain
Im feelin fresh got the brand new disco ball in my mouth
Grabbed her by the wrist had to pull her back
I just wanna tell her this
I'm not trying to be mean and I'm not trying to be ruude
But this is a strip club and baby I'm just almost tipped up
And I just want this last lap dance but only from u

Chorus
And she started poppin
She started rollin and poppin that pussy
And she turned around she leaned over
And asked me was I really in love with a stripper
And I said no but baby its possible
She bent over and she started poppin mo
And I said shawty we can come to my crib
U know jus how it iz
We can do this here over and over again
All I need is one night (one night)
I got 1 rubber
Ya day time friend and ya late night lover
Even though ya bodys tight
Baby sho u right
All I need is one night (one night)

Verse 2
Got her with this gurl that went to my school
Told her lets get up and she said thats cool
Cuz she been waitin 4 a long time to see
What the teddy about
Grabbed her by the wrist whispered in her ear
U cant leave me like this
I'm not trying to be mean and im not trying to be ruude
But I know u been drinkin (drinkin)
And I kinda been thinkin (thinkin)
It'll be nice if u gave me a lap dance right in my car

Chorus
And she started poppin
She started rollin and poppin that pussy
And she turned around she leaned over
And asked me was I really in love with a stripper
And I said no but baby it's possible
She bent over and she started poppin mo
And I said shawty we can come to my crib
U know jus how it iz
We can do this here over and over again
All I need is one night (one night)
I got 1 rubber
Ya day time friend and ya late night lover
Even though ya body's tight
Baby sho u right
All I need is one night one night one night one night
