CITY NIGHT

The women and the weather is great
In California,
I love the street clubs in the A
Oh, it's raining on ya
When I'm in Vegas, parties like crazy
I love the ladies in need of my aid and,
Charlestown? is hot now, Houston is hot now
And I love New York
And all the city nights

Night life, life light
Sleep all day, party all night
City lights, city nights,
Tryin to see what your city like (man)
Brooklyn, Detroit, Boston,
Seattle Denver, Austin,
Dc, St. Louis, Milwaukee,
Keep the people talkin
Par-Par-Par-Partyin with girls,
I like partyin with girls
Gettin lost in this world,
So damn drunk we might just hurl
In Orlando, Chicago, everywhere that I go
Reno, Vegas, Tahoe,
I've been there, trust me, I know

The women and the weather is great
In California,
I love the street clubs in the A
Oh, it's raining on ya
When I'm in Vegas, parties like crazy
I love the ladies in need of my aid and,
Charlestown? is hot now, Houston is hot now
And I love New York
And all the city nights

Flight time, bright time,
Meet me at the airport
Bout to get up out the country,
Stamp my Louie passport.
Last night was amazing,
Can't tell you Brazil was Vegas
But I almost missed my flight.
Aww, man, that woulda been a crazy
Corner bout in Brazil,
Sonar in Barcelona,
Woke up in South Africa,
Back to California
I love the bay
I love La
Let's spread that real Cali love all day

The women and the weather is great
In California,
I love the street clubs in the A
Oh, it's raining on ya
When I'm in Vegas, parties like crazy
I love the ladies in need of my aid and,
Charlestown? is hot now, Houston is hot now
And I love New York
And all the city nights

Take me out to the city
London, Dubai, Paris, and Rome
Take me out to the city
Make me feel like I don't ever wanna go home
Take me out to the city
T-t-take me out to the city
T-t-take me out to the city
London, Dubai, Paris, and Rome
Take me out to the city
Make me feel like I don't ever wanna go home
(Echoes)
M-m-make me feel like I don't ever wanna go home
(Echoes)
Make me feel like I don't ever wanna go home

The women and the weather is great

I love the street clubs in the A
Oh, it's raining on ya

And I love New York
