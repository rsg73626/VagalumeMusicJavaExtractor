DROWING AGAIN (FEATURING ONE CHANCE)

Waves upon waves keep me down
And I can’t get to the top
But when I get there I’ll still be nowhere
Cause I ain’t find the one I love
And if I make it out
Then we shouldn’t talk about how you left me
Just how you left me drowning again
Drowning again yeah
Drowning again yeah

You should come see how good it would be
To come drown with me ooh ooh
Days upon days I’ve been floating
And you don’t care if I die or not
But when I’m deceased I hope you will be
Dying next to me in my watery grave
And before we go I just want my baby to know
How it feels to be

Drowning again yeah
Drowning again yeah
Drowning again yeah

You should come see how it good it would be
Heyy ahhh ooh
Ooh ooh
Drowning again ooh in your love
Drowning again ooh in your love
Drowning in your love again
Ooh in your love

Drowning again in your love
Drowning again in your love
Drowning again in your love
Uuh drowning again in your love
Drowning again in your love
