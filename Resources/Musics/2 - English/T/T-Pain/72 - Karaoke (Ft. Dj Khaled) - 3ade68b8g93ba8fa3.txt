[T-Pain]
I got up out da streets
So I ain't gotta steal
but listen to the radio, it's obvious I still kill
But y'all was in the game way before me
so why you wanna do some shit I did in '03
I'm layin low key, for a long time
But don't act like you know me, this is the wrong time
so grab ya microphone, set yo auto tune
and I'ma bust a verse on you ass like I outta do
I ain't no gangsta dude
Ain't got a poppin' banga
but you know I'm powerful when I'm pissin off the gospel singas
I'm tryin ta feed my kids y'all niggas can die slowly
Cause to me, it sound like a bunch of karaoke

[DJ KHALED]
Ay yo!
F**k the imposter.
F**k these karaoke niggas man,
T-Pain, they wanna live you life man
These are bitch ass niggas man
It's the DJ khaled, nappy boys
I'm goin in! I'm goin in!
Ay yo, T-Pain

[T-PAIN (DJ Khaled)]
You know what Khaled,
I know you right now.
Let me get em again, though.
...
(Talk to Them)
Ay Ay listen
It ain't all bad, some of you please me
But the only niggas that's cool is Kanye and Lil Weezy
I'm a hit maker, not a comedian
So why da f**k would these niggas laughing at me when I seen their ass
This shit will never work or one hit wonder bitch
Bet all the shit that you do and not make me one of this
Now why its cool for you but it's not for me
And why you ain't hop on my song and make it hot for me.
But you don't give a f**k.
You're just a swagger jacker
Now I'm a certified lamborghini-st and cadillac-er
Cuz I'm tryin to feed my kids.
Y'all niggas can die slowly
Cuz just to me, it sound like a bunch of karaoke

[DJ Khaled (T-Pain)]
You're singing the same old song
You're some karaoke niggas
Karaoke f**k niggas
This is Nappy Boy
This is DJ Khaled
We Global with this hood shit
This is what we do
Why you wanna live our life
You wanna live our life, STOP
Ay yo T-Pain,(What Up Khaled)
Get Em

[T-PAIN]
Let me get a moment of silence
For the late great groud that trout me
Y'all niggas ain't holdin' 'em down
So we had to put me at you
Bitch, I'm Teddy Pain, the son of Teddy Riley
The father of the game, you pussy niggas wiley
How many niggas really wanna test,
Pain he originate I gotta be the best
Hundred motherf**kers tryin to do what I dids
Till a fool from a infant, style from a kid
24 Years, 24 Cars
Bitch we the best, we got many more star
Every time you pussy motherf**kers try to stop me
There's been a more hits, been a more bars


Yayyy. That's not cool baby
So that's not happenin'
Y'all keep on stealing from me
Let me try this rappin' thing
I know you know I hear you
Isn't that embarassing
Set the game on fire,
Teddy got some ling


Pussy niggas step up if you really got good game
I gotta lot of shit to say about a nigga,
but it's really not good thangs
It ain't no disrespect man, y'all keep doing your shit
But my daughter told me to tell you to get off of daddy's dick

Ay yo Pain man
I'ma call this niggas out
I'ma pull them skirts man
They f**k.
Ay yo Let me get 'em
F**k it
It's the DJ Khaled
Big dog pitbull Terror Squadian
