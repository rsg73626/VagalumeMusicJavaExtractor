OKAY TO SMILE

I'm losing touch with everybody
Oh, what a sound it makes
It's bruising up my inner body
Oh, what a time to pray
Oh, but I see the bright side

And I know it's okay to smile now, now now
OOh you gotta be the light side
Every once in a while now
Ooh ooh
I'm losing touch with everybody
Ohh so easy now
Cause I'm so used to lovin'
Then all the sudden stoppin'

Ooh please don't leave me now, now, now
Ooh but you gotta see the bright side
Then you'll know its okay to smile now, now, now
You gotta be the light side
Every once in a while now
Just every once in a while now
OOhh while now now now
Every once in a while now
Just every once in a while now
