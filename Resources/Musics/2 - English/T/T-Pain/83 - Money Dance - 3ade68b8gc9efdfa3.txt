MONEY DANCE

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
 Right off top money go in the air
 And she said it didn't matter if it go in her hair
 If your shoes cost a thousand then I'm blowing a pair
 I throw five over here and throw the rest over there
 Yeah, homie I done got my own shit
 Rollin' through your stop signs where you going bitch
 Holla at my nigga Boogie and Brownsville
 Like I done turn my New York accent
 Ahhhh shit!

 What's the deally son, really son
 It's the nigga Teddy Pain illy son, feel me son
 That's all I'm hearing when I come to the east
 Plus I got the beast niggas when it comes to the beast
 Young Fyre, Bishop Jones and especially me
 I cook anything that come to me especially beef
 Check the 6th and 7th letter of the alphabet and trust me dawg
 You don't wanna F with a G

[Hook: One Chance]
 If you get money like this
 Throw a couple racks in the sky like this
 Hunnit thang up pop a bottle like this
 Now errbody stop... and do the money dance

[T-Pain:]

[Verse 2:]

[Hook: One Chance]
 If you get money like this
 Throw a couple racks in the sky like this
 Hunnit thang up pop a bottle like this
 Now errbody stop... and do the money dance

[T-Pain:]
 And they be like...
