1000 MILES

Why are my keys in your hand? why, why?
You say you don't want me as a man, ha, ha
Oh, oh, oh, ha, ha,
We can make up if you want to,
... you can drive my toyota anymore, not even tell the story
And I believe I

I will walk 1000 miles,
Then I will walk 1000 more
Just to be the man who walked 2000 miles.
It may take me a while, but I'm running,
I'm running, I'm running!
I'm running no matter how far you gonna get me babe!...
I'm running, I'm running!
I'm running no matter how far you gonna get me babe!...

Don't make it...
For tell him that you need...
Let it roll,... she is gone!
Cause you ain't driving my civic,
When all them get away girls wanna...
And I believe I

I will walk 1000 miles,
Then I will walk 1000 more
Just to be the man who walked 2000 miles.
It may take me a while, but I'm running,
I'm running, I'm running!
I'm running no matter how far you gonna get me babe!...
I'm running, I'm running!
I'm running no matter how far you gonna get me babe!...
