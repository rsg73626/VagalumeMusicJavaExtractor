SEPARATED

We would always have the ability to start off right (right)
By the end of the night we end up in a fight (whoa)
Girl you said you'd never leave me, but you might
This time, this time, this time

We was doing so damn good for so damn long
But as you can see something went terribly wrong (whoa)
I been through this so I can stay strong
This time, this time, this time
Separated, separated, separated, separated

Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow will never be no more of
Separated

Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow will never be no more of
Separated

We would always have the ability to pull it back together 
(Gether, gether, gether)
And you was always down for me, 
You ain't give a fungress to whateva (evaaa...)
But now you're here telling me that you deserve betta
This time, this time (this time)
Hey, and now im sitting here in the dark with nobody
And I don't wanna be alone I need my shawty
Cause luxury means nothing without the luxury of love

We're separated, separated, separated, separated
Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow there will be no more of
Separated

Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow there will be no more of (hooo hooo ooooh)
Separated
