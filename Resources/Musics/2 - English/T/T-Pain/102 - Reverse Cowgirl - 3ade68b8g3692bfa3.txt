REVERSE COWGIRL

Hey Nah 
Hey Nah 
Hey Nah 

Welcome to my rodeo 
Hold on to me 
Baby I'mma take it slow 
How you ride is the key 

We gonna go left, right, front, back 
That ain't just enough 
I can take you everywhere 
All around the world 
I like how you do it 
Just put it in Reverse Cowgirl 
Get it up, get it up,pump it up girl 
Set it up, set it up 
I like how you do it, do it, do it 
Just put your hands in the air 
Wave 'em around and go yee haw, yee haw 
Put your hands in the air 
Wave 'em around and go yee haw, yee haw 

Baby let me rope you up 
Tie you down 
Do it right 
No matter how hard you buck 
Gonna get wild all night 

Girl, you looking like a nine 
Where I'm from that's a neener 
N ya she got that trunk space 
Remind me of my Beemer 
Yeah right, that 760, not that 745 
Like the way you back it up 
Even might to let ya try 
Get jail, no bail 
Worried because I'm high risk 
I'm the type to ride and listen to his own shit 
She like the way I write the track 
I'm trying to pull the tracks out 
Young gon' to be a chiropractor 
I'm 'bout to check her back out 
Told 'em like the feds 
Take a picture, I don't give a fuck 
We can do it anywhere 
Even in my Caddy trunk 
Yeah, you know she thoroughbred 
Me, I gets that thorough brea d 
Girls just say she's so smart 
That's why I call her thorough head 

(Chorus)
