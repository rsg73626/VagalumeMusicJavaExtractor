ONE MORE DRINK

Intro
(Car pulls off, tires screech)

Verse 1

(Ludacris)
It was Friday night and I was feelin' aight (Yep)
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights,
Mixin' Henney wit da Sprite while I'm drinkin' and drivin',
No police lights, no police sirens,
I'm headed to da club, lookin' fo' a freak,
To spread a lil' love and spread a couple cheeks,
Pull up to da spot, 26's like bam!
Eyes on me like "Bitch, do you see him?"
Stroll through the front door, headed to the VIP,
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips,
Scopin' out da room and what do I see?
A nice round butt and a pair of double D's,
So I crept up like "Shawty, what's happen'n?
You kilin' dat dress and I love it wit' a passion,"
Den she turned around and her face was aight,
She had a gap tooth and mean overbite,
But I was like hmm...

(T-Pain)
Chorus
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f***in' you,
Is that watchu wanna do, shawty?
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f***in' you,
You too.

Verse 2
(Ludacris)
Woke up da next mornin' and all I can remember,
Was takin' shots and tippin' da bartender,
Surrender to da woman, end up bringin' me home,
Cause' she started lookin' better every shot of Patron (Yep)
I jumped up wit a devilish grin,
Cause' tonight damn right! I might do it again!
So I called up da homies (What up?)
Let's ride, we can hit the sportsbar,
Over on the South side,
Get a couple of Coronas, couple of limes,
Went up to da bar, saw a couple of dimes,
So I, slowly walked up an said "Hi,"
My name is Ludacris and I'mma hell of a guy,
One said "I know who you are, I'm your #1 fan,
And right now it's too bad I got a man,"
And I said "I understand, but where da hell is he at?
Cuz, in a minute if he don't show up then maaaaan....."

(T-Pain)
Chorus
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f***in' you,
Is that watchu wanna do, shawty?
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f***in' you,
You too.

(Ludacris)
Uh huh,
Ay Pain, holla at em right quick man!

(T-Pain)
You gon' get in trouble wit yo' man, girl,
(Don't get in trouble, girl)
Talkin 'bout how you're my biggest fan, girl,
(I know it, I know it)
Now I don't wanna do,
(Please)
What you gon' make me do,
(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
But... if I have one more drink...

Verse 3
(Ludacris)
One more drink I'mma get cha,
Home, then I'll split cha,
Grab the camera phone,
And take a buncha drunk pictures,
Cause' Hennessy mixed wit a whole bunch of Buddha,
Equals you mixed wit a whole bunch of Luda,
And you know how far one drink could go,
Start slurrin' my speech, slowin' up da FLOOW,
Hikin' up yo' skirt, climbin' up yo' shirt,
It's Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt,
So guess what babygurl?

(T-Pain)
Chorus
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f***in' you,
(Just one mo')
Is that watchu wanna do, shawty?
(That's all it's gonna take)
If I take one more drink,
(Hey!)
I'm gon' end up f***in' you,
(Haha, who else T-Pain?)
You too.

(Outro)

(Ludacris)
You hear what I'm sayin'?
People too picky these days, dammit!
Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny,
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminating,
This is been a Luda Service Announcement...

Deuces...
Hahahahahaha.
