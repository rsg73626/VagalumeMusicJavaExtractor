She working honest but she say it's on a temporary
It's been 3 years and she's still here and I was getting scary
Say she don't wanna dance forever 
I look at her with my face like
Why? why?
She supersexy everybody wanna know 'bout her
And when that everybody
Because the way she get it in, all of the man and the women
I'll try, I'll try

Shawty so incredible
Body language she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
That she doesn't even know it
Little mama understand
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And I know you probably get whatever from whatever man
Shawty do what's in your soul
Still it be a shame to see you go

Cause the way you move, uh, uuhuu
Girl the way you move
Girl you got them like uuhh
Girl the way you move (Boy Wonder, Wonder)
Girl you're so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
Girl the thangs you do
Girl you keep them like uuhh
Baby I love the way you move
If this club was the sky
You're the brightest star
You like playing fair starting on that pole like
What? drop a couple stacks on you that's none
Hundred after hundred a nigger ain't fronting
Wait in the club then I ain't come

Said she tired of all that bullshit
Gonna quit the game, change your life and ease your pain
Hold up, work so hard it's time to play
Baby girl take it off the tray

Shawty so incredible
Body language she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
That she doesn't even know it
Little mama understand
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And I know you probably get whatever from whatever man
Shawty do what's in your soul
But it be a shame to see you go

Cause the way you move, girl, uh, uuhuu
Girl the way you move (they way you do, incredible)
It's the way you move
Girl you're so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
And the thangs you do
Girl you got them like uuhh
Baby I love the way you move

I never felt like this before
Which is why I brought some friends along to help me express it
A little better
Got one more friend who I wanna talk to
Who have more experience in this department
Pain, talk to her

I never seen nobody work it quite just like you baby
I gotta tell you I'm starting to like you baby
And it's crazy cause you don't wanna be here
I see it in your eyes, eyes
Start listening to them girls into the locker room
Just keep doing your thang, don't let them stop you, boo
And if you heard some things about me
Girls they're all lies, lies

She looks so incredible
Body language she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
That she doesn't even know it

The more I drink the more you look like wife material
If you ready to row with me girl, here we go
You hit the stage and then you make the music stop
Then your booty go, left cheek, right cheek

Girl I love the way you move
Got me like uuh
Girl I love the way you move, whoa
Girl I love the way you move
Girl you're so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
It's the thangs you do
Girl you keep them like
Baby I love the way you move

Baby don't go, don't
Baby don't go, don't
Baby don't go, don't
