MY GIRL GOTTA A GIRLFRIEND

Oh oh oh eww eww eww eww (I know what you like) 
Oh oh oh eww eww eww eww (Convict) 

[Verse 1:] 
I just got home from work its 1:30 
I'm kinda hungry cuz i know my girl lonely 
Goin back to my crib its kinda early 
Surprised my girl because i know she waitin 
I opened the front door I hear moanin 
Fa real somebody im fittin kill somebody 
Then i get closer i hear groanin 
Bust in the door and see my girl wit a chick 
Thats when i know that 

[Chorus] 

My girl gotta girlfriend 
I just found out but its aight 
Long as i can be wit her too 
My girl gotta girlfriend 
It really is not a problem 
Cuz imma make it do what it do 
Cuz havin 2 chicks is better than no chicks 
I'd rather just join in 
Keep my girl and keep the other one too 
My girl gotta girlfriend 
It really is not a problem 
Cuz imma make it do what it do 

[Verse 2:] 
Do you know your problem shawty 
Could of told me 
That you was sleepin wit a chick 
How the hell you gon be leavin me out 
I thought we was better shawty 
You so stingy 
While you was kissin on it 
I could behind her dribben baby 
Talkin bout I be wack girl 
But im so cool wit it 
Both of yall in my bed 
Watch what im doin 
Girl imma fool wit it 
Imma fool wit it 
So slide over for me shawty 
Let me show ya how a player get down 
Cuz girl im bout to give ya both the business 
Beat it up until ya say ya finished 
Then off to the other one 
Got em bustin like a gun 
So i dont really care that 

[Chorus] 

My girl gotta girlfriend 
I just found out but its aight 
Long as i can be wit her too 
My girl gotta girlfriend 
It really is not a problem 
Cuz imma make it do what it do 
Cuz havin 2 chicks is better than no chicks 
I'd rather just join in 
Keep my girl and keep the other one too 
My girl gotta girlfriend 
It really is not a problem 
Cuz imma make it do what it do 

[Break] 

Oh oh oh eww eww eww eww (Convict) 
O O O O oh oh oh eww eww eww eww (Convict) 
O O O O Imma have ya singin 
You gon be singin (eww shawty) 
Imma have ya singin 
I know what ya like 
Imma have ya singin 
You gon be singin (hey shawty) 
Imma have ya singin 
I know what you like 

[Chorus] 

My girl gotta girlfriend 
I just found out but its aight 
Long as i can be wit her too 
My girl gotta girlfriend 
It really is not a problem 
Cuz imma make it do what it do 
Cuz havin 2 chicks is better than no chicks 
I'd rather just join in 
Keep my girl and keep the other one too 
My girl gotta girlfriend 
It really is not a problem 
Cuz imma make it do what it do girl
