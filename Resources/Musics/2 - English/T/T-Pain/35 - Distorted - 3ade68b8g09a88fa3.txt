DISTORTED

{Where is everybody}
{Don’t stop now}

{Don’t stop now}

Hey, yeah
I don’t really wanna do nothing today
Just wanna do you tonight (you tonight)
And the only way that I’ll be satisfied is if I do you right (do you right)
I want you to feel it coming
Stronger longer
If f**king you ain’t a right then a dude then I can’t get no wronger

I’m pulling hair slapping derrières
All you gotta do is say {Don’t stop now}
And I won’t I promise this
I’m gone be the dominant one
I got you bitch squeeze that pillow bite that shit
Uhh it feel good don’t it tell me that you want it
Shawty call me daddy {Don’t stop now}

Don’t stop it stop it don’t stop it
Stop it don’t stop it stop it don’t stop it
Stop it don’t stop it stop it don’t stop it
Stop it don’t stop it stop it don’t
Don’t stop now

Girl I don’t really know what else I can say
But baby girl you look tight (you look tight)
And I’m sitting right here looking in your eyes and they’re telling me everything you might like (you might like)
I want you to feel it coming
From a bigga nigga
I’m not what you’re used to f**king with (oh no)
I’m a little bit thicker

I’m pulling hair slapping derrières
All you gotta do is say (Don’t stop now)
And I won’t I promise this
I’m gone be the dominant one
I got you bitch squeeze that pillow bite that shit
Uhh it feel good don’t it tell me that you want it
Shawty call me daddy {Don’t stop now}

Don’t stop it stop it don’t stop it
Stop it don’t stop it stop it don’t stop it
Stop it don’t stop it stop it don’t stop it
Stop it don’t stop it stop it don’t
Don’t stop now
