LOST & FOUND

Lost found
Lost found
Lost found
Hey
Lost found
What ever
What ever
What ever
Hey

What is this place how many days have I been here
Is this outer space how the hell did I get here
And I even knew it talking the air is to thin
How many shots did I take why is there 
eight glasses in front of me
So I get up walk around I see so many people get down
I see girls I see thugs and I realize I'm still in the club
Where's the nova where's my cup I guess me 
and my girl broke up
Again cause I'm always in the bin the bin of the lost and found

This is the spot where you're going when you just lost your girl
Lost and found
Take a shot up if you wanna step into the world
If I lose one I get two and you know just what we gonna go do
Come to my place get down have just your girlfriend 
come through the lost and found

What ever
What ever

If I lose one I get two and you know just what we gonna go do
If this is a test I'm gonna commit me a sin yeah
And I saw her face and she creases a little baby come 
and this is just a little thing come closer
In my space now I'm completely in trance mode
Dj turn up the base I still got eight glasses in front of me
So we get up walk around and shorty's still breaking it down
We saw girls we saw thugs I'm so glad I woke up in this club
Here's my nova here's my cup yes it me and this girl break up
I get a friend cause I'm always in the bin
The bin of the lost and found

This is the spot where you're going when you just lost your girl
Lost and found
Take a shot up if you wanna step into the world
If I lose one I get two and you know just what we gonna go do
Come to my place get down have just your girlfriend 
come through the lost and found

What ever
What ever
What ever
When you go through the lost and found
Lost found
Go through the lost and found
Lost found
When you go through the lost and found
Lost found

This is the spot where you're going when you just lost your girl
Lost and found
Take a shot up if you wanna step into the world
If I lose one I get two and you know just what we gonna go do
Come to my place get down have just your girlfriend 
come through the lost and found
