IT AIN'T ME

T-Pain ft T.I. and Akon

[T-Pain]
Yeah, Yeah

[Intro: T.I]

Ay, it's for all my cats man
Have you ever been in a club and have a chick run up on you,
and kinda tell you to buy her a drink, home?
I mean, it ain't what I can do, it what I will do,
and attitude is everythang, you know what I’m sayin’
I mean, a chick who ask for nothing will get everything
A chick who ask for everything will get nothing
Pain, why don't you talk to these motherf**king broke bitches for a minute, would you

[T-Pain]

You may want a man with some consideration (Consideration),
Determination (Determination)
I let conversation (How you Doing Baby?)
And you might want a man who just say straight I'm nasty (Straight I'm nasty)
From Tallahassee (It's a hate 5-0)
You're far to classy (far too classy)
So you might want a little who’s got a job (job), car (car), clothes (clothes), jewelry (jewelry)
Girl I just ain't fooling me to you (NO), to you (NO)
Think I'm that easy shawty, it can't go that breezy shawty,
Find another dude cuz it ain't me

[Chorus: T-Pain]

What you in a rain, buy expensive thangs
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uhh
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
I saw all your fingas take you out and make you famous
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uhh
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,

[Akon]

I know you thought you had a sugar daddy
Plan to treat me like a her
Take my money cuz I'm attractive
Then kick me off to the curve
Climb in fancy restaurants
Eating expensive audorbs
How I'm gonna let you get it all like that
Without the big lip
Girl that's my word.
And if you wanna ride, then I just can't let it slide
If you plan to get me for all I got, you could start by spending the night.
Otherwise let me see your head get small
Less your head to make the head get tall
If not gon get lost cuz that ain't me
(If not gon get lost cuz that ain't me)

[Chorus: T-Pain]

What you in a rain, buy expensive thangs
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uhh
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
I saw all your fingas take you out and make you famous
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uhh
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,

[T.I.]

Hey,

Shawty look so good
So she think I should
Throw dough to her, like it ain't nothi’n to it
Get you whatever you like, I could,
But all I be givin’ you tonight is just wood
Hood, to my heart I do it
Huge and your attitude just blew it
So rude that your mentality is distorting your reality
Actually the more you speak make me think where I'd rather be
I don't care if you hiding me, cuz I won't sponsor shopping sprees
It's lot of freaks I could be showing my generosity, to
Boo, stop it please, I ain't that guy,
You ain't that fly
Got your head up your ass that's why
All you ask for is all I deny
I do for you what I decide
And I can buy all kinds of things
Go places spend all kinds of dough
My kindness is no bland this dough
T-Pain, where you find this hoe
Ha ha, I know what you want me to do

[Chorus: T-Pain]

What you in a rain, buy expensive thangs
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uhh
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
I saw all your fingas take you out and make you famous
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uhh
It ain't me babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
