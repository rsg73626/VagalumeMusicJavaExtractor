U gotta believe me I int telin no lies girl 
Layback n enjoy girl its time to make love 

[?] 
Baby girl I said I love ya (love ya) 
All I want in dis world is ur love and to hold ya 
I don�t care what the people say about 
About my long distance relationship outta town 
But girl ur the stars in my sky 
Girl u stole my heart and I cant even lie 
I appreciate u for changing my world 
N I promise dat I be wit u forever n ever 
And I know dat ur mumma don�t trust me 
And she hates when u tell her that u love me 
But u no dat its gonna be alryt 
Coz it all from my heart and it takes time 
But girl ur the star in my sky 
Girl u stole my heart n I cant even lie 
But c I not tellin lies u fyn, ur worth dyin, cant get u outta my mind 
Girl its time to make love 

[Chorus x2] 

Its about that time baby 
look up in da sky and u will c me in da light the size (?) 
But we be way more serious than boyfriend and girlfriend 
U got my head spinnin like a whirlwind 
Shorty, I no I made some mistakes but I can 
Make it up by givin u this way and take it I know 
It int no need to push and shuv 
Hold and grab 
The man above let us kiss n hug 
Coz baby.. 

[Chorus x2]
