EVER

A thousand rounds, about a million shots
I'm going pound for pound, so I can feel the drop like
But I can't leave and feel my hands
But this liquor in my system
make me need to go and dance
I want to go and hit a thousand chicks
like I got a thousand dicks
But I really need just one, Imma take her
to my house and shit
Lounging shit, yeah, we gon drink until we fall
But I'm gon sip a little bit more
cause I just can't feel it at all

Is this love?
I know it ain't but we can say it is right now
How crazy is this? From the club
Now you bout to have the best sex ever
You wouldn't know I did it like that shawty
So never say never
Look out below!
We was just up in the club
now we bout to have the best sex ever
You done heard it all before, I guarantee
that I do it better
Look out below!
We was just up in the club
and we just had the best sex ever
Hold up, wait
Ok, you gotta go (Peace!)

Back in the club, pressed in my nigga's covers
Mouth still smelling like pussy
hands still smelling like rubbers
What's up shawty, come and sip on this moscato
Me and my niggas got Vip sections
you think that we just hit the lotto
Girl you need to understand
that the more that I keep drinking
I'm gon need to put my hands on that
Right now we don't give a damn
But that pussy getting gushy
like you peed up in your pants
