Hey, aha, it's like a scene on top of a scene
What I do you? aha
Over again and over again, you ain't gotta move, aha
And when you look into my eyes I gotta go harder, aha
And when you climb on top of me, I hit rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom

She got me thinking, about what I got
She hop in the lincoln, we hit my spot
I got her drinking, she getting hot
She want me on bottom, bottom, rock
She saw my... that big old rock
That bitch is blinging blinging, non stop
And now she getting dicky, she on the top
That means I'm on the bottom, bottom, bottom
She be going down and she come back up

Some of the loving that you never had
So let me get a rubber out this gucci bag
We gonna do something that make your daddy mad
Now baby put your hands up and say yeah

Hey, aha, it's like a scene on top of a scene
