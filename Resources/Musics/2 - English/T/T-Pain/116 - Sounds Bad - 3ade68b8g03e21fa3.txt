SOUNDS BAD

[intro]
hmmmm
I wanna dedicate this to my struggling bro
keep pushin on 
keep pushin on
yeah

[verse 1]
first of the month 
check lane
got nothing to do (got nothing to do) 
Imma roll me a blunt
got drain
call me a hoe or 2
now I know that it sounds like I'm livin on the edge (hmmm hmmm)
homie he ain't herd the worst
got the whole house runnin on the generator
no good food in me fridgidator
and I'm late for work 

[chorus]
don't that sound bad
more and more
no respiration
no goals 
I know it sound like
I want it mine
and I know I'm so miserable
but this just so happens to be 
the best day of my life

[verse 2] 
now I dont wanna confuse ya
I'm hurtin' on the inside
but I wont let u see (nah wont let u see)
that's why every little dollar
and every little penny
goes to putting a outfit on me 
cuz I'mma stay fresh to def just to impress the rest 
u know how I do it when I do it
Imma show u how to do it so u can do it for sumbody else


but I still got the house on the generator
no good food in my fridgidator
and I'm late for work 

[chorus]
don't that sound bad
more and more
no respiration
no goals 
I know it sound like
I want it mine
and I know I'm so miserable
but this just so happens to be 
the best day of my life (my life mmm)

[bridge]
myt look drunk
pik up ice
drink drink drink drink drink drink
I'm talkin bout that bullshit
I'm talkin like a newspaper
I'm talkin bout the newspaper full of weed
like the whole thang (hahaha)
and imm roll it up n smoke
hey 
hit this lemme hit this
Imma let you think about you
and in the end
u got to let me do what I do

[chorus](x4)
don't that sound bad
more and more
no respiration
no goals 
I know it sound like
I want it mine
and I know im so miserable
but this just so happens to be 
the best day of my life
