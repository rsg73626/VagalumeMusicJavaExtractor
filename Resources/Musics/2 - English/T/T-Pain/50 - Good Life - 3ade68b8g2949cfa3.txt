GOOD LIFE

(like we always do at this time
I go for mine
I got to shine)
Now throw your hands up in the sky
(now I, I go for mine
I got to shine)
Now throw your hands up in the sky

T-pain ima get on the tv mama mama
Ima put this ---- out
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where these ----- sell d
Only then get pulled over in their new v
The good life
Lets go on a lemi-spree
Say the best things in life are free
The good life
It feel like atlanta
It feel like l. a
It feel like miami
It feel like n. y
Summer time child ahh

Now throw your hands up in the sky

So I rolled threw good
Yall pop the trunk
Ill pop the hood, ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that
I got to look, sorry
Yo its got to be
Cause 'em season haters
Givin me salty looks, loweries
Fifty told me
Go head and switch them styles up
And if they hate then let them hate
And watch the money pile up

*** (now I, I go for mine
I got to shine)
Now throw your hands up in the sky
(now I, I go for mine
I got to shine)
Now throw your hands up in the sky, ayy

T-pain ima get on the tv mama mama
Ima put this ---- out

Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

Welcome to the good life
We'll be like the girls who aint on tv
Cause they got more --- than the models
The good life
So keep it comin' with them bottles
Till she feel booze like she bombed out apollo
The good life
It feel like houston

It feel like d. c
It feel like v. a
Or the bay or yeahh ayy
This is the good life

(welcome to the good life)
Homie tell me whats good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
(welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish ---- would
(welcome to the good life)
He prolly think he could
But... but... I dont think he should
(welcome to the good life)
Fifty told me
Go head and switch them styles up
And if they hate then let them hate
And watch the money pile up

***chorus

Have you ever popped champagne
On a plane
While gettin some
Whipped it out she said she never seen snakes
On a plane
Whether you broke or rich
You gotta get biz
Havin moneys not everything
Now havin it is

But when I get my car back
Activate it, I'm back to vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashin
Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagine
(its the good life, better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gunna go crazy
Now my grandmama aint the only girl callin me baby)
