FANTASY

Woaaah
 Woaaaaaaaaaaaah
 Woaaaaaah
 Woaah

 Come and lay down
 Relax
 Lemme show you what I do
 Make you feel good
 React
 Just as if I were you
 Cause I can make you see
 The heavans
 Using nothing but my hands
 If you wanna do me
 Lift my booty
 Maybe take off my pants yeah

 What does a real man do for his lady
 Anything that he can
 If you do it right
 At the end of the night
 You can be my number one fan (ooh) tasy
 You can be my number one fan (fan) tasy
 You gon be my number one fantasy
 You gon be my number one fan (fan) tasy
 Baby, you can be my number one fantasy

 Common
 Let's do what we always do
 Flip over
 Throw it back
 I'm a throw it all to you
 Baby I can feel your love comming down
 So I know I'm doing a good job
 I'm a lay down
 Relax
 Come over here and get on top
 I'm a show you what I can do for my baby
 Make her feel like she flying
 Flip over again and let's do it one more time
 Cause

 You gon be my number one fantasy (baby)
 You gon be my number one fantasy (oooh)
 You gon be my number one fantasy
 Baby, you gon be my number one fantasy
 You gon be my number one fan (fan) tasy
