Yeah,I where my pants below my waist (we always gonna be the best)
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Because you and your man is planning to hate (We run this man)
I'm so hood
And I got these gold up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you'll know what I'm talking about (I make hit records this is what I do)
(I'm of the) hood (This the remix)
And if you feel me put your hands up Hood (put em up, put em up, put em up)
My hood niggas can you stand up (I gave you we taking over)

And It you're not from here you can walk it out
If You don't know what I'm talking about
IÂ‘m so Hood (hey young jeezy)
(you got me we run this man we run this)

[Young Jeezy]
I'm so h to the double-o d
got all this god damn money on me
Pockets so fat it don't make no sense
Whips so clean don't need no tints
Watch so bright I don't need no light
And no where word don't need no mic
Niggas like yeah what you get for show?
Tell em same thing I used to get for the blow
Send on em on the road nigga what I got to lose
Put em in the vans i ain't talkin' about the shoes
Do the speed limit nigga watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dikes
Seventeen five yeah nigga I said it
Seventeen five yeah nigga yeah I meant it
And when we do it bad and when we do it good
I'm so I'm so i'm so mother fucking hood

[Ludacris]
Everybdy come equipped with bangas
Throwing up our middle fangas
And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep 10 in the clip and 1 the chambers
Better be walking with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Luda's dressed in stripes had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals
I'm in the zone homes going for the two point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris should've been on the original version
But this is the remix
With the cheap tricks
Hitting sweet licks
And I cut the braids off with the waves and the fade that will make you sea sick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way we roll
So put a fist in the air if you care
United we stand and divided we fall
When the south is in the house you better watch your mouth
Cause we on that hood shit I'm hood rich
Coming around your hood bitch
I swear i'm so..

[Chorus: T-Pain & Busta Rhymes]
I'm so hood (remix)
And if you feel me put your hands up
Hood
My hood niggas can you stand up
(I'm so hood)
And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (the king of the streets and the gods of the
hood)
You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Busta bust bitches)
I'm so hood

[Busta Rhymes]
See all i know is that i got to get my money
Again and again
top down
Let the money blow in the wind
with bad bitch sitting in the passenger seat
Where the doo be wrapped head full of bobby pins
You know I keep the thing when i walk
see the dialect
Different from the slang of my talk
Baby still living got a crack in front of another bad bitch that will
Boost for the spot
I'm used to leaving the strip last
Hustling until the sun comes up getting cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It looks like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and
Try to do what I does
And if the other nigga ain't really hood
You can easily die
tell who that fake nigga was (Hood)
And even though I spit a little rap
Got Niggas in the hood trying to sell the most crack
Violator, i send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit
back
Yall niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest until the day that I'm done
So hood where we live where my niggas sold drugs and they rich
and mama still proud of her son

[Big Boi]
Fatty Fat Fat
So hood like the Cadillac
On the mint full of my babalance
Call an ambulance
To come and pick his ass up because a nigga never had a chance
They try to dance with a devil in the pale moonlight
Advance on the level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fellow like the man in blue lights
Woop, woop
Do it twice
You're boy the B - I - G
I'm nicer than mc in your top three
You cocky?
I cock, Squeeze
Bust them things now you sloppy
Speed it up,slow it down,then screw it
Don't bite the flow because I got that blew it
Run through the crew or some whole other new shit
Newness bitch we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain & Lil Wayne]
I'm so hood (remix)
And if you feel me put your hands up
Hood
My hood niggas can you stand up I'm so hood
And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (alright)
You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Weezy)
I'm so hood

[Lil Wayne]
I'm so Hollygrove, New Orleans, Lilweezyana
home sweet home depot
you will need a hammer
it go down like fraiser
I ain't talking Kelsey grammer
I be shitting on your boys I need an alka-seltzer sandwich
Since I heard Plies I done brought the phantom back
Went and got me a 52 inch Maybach
I'm eating like a big dog
I'm so full, I'm so good
I'm so straight, you so fake
I'm so real I'm so hood

[Fat Joe]
Yeah nigga
Welcome to the crack house
I should own a McDonalds
The way I bring the mac's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams
they tell you they baking pies shit
Still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her good lookin'
You's a crack baby that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me that's what the hood made me

[Baby]
Martin Luther King (MLK)
Callio, Magnolia, Melphimine
Gettin that Money with a triple beam
See rattle cry your Josephine
Saints is my team
that's what we breathe nigga
that's how we eat
get this money on the streets nigga
V L my street blood
5 star G blood
Fly as a bird
Got these eagles on my seat blood
Then hit back where I'm staying
Third ward we get that cake
Thirteen is where I lay
shots out to MIA

[Rick Ross]
More money more problems
Don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss
Always got watch you needed
MIA you're so hot
But my neck got the fever
If you sneeze you get shot
Gun play makin believers
I just bought me a ranch
Watch the hundred stacks
No those ain't Rolex diamonds
What you done to that?
You fools for gazing
My fools from Haiti
I move some daily
It's a movie baby
Hood
