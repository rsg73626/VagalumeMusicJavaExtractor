SHE SAID

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Come, don't stop
Come, don't stop
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

Girl it's yo turn to do what you wanna do
Don't even tell me what you gonna do
It's about to go down
Call up your friend and tell her to come in
You know I ain't runnin
I got enough to go around

And I won't say a word if you tell me not to
Please tell me not to
Tonight you're in control, baby do what you got to
I just wanna watch you
Sing it for me
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)

1 (Ah), 2 (ah), 3 (ah)
And that's what she said
Ah, ah, ah
That's what she said

How could I learn if you don't give me discipline?
Bring the chains and the whips in
Baby talk me down
Show me how bad I've been
Show me how mad you are
Uh I'm in trouble now

And you won't let me come even if I'm about to
Please tell me not to
Tonight you're in control, baby do what you got to
I just wanna watch you
Sing it for me
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)

1 (Ah), 2 (ah), 3 (ah)
And that's what she said
Ah, ah, ah
That's what she said
