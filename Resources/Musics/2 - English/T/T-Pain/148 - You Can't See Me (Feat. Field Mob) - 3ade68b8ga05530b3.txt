YOU CAN'T SEE ME (FEAT. FIELD MOB)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Teddy Pain is the name bitch don't get it confused
All you lames in the game have never spit on a dude
Tell ya dame to get a swimsuit and come get in my pool
See nodding once and now we working on (hmm, hmm)
I pull up on you with the quick fast, style on your bitch ass
You niggas ain't hold the weight the rap game 
been drankin Slimfast (oh no)
See I go ham sandwich on everythang I do
So when I put it down all you pussy niggas can say is "WOO! "
Da bod mon flow, niggas like whatta gawn
Fiya droppin' fiya ain't no need to turn da watta on
So gimme your bitch with the big enough ass 
to put some butta's on
And I'm a drop that shit that it'll make a nigga feel guts 
all when it cuts it off

[Hook:]
If I'm lyin I'm dyin I'm the bidness
Lonely in the jungle where the lion I'm a kill it
Die Hard nigga call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit homeboy I'm the realest, nigga

Girl, you can't see me no I'm too dangerous
You can't see me no I'm too dangerous
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ohh
No-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ohh

[Verse 2: Smoke]
K is nothing new to me so hate on hate on
My eighty-year old twin sisters same ole same ole
It's Claritin than unicorn having glitter but six
With a fairy skiing down that double rainbow
Range Rove no shoes the truck got the bare feet out
No more roaming noodles like a dike I go and eat out
I'm bald headed but still Nappy Boy it's the click
Like game in 6 we the shit on a stick, pause
My Chevrolet Camaro's high yellower than that nigga Drake
Rims blacker than Wesley Snipes I'm sitting on Blades
Like a borne on fire I'm burning heavy hay
And Smoke stands for smoke oze of kush everyday

[Hook]
If I'm lyin I'm dyin I'm the bidness
Lonely in the jungle where the lion I'm a kill it
Die Hard nigga call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit homeboy I'm the realest, nigga

Girl, you can't see me no I'm too dangerous
You can't see me no I'm too dangerous
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ohh
No-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ohh

[Verse 3: Shawn Jay]
229, Yeah man
They ask me what happen with Field Mob 
I say two different egos clashing
Like Andre 3K and Cee-lo's fashion
Got micro-smoke dose responds with so outrageous
Ya girl say Shawn Jay ya smoke my favorite
I got her up in MySpace smoking my grape kush
She follow me like I'm Twitter then I poke her like Facebook
Realest nigga ever known killin every song
I don't fuck with lil boys I ain't Bishop Eddie Long
I ain't trippin nigga goin 'head, hate us bitch
These facts I'm a mack but I don't make up shit
I keep a click of killers with me winked up like ya baby mama
I'm a don with a Caddy pussy nigga bring the drama
