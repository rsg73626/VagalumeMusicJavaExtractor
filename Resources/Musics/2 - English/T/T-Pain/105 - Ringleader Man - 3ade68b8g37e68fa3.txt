RINGLEADER MAN

(Verse 1)
Ohhhhh Ohhhh Ohhhh
Heyy
We gon have a ripping good time
Just hit rewind and you can see I'm far too crazy
My rhythms and rhymes keep niggas in line
Cause now is not the time to be lazy
I'm the ringleader man a cane in my hand
And an iced out top hat on my head
ain't you tired of that wackness
Sick of this wack shit
Woulnd't you like some of me instead

(Chorus)
The ringleader man
This is my circus I'm working
I can flip this whole game with one hand
The ringleader man
I know its a fact that you rather
Just have some of me instead
The ringleader man (ha)
The ringleader man (haha heyyyy)

(Verse 2)
This industry is my circus
I know that it just hurts just sit back
And take pain like i used to
And I'm trying to stop cursing but i don't give a f**k
I'm going to curse you with lyrical voodoo
I'm the ringleader man
You cant understand the shit that comes out of my
head
But you like all that wackness
Loving all that wack shit i rather just say f**k you
instead

(Chorus)
The ringleader man
This is my circus I'm working
I can flip this whole game with one hand
The ringleader man
I know its a fact that you rather
Just have some of me instead
The ringleader man (ha)
The ringleader man (haha)
