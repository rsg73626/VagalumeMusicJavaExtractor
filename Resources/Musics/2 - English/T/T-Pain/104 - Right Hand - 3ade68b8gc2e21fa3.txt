RIGHT HAND

verse 1:
okay
wooooooo
yeah, yeah
woooo
yeah, yeah
baby sit down i got somethin that i need to say
right now before the rumor spread and make the way
around town i thought i'd be your man and tell u first
but i know its got to hurt
baby please let me explain
it happened all of a sudden out of control
she had my heart and would not let it go
im not tryin to say that it was okay
but that i didn't do

chrous:
but i gotta tell the truth
the truth the whole truth
with my right hand up
cuz i don't wanna lose u
its time to man up
i just gotta be the one to tell u
baby believe me when i say
u don't wanna find out the harder way

verse 2:
baby
would of never seen her walking
down the block i probably would have not
pulled over and asked her if she need it
but i noticed she had make-up on her eye
and she started to cry
said baby please explain
she said a man put his hands on her
he was out of control
and she really needs someone to hold

and not let go
and then she looked into my eyes just like you do
and i imagined she was you

chrous:
now i gotta tell the truth
the truth the whole truth
with my right hand up
cuz i don't wanna lose u
its time to man up
i just gotta be the one to tell u
baby believe me when i say
u don't wanna find out the hard way

verse 3:
baby i wish that i was a magician
and i could make all of this disappear
and baby i wish that i could go back in time
and trust me baby
we wouldn't be here
but you've been so good to me
how could i do this to you
and i never meant to hurt you
how can i prove it to you
im just trying to see what been on my mind
cuz in her you

chrous:
i gotta tell the truth
the truth the whole truth
with my right hand up
cuz i don't wanna lose u
its time to man up
i just gotta be the one to tell u
baby believe me when i say
u don't wanna find out the hard way
