It feels like,
I
Cant survive
Like im not alive
But you can revive, me

And i wont even try
To act like

Cant say goodbye
Cuz u can revive, me

I want u to hold me,
Console me
And i will give u, the whole me
Cuz u got me,
And i got you
We got love

Yea

*sigh*
Let it breathe,
Let it breathe
oooooo
I want you to hold me
*sigh*
