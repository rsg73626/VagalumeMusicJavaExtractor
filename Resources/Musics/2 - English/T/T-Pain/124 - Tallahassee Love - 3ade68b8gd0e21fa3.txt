TALLAHASSEE LOVE

Epiphany, E-P-I-P-H-A-N-Y
Definition one: the manifestation of a supernatural being
Definition two: a sudden moment of insight or a revelation
Marinate on the there

Tallahassee Love (ya)

[T-Pain]
They thought I left man (hahahahaha)
Yeah, T-P-A-I-N let's go man (aye)
T-Pain man, I'm back in this thang
You already know what it is (hey)
Tallahassee got my back though
This how I went (aye)

[VERSE 1: (T-Pain)]
I used to hit the stage with my shades on
40 brought me to the West Coast
Now it's khaki suits with my shades on
I'm on the same shit Game on
But on Sundays I'm like Diddy - grown man with one chain on
When I come back, niggas see my group
They see my Momma's two cars and both od my Daddy's boats
They see the Sean Jean coats and they see my wife hoppin out
the Laborghini with the Coach bag

I'm gettin paid for nothin
Sittin back, drinkin lemonade, chillin in the shade I'm stuntin
Makin hits when i graze the button
Go ahead and put them two baby seats in my Escalade, it's nothin
I'm gettin money - learned from the pastand the future
Learned not to never stab a nigga that'll shot ya
Even though my pockets gettin fatter
I'm still gettin Tallahassee Love and that's all that matters
J-Lyriq get em

[HOOK: (J-Lyriq)]
I been there, and I've been back
But somethin here always brings me back
So when I'm here, I get that TALLAHASSEE LOVE
If you love me, then I love you
My people love it, when I come through
So when I do, I get that TALLAHASSEE LOVE

[T-Pain]
It shouldn't have to be like this man
I don't know how I did it either man
I know you haters hatin this right here boy
TALLAHASSEE LOVE
Second time around, let's go man!
