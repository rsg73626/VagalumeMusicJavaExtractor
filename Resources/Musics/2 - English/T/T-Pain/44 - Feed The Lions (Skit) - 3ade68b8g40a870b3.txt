FEED THE LIONS (SKIT)

Now no-no-now nigga just, just sit down for a minute man
Cause I gotta get somethin off my chest
You understand me?
I'm on the high wire at every night
You understand me?
Balancing on that bitch is a motherf**ker
You understand me?
So you know, I'm balancin on that motherf**ker

And he gon give me you know
Twos and fews, twos and fews
Eerryy time twos and fews
But them motherf**kin midgets
Is gettin paid man, I'm tellin you

You understand me?
But this little ring leader cat

You know, I'm sayin every time

You know what I'm sayin?

Motherf**kin size gettin paid more than me?
You understand me?

And I'm taller than the motherf**ker

Shit is crazy mayne

White people sittin on the front row

You understand me?
One of em wanna throw some popcorn at the lion
I knew the motherf**kers hungry
Cause they didn't feed the motherf**ker at the last show

And the motherf**ker didn't even feed the lion
