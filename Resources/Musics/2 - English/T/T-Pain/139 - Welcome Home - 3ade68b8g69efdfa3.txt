WELCOME HOME

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
 Yo
 And that was Prevolver ladies and gentleman
 Hm-mm
 Okay
 Aye
 Thank you for listening; now I must get it in
 I can't leave rap alone I'm not finished bitch
 These cudos try to take away my spinach shit
 But my New York niggaz steady tell me get it kid
 You know I'm with it kid
 Put in my blood and sweat for you
 Now I'm holly and debt for you
 Got mad respect for you
 And if you can't respect that
 I'm Charlie Murphy on these niggaz 'take this check back'
 Robbin' niggaz faces like I'm 303
 Beautiful girls around the world like I'm B.O.B
 Dope lyrics come out my mouth come hear a kilo speak
 I guarantee I lay it down like I'm Ceelo Green
 But I'm a star now
 32 cars now
 Bugott's and Lamborghini's pull that double R out
 The legacy will start now
 I wish you could see me
 I'm in this muthafuckin' booth pouring my heart out (Hey)
 Yeah

 Hey
 If this ain't where I'm supposed to be
 Somebody show me how to get there
 Uh, I be rappin' I be trappin' I'm what's happa-neen'
 We ain't dinger rapping R&B singer T
 Yeeahh!

[Verse 2: Krizz Kalino]
 I travelled the world
 All on top of your girl
 I'm winning anyway
 Kali baby
 Na, na I shoulda been here a long time ago
 Somebody told me I wouldn't make it with ventilator on my face
 I'm survival with the grace of God and Tech N9ne
 The way I doodle on the paper Google me and check mine
 I'm not finished with this by damn far
 I had to pause a minute tell a bitch get in the damn car
 Keep my mind on my money says my grandpa
 Been gunnin for the stars and try'na be right where the fans are
 It's gonna take a miracle, this journey's been too difficult
 Get my money gotta live it up a life is pitiful
 But eat and sleep and shit ain't right before Biggie and Tupac
 I piggy bag off niggaz so my piggy bank is real fat
 Now I'm finished but I won't be leaving
 Big Chris I'm the shit if you must something's sneaking
 That's me

 Hey
 If this ain't where I'm supposed to be
 Somebody show me how to get there
 Uh, I be rappin' I be trappin' I'm what's happa-neen'
 We ain't dinger rapping R&B singer T
 Yeeahh!


[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
 Uhh, what the fuck they talking bout?
 You know I'm out rapping any rap artist out
 Cash Money Records big stones in my necklace
 Don't feel sorry for my father left me and my mom's neglected
 Smoking on that hydro, represent Ohio
 Girls lining up too slot me up wherever I go
 Chucks and some sweatpants, gotta keep it OG
 Don't change for nobody shit that's what Snoop told me
 Every movie I do it equals more sluts
 Niggaz mad cause my paper longer than my tour bus
 And too my competition, I'm coming for that title
 I'm the nicest nigga doin it I put that on the bible
 I just got to crush em, shit on em then flush em
 Rub what I acknowledge em muhfucka who ain't nothing
 Any city I step into my presence felt
 You think you hotter than me, kill yourself!
