THE WORD

[Verse 1:]
 Look at him spittin rhymes, look at him hittin dimes
 Travellin' all around the word (word) word (word) uh (uh)
 Look at him hit the stage, look at him rip the place
 For grown women and little girls (girls) girls (girls) uh (uh)
 But at the same time he's doing the same thang
 
Remember 05, well this the same Pain
 But everytime the rap game go down the drain
 The Louis Vutton jewelry box allowing him to change range
 I'm here to change things but they don't like diversity
 Until they ask to let somebody write a verse for me

 But I say hell naw
 Fuck them niggas and they bins tell em 
I don't see em like Patti Labelle draws
 I wanna make a living and niggas want me buried
 So I told Dex to put me in the pet cemetery
 So I can come back out of the dirt and truly thank him
 And tell em how Jesus introduced me to Ben Franklin

 (Preacher preaches)
 You bascially impowered
 Most of us that have it
 The holy goal with no man has ever gone before
 Yeah, yeeah he has giving us a stiff
 And the average human being does not care

[Verse 2:]
 How hard is it to make it? And ya fuckin respect it
 It seems like you just get in this shit to get rejected (your outta here!)
 And in some cases I done caught my damn self
 Hating on another nigga just because he getting sweaty
 Uh, this shit is hard as it'll ever get
 It's like waiting to fuck a girl that you'll never hit
 
And everytime you walk out the bitter with blue balls
 Then go and waste your money on making your Chevy too tall
 Damn, the life I live is full of public secrets
 And I'm the blame even if they didn't fuckin see it
 A modern day Frederick Douglas how can you beleive it
 Like Sadatay, Pootie Tang use the belt to beat it
 
Man, if you wanna lose then nigga go 'head
 But ain't nobody ever goin say Pain got a swoll head
 Unless I'm in the dressing room getting me some slow head
 Fucking with a seven or like seven of a co-ed's
 Uh

 (Preacher preaches)
 ... did his own crew
 Everybody wants to get his old crew rich
And then they want the other lil people never get a piece of the pie
And that can only go for the cracker, that go 
for you niggas that think that y'all big too

 I understand this, that's right you niggas and crackers can't stand me
 You niggas must know that I know you can't do nothing if you broke
 Listen to me young people, old people too, mostly black people I'm talking to you
 You can't do nothing if you broke!
