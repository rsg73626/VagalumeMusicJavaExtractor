STUDIO LUV

Yeah 
In the studio, in the studio 
Studio oh, oh 

Girl just close your eyes 
And picture me playing your Spanish guitar 
Baby where we going, there are no such thing as a ban do (ban do) 
If I could I would, stroke your body like I do my keyboard 

Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before 

[Chorus] 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
Let's make luv in the... 

I see you from the boo 
And you remind me of a brand new saxophone (saxophone) 
Girl I'm trying my best, but the music won't let me leave you alone 
And your body is like a flood, I can't stop floating on you 

Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before 

[Chorus] 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
Let's make luv in the... 

Do you mind if I pluck upon you string for one minute? 
And do you mind if I do some nasty things for one minute? 
Girl! 
If I could I would, I would stroke your body like I do my keyboard 

Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before 

[Chorus] 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
Let's make luv in the (studio) 
Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
(Studio), (studio), (studio)
