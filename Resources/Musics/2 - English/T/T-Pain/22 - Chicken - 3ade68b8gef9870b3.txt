CHICKEN

Somebody gonna die tonight
Hey, somebody gonna die tonight
And it might be you, girl
I'm in the green chevrolet
You in the orange one
And all I can think about
Is that thing that you done
No it ain't no race
We not cruisin'

This is a regular case
Of mobile fusion
I wanna see yo face
When you get the contusions
Cuz everything you say
Is starting to get confusin'
So everybody make way
Turn on my racin' music
You ain't got much space
You better learn how to use it

Lets play chicken bitch
Two cars, two starting lines
Get in yours and I'ma get in mine
And we gonna find out who gonna end up dyin'
Lets play chicken bitch
This here what we gonna do
We gonna put the pedal to the metal
If I die, you can get another fella
Who can better cater to yo needs than me, me, me, me
