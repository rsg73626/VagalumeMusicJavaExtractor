Goin' on a trip i be back home boy i'll see you later
goin back to a time where i know every thing was straighter
and everything's great now
but back then it was greater
and i don't need no clothes
i'll go in just what i'm wearin
matter fact i'll just go back with what i used wear then
no matter how bad the weather
everything back then was just so better
i can dream
it's a simple thing
i'm building a time machine

back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time
i can dream
it's a simple thing
building a time machine
back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time
i can dream
it's a simple thing
i'm building a time machine

yea
goin back to a time where this music shit was more than business
back to a time when i knew my niggas was down and if they still is
and i didn't have to worry bout what i got on when i go outsizzide
and i didn't have to worry bout what kinda car i got when i rizzide
and i didn't have to have twenty-twos, twenty-fours to twenty-sixes
and i didn't have to be forever surrounded by a million bitches
no matter how bad my life was
i still got love no matter how mad my wife was
i can dream
it's a simple thing
i'm building a time machine

back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time
i can dream
it's a simple thing
i'm building a time machine
back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time
i can dream
it's a simple thing
building a time machine

back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time
simple thing
back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time
simple thing
building a time machine
