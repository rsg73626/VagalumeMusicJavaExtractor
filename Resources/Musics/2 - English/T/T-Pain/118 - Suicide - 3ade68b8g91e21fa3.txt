SUICIDE

I've sat here thinkin bout you all night Girl
Damn, i can't conrol myself no more girl and it's killin me
I can't take this pain no more can you feel me?
i wish you could see the control you have over me
All them boys in the streets wonderin what im doin where im at
i aint seen you in a while and after all this time you still
aint called.. I've had the bullet in the gun and when I
decide to pull the trigger this vision comes in my mind

I see your smile glarin up at me sayin baby i love you.
Your eyes sparklin in the light
What are you doin to me? What was your plan.
You know i love you girl but i can't take this pain
NO MORE

I'm busy drivin round town too early in the mornin
Your on my mind and i wonder after all this time
Do you remember this road we road down together
when i first said i love you and meant it
You looked up at me as i pulled to a stop at this bridge
then spoke the words that keeps ringin in my head and
now im back at this same spot..replayin that very same night
Just about when i get ready to run it off the bridge

I see your smile glarin up at me sayin baby i love you
Your eyes sparklin in the light
What are you doin to me? What was your plan?
You know i love you girl but i can't take this pain
NO MORE


I walkin the lonely streets and i come up to your door steps
Lookin through you window hoping to find you asleep
but what i didnt want to see was you in the arms of another
Knowing he's what you want i cant help to remember
When it was me
I cant take it no more now im headed to the lake
the thoughts in my mind of what im doin
WOuld it even bother you if i died for you or because of you
as im ready to jump all i picture is

Your smile glarin up at me sayin baby i love you
Your eyes sparklin in the light
What are you doin to me? What was your plan?
You know i love you girl but i cant take this pain
NO MORE

I see your smile glarin up at me sayin baby i love you
Your eyes sparklin in the light
What are you doin to me? What was your plan?
You know i love you girl but i can't take this pain
NO MORE
