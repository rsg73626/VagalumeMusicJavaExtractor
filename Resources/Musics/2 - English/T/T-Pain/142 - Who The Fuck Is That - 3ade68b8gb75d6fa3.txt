WHO THE FUCK IS THAT

I own the club
That's right
Akon, Dolla-Dolla
Especailly the strip club
Let me talk to em T-Pain
Let me talk em
Konvict let me
Talk to em

Chorus:
I hit the club with a mug
So mean got them niggas
Like who the fuck is that
Then I hop up out the car
So clean got them hoes
Like who the fuck is that
Hit da door like right
Left back fourth
Yeah, I got money nigga
That's of cousrse
Hit the stage
With a b-boi stance
The club owner like
Who the fuck is that

Pull up in something
Tented 200 on the dash
Ya'll shit rented
I drop cash
Watch the doors lift up
This nigga then went mad
I'm wat you never had
Some of this some of that
Tell that bitch
To give me kiss
Then I smack her on ass
Throw a stack
At her and laugh
This shit to me
Ain't nothing
How much money do you have?
That's not up for discussion
I be mashin out
Wih something european
On them buttons
I been rich since I was 11
My grams look
Like 7's my killers
Look like reverends
Yea u better count
Yo blessings
Convict piece around my neck
Misdameter on my risk
Got a fellon on my pinky
Got you blinking when it glince
I got strippers on a payroll
Charges in Diego
Ya-yo like it's Mayo
Don't play around with me Paso
You should see the stello
Neighborhood nino
Bithces call me Dolla
But these niggas call me D-Bo

I hit the club with a mug
So mean got them niggas
Like who the fuck is that
Then I hop up out the car
So clean got them hoes
Like who the fuck is that
Hit da door like right
Left back fourth
Yeah, I got money nigga
That's of cousrse
Hit the stage
With a b-boi stance
The club owner like
Who the fuck is that


Akon:
Niggas that u ever saw
Don't make me have to come
Around and spray at all y'all
The world so small
It's big as a golf ball
Just like them perfect titties
It's pressing against the wall
And while we tossing dollars
They be staring at my team
You wishing that a nigga
Had looking so clean
Track jacket on my back
Looking mint green
Hanging off my ass
It's some konvict jeans
Your no longer better
Your in alot of chedder
No matter how
Ya look at it bet
I can do it better
No need for lookin better
Like a glass of armmeretter
Got a lil Vendetta
Then bring out
The heavy metel
Pull up on that trigger
Like I'm pulling on
These hoes
After magic city
Nigga anything goes
So impateint
Can't wait to club close
I'll be in the lambo
Poppin side ya don

I hit the club with a mug
So mean got them niggas
Like who the fuck is that
Then I hop up out the car
So clean got them hoes
Like who the fuck is that
Hit da door like right
Left back fourth
Yeah, I got money nigga
That's of cousrse
Hit the stage
With a b-boi stance
The club owner like

Dolla:
I'm shinning
Like a motherfucker
Vvs it blanking
Steve earkle by the tongue
That purple steady stankin
You talking yo the deckin
I got swag I got juice
See me in that bentley coupe
Right from runnin shoot
You be running when I shoot
I be shooting where you running
'Kon got me out the streets
Told me dolla get the money
Now I'm the club
Stuntning like la, la, la, la
Laughing at these cow niggas
Like ha, ha, ha, ha
Look you fucking with a winner
Stripping lobster for dinner
Bet you any game
You other just beginners
In my d-oy stancebout
To pop a rubber band
Fuck that fighting in the club
You nigga fuckin' up my plans
I'm tryna get a dance her name
And her number taker her
To the telly get some brain
In the hummer
You niggas make it rain my dollar
Make it thunder album coming soon
Bitch get ready for the summer
