SAY IT

Pull up to my crib in ya black Range Rova 
I got some plans that don't involve my hands 
Get out and walk up slowly 
Lemme see your new Menolo's 
I don't think your ready for what's about to happen behind closed doors 
And girl 
I want you to enjoy yourself 
Have you feelin so good inside 
So jump up on this rollercoaster 
Let me take you for a lappy ride 

And imma make ya say it (whoa whoa) 
Say it (whoa whoa) 
Say it (whoa whoa, what are you waiting for) 
Say it (whoa whoa) 
Say it (whoa whoa) 
Say it (whoa whoa, what do you got in store) 
Say it (whoa whoa) 
Say it (whoa whoa) 
Say it (whoa whoa, cut off the lights and close the door) 
Say it (whoa whoa, ...??iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii) 

Girl ya skin tone's so lovely 
Got me breakin out in cold sweats 
You been here for 15 minuets i don't know which way to go yet 
Girl ya so soft 
I wanna break ya off with some of this good (la ooo) 
You can tell me what to do 
I wont stop untill you say so 
And girl i want you to enjoy yourself 
Feelin so good inside 
So jump up on this rollercoaster 
Let me take you for a lappy ride 

And imma make ya say it (whoa whoa)
