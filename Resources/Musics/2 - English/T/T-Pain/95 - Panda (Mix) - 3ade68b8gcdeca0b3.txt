Rice and peas, macaroni cheese
Collared greens

She just make a whole bunch of good shit

I got the rice sitting on the tow truck
Had to hit me with some bands
He can get me that brown paper bag

With my zoes bro down in florida
I stack it, stack it, pack it, pack it
Stack it, pack it, stack it
Pack it, in that order
Hold up, I'm all the way up
I need to put something in my soda
I don't need no lunch
Imma go get a bunch of asian bitches
Up in the rover

They thought that t-pain
Wasn't gon' to come back
Now go tell them that when you run back
You a hoe, so you already done that
Hold up, I'm all the way up
I need to put something in my sprite, bitch
If you think you're doing it, I
'm about to ruin it
You're niggas
Are going to learn tonight, bitch
If you think I'm lit now, watch what happens
When I come and turn on the light switch
I will not plan this shit
I come and handle it
Boy that ain't shit but a flight, bitch

I mean really though
If you think about it
Really think about it how hard
Do they really go?

Now you really know

Panda, panda, panda, panda

I got bitches in the bronx, nigga
They can get me in the back door
Rob a nigga in the trap house
Bitch you just walked in the trap door
Caught the body in the bugati
Go put the bricks in the wrapper
Thought they was sleepin on pizzle
Somebody go ask these niggas
What they takin' a nap for
Illuminappy, that the squad, nigga
Without that shit I would've been dead
But I swear to god I'mma keep killin' niggas
And I put that shit on my kid's head
Cash know. I'm an asshole
So don't fuck with pizzle and his bread
I'm the type the type of nigga
That'll find a nigga
Then go and find his chick
And a get bitch head
Yea, I'm all the way up
¿dónde estás, mi amigo?
Don't put your eye in that peephole
Cause I'll turn the back
Of your head to a peephole
Think again, and then go
And murk all your people
You already know the weapon is lethal
Flip the clip, guy get back
Pull the hair trigger
Yeah nigga, back for the sequel, oh
I got problems in my head, nigga
Smokin' that shit from the west coast
The major key is when you hatin' me
You could fuck around get your neck broke
You fuck around with the winsquad
They could find your body at the texaco
The summer comin' and you comin' with nothin'
You ready pussy-nigga, let's go

All I say is panda, panda
And they handle-handle my shit
While I'm chillin' up in alabama
Tryna show a bitch how fast a lambo can get
With all of this green up
Under these gold chains
They mistakin' me for the king
Bitch, I make platinum
I'm comin' after them
Passin' them, all I do is fucking win, bitch

I got broads out in cali
I got hoes gettin' ratchet
Hit dispensaries and grab it
Wrap it all up in that plastic
Usps, I'm a track it
Two day priority, I have it

Two hundred racks in the mattress
I don't know about y'all
But I'm a street nigga
Ain't gotta sound like nobody

Been on tour with t-pain
That's for free, nigga
That's why I still fuck with them bricks
And the weed, nigga
And that's why I hop in my jag
My nigga go hop in that benz
My nigga go hop in that porsche
And no we don't need no new friends
Cause we'll go hop in that ghost
And yeah that we'll still got the benz
Look at that lift on the fours
Look at the mothafuckin' rims
And I keep tryna tell you

In the world that'll drive you crazy
From the cocaine era, I'm a eighties-baby
