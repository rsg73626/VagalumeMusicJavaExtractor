HOW TO HATE

[ T-Pain]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cuz she knows that i'm a friend
But i can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to when you broke up with your boyfriend
Man, fuck him
Girl i was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn
And don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[hook: t-pain]
How to hate a bitch
That owe you everything
At least a wedding ring
Moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you
I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl i won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Lil Wayne]
And i don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with wayne cuz when it "waynes" it pours
No really, i'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when i went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, i guess i'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if i sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

[Lil Wayne]
Coconut ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch i already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and i wish i never met ya
And i heard you're doing you, and you heard i'm doing better
And all i had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, i was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy f, for fuck you

[Bridge: T-Pain]
No ain't nothing going on
Girl i'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here, girl i'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song i'm writing for you
Now i see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me
All you do is down me girl
How many years i tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cuz girl ?
