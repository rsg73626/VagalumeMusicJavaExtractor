MIAMI DOLPHINS

[Verse]
Miami has the dolphins,
The greatest football team!
We take the ball from goal to goal,
Like no one’s ever seen
We’re in the air,
We’re on the ground,
We’re always in control.
So when you say Miami,
You’re talking super bowl!

[Chorus]
Cause we’re the Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins number 1
Yes we’re the Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins number 1

Miami has the dolphins,
The greatest football team!
We take the ball from goal to goal,
Like no one’s ever seen
We’re in the air,
We’re on the ground,
We’re always in control.
So when you say Miami,
You’re talking super bowl!

[Chorus]
Cause we’re the Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins number 1
Yes we’re the Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins,
Miami dolphins number 1
