MY PLACE

Yeah 
How many times have I told you love you? 
Don't seem to change a thing 
Girl you're not the same 
There was a time when you want me to hug you 
And treat you like the lady that you wanna be 
But girl I knew that one in me 
Would never try to hold me back 
And do me all this wrong, girl what's going on? 

I tried to talk and you walk away 
Right of my face, right out of my place 
But... 

[Chorus] 
That's just it girl 
You just don't know how much I love you now 
That you walked out of my house 
That's just it girl 
Would it be another day, be another way 
To get you right back in my place 

That's just it girl 
You just don't know how much I love you now 
That you walked out of my house 
That's just it girl 
Would it be another day, be another way 
To get you right back in my place 

How many times have sat at the table? 
And both ate one time and said what's on our mind 
I'm thinking of a relationship was a fable 
A fairytale of me, that's just how it seems (oh girl, I heard) 
Even when I heard that you were cheating, I was faithful 
And would do any goddamn that you would say too 

I tried to talk and you walk away 
Right out of my face, right out of my place 
But... 

[Chorus] 
That's just it girl 
You just don't know how much I love you now 
That you walked out of my house 
That's just it girl 
Would it be another day, be another way 
To get you right back in my place 

That's just it girl 
You just don't know how much I love you now 
You walked out of my house 
That's just it girl 
Would it be another day, be another way 
To get you right back in my place 

That's just it girl 
Oh you just don't know how much I love you now 
That you walked out of my house 
That's just it girl 
Would it be another day, be another way 
To get you right back in my place 

That's just it girl 
Oh you just don't know how much I love you now 
You walked out of my house 
That's just it girl 
Would it be another day, be another way 
To get you right back in my place
