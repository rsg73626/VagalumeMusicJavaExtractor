HIT EM WIT IT

Boom!
 Phizzle
 Yah
 Young Track
 Uhh, ooh
 Yasimelike, leggo
 Leggo
 Leggo
 Leggo
 Boom, ha ha

[T-Pain:]
 Rockstar mentality
 I'm too real can you deal with reality?
 Hoes running after me
 Cause you ain't have to admit I am so your bitch fuck half of me
 Yeah, we go nuts like SU's
 And niggas hating cause the speakers bigger than Shaq's shoes
 We act fools, you know we pack tools
 We don't fit the description it's just a bunch of black dudes
 So back down, okay, okay
 I don't fuck around, no way
 Bring the trouble to your town and I know you hear the sound
 I be grindin' nigga I ain't went to sleep in four days
 Going ham is what I specialize in
 Bugatti is all that I ride in
 Ain't no need for that violence
 But if it is I leave a nigga neck crooked like a violin

 Boom!
 Leggo
 Leggo
 Somebody goin get it
 Summited young track
 (Hit em with it)

[Severe:]
 I take my shirt off and all the hoes just scream
 I thank I'm Juiceman rocking all 6 Rings
 Pull up on your board with the trunk just beating
 Like what is 2-10's compared to 4-15's
 Jewelry all black, charm is canary
 My ring finger blinking like I'm getting married
 Neck full of chumps, arm full of karats
 Got my shit on every Tom Dick and Harry
 When I hit the club you know that they goin grill
 So I mash out on sumthing I know that they goin feel
 I'm swagged out it's nothing I know that I'm goin drill
 Cause my bankrollers like park over ya own wheels
 Wanna be down like a flat tire blow
 Gotta have mouth like a dragon, fire blow
 And it's a rap for you lames, gyro
 I'm going out with a bang, pyro

 Who is that? [x3]
 C'mon
