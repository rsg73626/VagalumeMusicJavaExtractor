Cause soon as I wanna tell her, bet the music gone stop...

I'm try'na say lil momma 
This is all I want'cha to do: Put your drink down, 
Pick it back up 
Drink it 
Put it back down 
Pick it up again 
Drink it some more 
Put it down on the bar 
Slide it cross the bar 
Tell somebody to pass you your drink back 
Pick it up again 
Put it in my mouth 
I'm a take a sip of it 
Put it back down 
I want you to pick it back up 
Then you take a sip of it 
And both of us drunk as fuck 
And the first person that just slid for the first time 
Let's go 

Just slide with me baby, knahsayin? 
Fly on the clouds, knahsayin like

Together...
