OPEN

Uh (uh)
 Uh (uh)
 I got her open like a soda can
 And can't nobody get her back clothes
 Making plans sneaking in and out of backdoors
 Holding hands and everybody in the back knows
 
Something's going on but they keep they trap close
 Keep it simple in ways we never thought of
 And all the feelings from the beginning finally done caught up
 
And in our conversations the feelings never get brought up
 We sit and talk about getting riches, tearing the mall up
 But in the end it's sweet nothing's that I'm whispering
 Cause she get quiet every time before we get it in
 Pull out the CoverSutra

 We on the California king-size bed possibilities are limitless
 So Benasis you can really say I love her
 Or maybe more in love with that thang that's under the cover
 And mistletoe on Christmas is the only thing above her
 And I can guarantee that when she gone I'm thinking of her like

 Aye
 Where did you go? (yeah)
 How did you know? (yeah)
 I was in love, you was like (yeah)
 And I was like (yeah)
 And we was like (yeah)
 So within what we suppose to (yeah)
 And now I'm glad that I know you (yeah)
 Shawty you make me wanna sing
 Do-do-do-do-doo-do-do-do-doodo
