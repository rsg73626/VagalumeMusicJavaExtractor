RAPPA TERNT SANGA (INTRO)

[Talking]
ay thats how it go man [x3]
Shit im just a rappa ternt sanga man (what you is dog) 
Im just a rappa ternt sanga man (what you is dog)
Im just a rappa ternt sanga man
Ay what you is dog
Dont even worry bout it

[Verse]
Ay, naw let me tell you a little story
about this young rappa man
Shit, from the start in his heart
He had a pass in the same
Put a pass in it mane
Rappa, producer 
A whole stack of thangs
And then one day he said to himself
You know a man has to change
So now he a rappa, a sanga, a danca, a romancer
Man cancer cant be way more to serious
Im tryna drop this real but they aint hearin this
They fearin this
Used to all that shit they hear on the radio
I bet you I can stay here or somebody
And they gone play me though
So we came up, not givin a fuck 
What a nigga gotta say bout Pain
Got niggas lil ladies 
Droppin they panties
Smackin they fannies, sayin his name
So Im playin the game they want me to play
Sayin everythang they want me to say
And I promised home boy 
If I get back to this rappin
It wont be today
Aint got time for the rap shit, bap shit
Make a hand clap shit, 
Nappy, nappy, nappy mo nap shit
That shit second
This shit first
That shit harder
This shit worse
And this shit curse me
And it hurts me to let it go
But I gotta come back to the sack
To let these otha niggas know
That its another side of Teddy
Another dub side on the machetti
A fucking prime spot on the Chevy
The situation gets heavy
So find it in yo heart
To let me put this gang bangin shit away
I've made it up in my mind that Imma change today
A RAPPA TERNT SANGA
