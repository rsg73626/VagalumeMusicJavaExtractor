HANGOVER (FEAT. SKYE)

Woke up this morning with a headache
And the coldest ... I've ever felt in my life
My mind is empty, but my bed ain't
Oh, what did I do last night?

So I say "Doctor, doctor, take a look
There's something in my heart that's wrong
I've got feelings for this girl that I just met
I mean I haven't known her too long"

He said "Brother, brother, calm down
'Cause there ain't nothing wrong with you"
He said I'm just going through sweet love hangover
And it's sure ain't no cure for sweet love hangover

Got out of the bed with my mind blank
Asking who is he and where the hell am I
My body is empty but my heart ain't
Oh, what did I dream last night

So I say "Doctor, doctor, take a look
There's something in my heart that's wrong
See, I've got feelings for this guy that I just met
I mean I haven't known him too long"

He said "Sister, sister, calm down, honey
'Cause there ain't nothing wrong with you"
He said I'm just going through sweet love hangover
And it's sure ain't no cure for sweet love hangover
