YOU COPYING ME

Here's a little story that I got to tell
About a young mother fucker that went through hell
He started up in tallahassee florida
Hoping that somebody would save him from the border

He started making beats for the local stacking bread
And joined up with a click called the nappy headz
The money came slow but the hate came quick
Talking behind his back like pain ain't shit

He was going out of town just to put it on stage
Blind to the fact that he wouldn't get layed
Slept in car, clothes in the backseat
20 dollars to get them hoes in the back seat
Got tired of that then he set some goals
Hoping that his rap shit would get him to the get-to-go
Never thinking what he bout to be
Then 6 years later everybody copying me

You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?

One fateful day he said fuck it
Hoped in the chevrolet bucket
Then he went to micky d's got a application
No worry to just to where this rap
Will take him so he gave up took the paper home
4 dollars in an hour that's pay for hoe
But he ain't to grown
So he got no bills no car just enough to make it home

Then ring ring on a mobile phone area code say 404
Oh yo this akon what up nigga man,
The shit sounds good
Shut up nigga


Click!
Just leave me the fuck alone
And somebody better quit playing on my fucking phone
And then he said na this
What i am about to do have everybody copy you you see me na?

You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?

2 10's in the bucket man fuck
It I'm taking my black ass to the atl
And I'm a make it there in 3 in a half hours
Even if i gotta go through hell
Na i can't tell if this is the kind of choice i should be making all by myself
But i am gonna commit suicide
If i see another untalented nigga on the best buy shelf

Well hooked up with akon and bobocar sat down
At a pizza palor its kinda hard try to explain who you are
When you showed up getting off the marter
So i show the niggas a couple of dvd's cds some of the shit i did on tv
Cause i suked at basketball but this is way better after all
See me now nigga

You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
What? You copy me?
