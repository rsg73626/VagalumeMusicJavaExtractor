H-h-hair done, red lipstick
Type of girl that could make a pimp trick
Get the phone now, take a trip hit
Bad she with it on the low
Watch her get it on the floor
Round and round and round she go

Let's leave the club and let's blow this joint
Exit through the back, take it to the bad yeah
Cause our booty got swag

Swagging heavy in the game

Sneaking bottles out, the club
Tonight we're gonna, kick it on
Shake the spot, right now

Once we at the crib, it's a ride
Damn that ass is fat
