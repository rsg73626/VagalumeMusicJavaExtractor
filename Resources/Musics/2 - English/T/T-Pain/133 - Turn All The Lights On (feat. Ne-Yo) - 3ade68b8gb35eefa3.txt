TURN ALL THE LIGHTS ON (FEAT. NE-YO)

Turn all the lights on

Take off your shoes, shoes, shoes
Ain't nobody gonna see nothing
Bring out the booze, booze, booze
Baby girl, stop frontin'
Ain't nothin' to lose, lose, lose
And ain't gotta go to work no more
Fuck that place, fuck my boss
I'mma buy the bar
I don't care what is costs

So I'm going hard
I need some lights
It's way too dark
Oh yeah, I'm going in
And now I'm with my friends
Let the party begin

Turn all the lights on
Turn all the lights on

Put your hands up if you going hard
I need some lights
It's way too dark
Oh yeah, I'm going in
Okay, okay, I'm with my friends
Let the party begin
Turn all the lights on

Gimme that glass
Little bit of ice
Pour that red in there
This must be her song
Dancing like ain't nobody else in here
Sexy as she want to be
When she dancing extra close to me
I said, please excuse
She was stepping on expensive shoes
Just a little too hard
Shawty is a perfect ten
This angelic body made you sin
I love the way you get it in
Come over here and shake it for a gentleman
Girl, you going...

Going hard
I need some lights
It's way too dark
Oh yeah, I'm going in
And now I'm with my friends
Let the party begin

Turn all the lights on
Turn all the lights on

Put your hands up if you going hard
I need some lights
It's way too dark
Oh yeah, I'm going in
Okay, okay, I'm with my friends
Let the party begin
Turn all the lights on

I'm drinking something
I'm touching something
They need to turn off the lights
I'm drinking something
I'm touching something
They need to turn off the lights
I'm drinking something tonight
I'm touching something tonight
They need to turn off the lights
I'm drinking something tonight
I'm touching something tonight
They need to turn off the lights

Somebody
Turn all the lights on
Turn all the lights on

Put your hands up if you going hard
I need some lights
It's way too dark
Oh yeah, I'm going in
Okay, okay, I'm with my friends
Let the party begin
Turn all the lights on
