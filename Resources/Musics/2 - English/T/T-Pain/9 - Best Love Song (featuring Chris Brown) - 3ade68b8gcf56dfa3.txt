BEST LOVE SONG (FEATURING CHRIS BROWN)

[T-Pain]
Turn up the bass, turn up the treble
I'm about to take you to a whole other level!
DJ turn off what you're playing
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying!
Because this girl means so much to me
And now we're on the floor and she touchin' me
And if I wanna take her home
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio!

It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like that

[Chris Brown]
Turn up the lights, give me a mic
I'm bout to sing it to her just how she likes
Jump off the stage bombs away
Crowd surfin all the way (kowabunga)
You know it's right, just do the waves
Girl just move your body like a snake
And if you wanna get with me
Put your hands in the air, show me that energy

It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like that
Now we got love
We got love

Homie kiss your girl, shorty kiss your man
We can see you on the kissing cam
Please show me some love
Show me some love
Now look her in the eye, see baby I love you
I never put no one above you
And if you feel that way
Go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like

And if you feel that way
Go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh, baby
In love
