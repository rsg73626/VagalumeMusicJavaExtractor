Broke up with my girl last night

Put on a fresh white suit and a Minicoop
Sitting on dubs (sitting on dubs)

Everybody's jockin' me as soon as
I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)
200 bitches in the bed and man
Ain't none of them hot (ain't none of them hot)
'Cept for this pretty young thing that was workin'
All the way at the top (all the way at the top)

Ooh she made us drinks
To drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk
And then I think she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back
And then I think that
We hit it off something proper like

On a brand new ride (on a brand new ride)
Triple shot of patron on the rocks
With little bit a lime (with a little bit a lime)

Every time I hit the spot baby girl
Taking care of me (taking care of me)

Ever come out (ever come out)

Got a passenger side that's empty wanting it to

Just lookin' at you from a distance looking
Like a God damn star baby (baby)
