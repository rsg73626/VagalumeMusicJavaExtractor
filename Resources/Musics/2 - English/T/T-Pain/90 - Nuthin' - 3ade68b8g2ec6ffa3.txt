NUTHIN'

You n*ggas ain't nothing, nothing, nothing 
See me undercover fist poppin' with your cousin 
Pull up to the club, let you hear the speakers bump 
With a honey in the Hummer got her cumming on my thong 
I get second to none, drummer steady drumming 
And I don't need keys, I'm just stumping on the button 
Shawty want my lovin' she not thinking of the others 
So I told her get in line, she can come and take a number 
She looking at my pocket like she getting something from me 
And if she thinks she is then this b*tch is really dumb 
And I'm a boss, get lost, Maybach, Rick Ross 
I'm looking for a chick with the ability to get that booty jumping 
You see what I got kicking put my meat up in that oven 
And when it's all over, you can get ready for supper 
They say that I'm a porn star, call me T pumper 

Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
What you say 
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
What you say 
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
Hey I got you shakin' that thing like- 
Hell no, hell no, 
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it 
Got her sittin' here f*cking like it's nothin', nothin', nothin' 

Hey look at this motherf*ckin' rug that I'm cutting 
These b*tches act sedated but these chickens steady clucking, 
Like it's nothin', nothin', nothin' 
And they don't give a f*ck if I'm up in the Maserati, 
Or I'm ducking in the bucket and I love it 
Big Chain, teddy p, T-Pain, that's me 
I do my thang, 28's turning lane 
They see me with a couple bad b*tches and they know I keep it trucking 
Bottle of that drink and I'm feeling kinda lucky 
And if they're playing games it's the deuces that I'm talking 
Cause they know why they came they ain't f*cking, n*gga f*ck them 
In the hood, wassup? Damn right you gonna let a n*gga cut 
Fo' sho', me no, Teddy playin' from the A50 plus a nigger ain't 

Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
What you say 
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
What you say 
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
Hey I got you shakin' that thing like- 
Hell no, hell no, 
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it 
Got her sittin' here f*cking like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'
