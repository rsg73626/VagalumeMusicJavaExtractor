RIDGE ROAD

Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah

[VERSE 1]
Growing up wasn't easy for me, for my mama, for my daddy, life just wasn't happy at all.
Started out when I was 8yrs, and it blew up right behind, god just couldn't find me no way

[BRIDGE]
The way I feel, just can't compare
don't wanna be here, God take me there. Cause now I'm living on the road, going to do show after show, my mind's free and my eyes closed I go back to
Ridge Road.

[CHORUS]
R-I-D to the G to the E-R-O-A-D
