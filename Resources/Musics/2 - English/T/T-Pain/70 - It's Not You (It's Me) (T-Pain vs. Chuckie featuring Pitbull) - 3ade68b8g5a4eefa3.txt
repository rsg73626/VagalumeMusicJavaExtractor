IT'S NOT YOU (IT'S ME) (T-PAIN VS. CHUCKIE FEATURING PITBULL)

It's not you 
Ohh ohh ohh ohh (T-Pain, Mr. World Wide)
Not you
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
It's not you
Oh oh oh
Not you

I know I be
All Up in these clubs (clubs)
Playing with these girls (girls)
Travelin' around the world
I know I be
Messing with your feelings (feelings)
Money to the ceiling
It falls down to the floor
I know I be 
Fist pump, fist pump
Fist pumpin' like a champ (Yeah)
The music got me amped
I'm catching leg cramps
I know I be
Messin' us up
And that's all that I do
So if we break up
I can tell you 

It's not you (not you)
It's not you
Not you, It's me
And I know I be trippin' (Trippin')
But I need you to listen
It's not you (not you)
It's not you
Not you, It's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club
It's not you

Baby It's not you, It's me
It's not you, It's me
Baby It's not you, It's me
It's the dog in me
Baby It's not you, It's me
It's not you, It's me
Baby It's not you, It's me

I know we be
Kissin' all in public (public)
And girl I love It (love It)
Can't get enough of It
But girl lately (lately)
You been talking down (down)
Keep me with a frown (frown)
I can't keep you around
I know I be 
Fist pump, fist pump
Fist pumpin' like a Pro (Yeah)
Girl you already know
You've seen me do this before
I know I be
Messin' us up
You can tell me what to do
So if we break up
I can tell you

It's not you (not you)
It's not you
Not you, It's me
And I know I be trippin' (Trippin')
But I need you to listen
It's not you (not you)
It's not you
Not you, It's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club
It's not you (not you)
It's not you
Not you, It's me
And I know I be trippin' (Trippin')
But I need you to listen
It's not you (not you)
It's not you
Not you, It's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club
It's not you 

Baby It's not you, It's me
It's not you, It's me
Baby It's not you, It's me
It's the dog in me
Baby It's not you, It's me
It's not you, It's me
Baby It's not you, It's me
Woo 

They slip, I grip
She dip, I dip
I hit
No text, no Twitter
That girl's so bad
That thing so thick
And Pain, you can bet, I get her
Even the girls wanna hit her
So you know I'm gonna take one with her (fo sho')
more for Voli
pour it like water (let's go)
Fo sho' fill the club like New Orleans
She this, she that
Her ass so fat
And her kitty cat's down for a doggin'
Mira mamita, verdad que tu esta
Linda, rica y bonita
Pero la verdad Ã©s que quiero a tu amiguita
It's not you, It's me
I'm sorry
Dale
