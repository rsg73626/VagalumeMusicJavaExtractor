BROKEN WASTELAND

Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up

Oh, sit here, and watch our cities
Grow more polluted every day
It's a problem we all must face
C'mon, it's time to break the waste

Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up

Oh stand up, and name the nameless
We've had enough of their kind
What once came up is now coming down
Crushed, smashed, leveled to the ground

[Chorus:]
Broken wasteland rules no more
Broken wasteland watch it fall
Broken wasteland rules no more
Broken wasteland shocked and torn

Gone forever to concrete beast
Gone forever purveyors of peace
Gone forever the forgotten few
Gone forever time to start anew

Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up
Rip it up, tear it down, rip it up

Oh hold on tight, and face the future
We've left all of the crap behind
If we don't stop starting the game
We'll have no one but ourselves to blame

[Repeat chorus]
