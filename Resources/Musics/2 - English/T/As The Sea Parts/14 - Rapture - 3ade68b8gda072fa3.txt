RAPTURE

Immense and whole the power 
of a dream that has come true
Her strength held back the hours
And spread shadow on the truth
Destiny's daughter, her fatal beauty speaks
Now I taste the experience of her lies and self deceit

[Chorus:]
(Rapture) Beginning of the end
(Rapture) Be ready to defend

In the flesh commanding passion, 
Glaring lust into my eyes
I'm blinded by her spirit, not yet knowing her disguise
And I know that deep inside, 
When my trust becomes a fact
I'll pull out, she'll pull away And stab me in the back

[Repeat chorus]

Commanding with action
Like a fever driven molten spike
I drill her till her skin can crawl
Then she sets me up for the fall

[Repeat chorus]
Immense and whole power
of a dream that has come true
Overwhelming, never ending
Brings the fever out in you
Away you'll wail, until you're pail
With a craze of passion flow
When it ends it all depends 
get in or you'll never know

[Repeat chorus]
