LEGIONNAIRE

A lonely fortress a desert sea 
The legion holds its emptiness against the country's mortality 
Forceful kept soldiers guard the concrete rails 
Serving their lives in the legion or spend their time in violent jails 
The watchtower stands the point to view the lands 
The watch guard shall die the first target in the sky 
Legionnaire's fight and death who knows their ammunition's running low 
Stand up the corpse to hold their guns they have no exit and no place to run 
Fight the fight wrong or right a death sentence on a desert night 
Might to might the tower's height the watch guard falls in their sights 
Naked steel hand to hand freelance legion meets its final stand 
Hear the roar down they go across the sands their blood will flow 
A lonely fortress a desert sea 
The legion held its emptiness and lost to mortality 
Forceful kept soldiers died along the rails 
They served their lives in the legion but their purpose had sadly failed 
Fight the fight wrong or right a death sentence on a desert night 
Fight the fight might to might a death sentence has their plight
