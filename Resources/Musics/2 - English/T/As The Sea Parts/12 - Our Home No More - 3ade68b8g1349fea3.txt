OUR HOME NO MORE

Each Passing Day
Goes By Faster
Than The Last
The Eternal Rays
Of The Sun
Fade From Our Sight
The Howling Winds
Deafen Our Cries

What Has Man Done To Our Mother
Raping Her Of Her Beauty
Now She Lies Lifeless
Our Home Is Dying
Nevermore, Barren Forever More
Mankind Is Often Killing Without A Cause
Human Ignorance Will End Us All

Sitting By A Setting Sun
Awaiting For The Moon To Rise
Watching As The Waves Collide
Into The Sands Of Time
