KILL THE KING

Danger, danger - Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger - and life about to spill
Oh no! Move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm, Fly like the wind
I'm a pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the King, tear him down
Kill the King, strike him down

Treason, treason - The spectre looms again
treason, reason - The realm is safe and then
Oh no! Move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm, Fly like the rainbow
I'm a pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the King, tear him down
Kill the King, go take his crown - down

Kill the King
He'll rule no more, strike him dead
The people roar
Kill the King, take his head
Down, down, down, down
Oh kill, oh kill, oh kill, oh - oh
