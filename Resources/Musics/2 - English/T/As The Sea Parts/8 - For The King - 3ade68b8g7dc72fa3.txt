FOR THE KING

Take heed to the words of this man beneath his feet is where you stand 
Everyone and everything belongs to this man who is king 
With arms of steel the guards they stand protect the ruler of this land 

[Chorus:] 
Riding high the king's banner flies hold the king's flag to the sky 
Greet with lances the charging foe the rebels colors we shall bestow 
For the king! 
Gather arms and make a stand a war is sown in his own land 
To win the battle we all must try tis not our choice to live or die 
Beneath the castle slaves they lie can't you hear their stifled cries 
The traitors heads will be taken the ruler's words are not mistaken 
Don't you know you'll have to pay for what you do or what you say 
betray the king to serve your right reconcile your dying plight 

[Chorus] 
The king's life branches from royal tree a royal surf insanity 
Take the king's life and we shall all be free and spread the wings of destiny
