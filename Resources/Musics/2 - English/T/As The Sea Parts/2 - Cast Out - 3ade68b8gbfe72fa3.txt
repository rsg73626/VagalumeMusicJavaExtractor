CAST OUT

How much more can I take they don't realize their mistake
For these chains and shackles barred on me
A condemned man but why they're all deaf to my cry
And choose to end my life discreetly

All of the facts aren't clear my terrible fate grows near
Decision of the highest court to the gallows or the chair
The laws choice so unfair my sanity's mend is torn apart

A man's life has faded away so this great price I'll pay
For I have been cast out

Self defense is my plight to judge my way as right
To rid my guilt and fight my way no time left I must escape
No chance to hesitate a fugitive with no laws to obey

Cast out...
