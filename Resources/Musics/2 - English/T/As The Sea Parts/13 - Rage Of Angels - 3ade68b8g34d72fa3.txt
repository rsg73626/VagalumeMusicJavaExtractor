RAGE OF ANGELS

Foretell us of the secret hosts of evil's game 
Their names may not be spoke aloud 
Lest they profane mortal lips and take the blame 
From unholy darkness their attacking the heavens 

[Chorus:] 
A rage of angels descending from the skies 
A rage of angels seen through your eyes 
And though you've wandered from life to save you one lone angel flies 
Defending all that's sacred hither hath we go 
The devils pawns are on the rise 
Foreseeking vengeance from the lives that they have known 
Injecting thorns for peril or a snare for sin 

[Chorus] 

The smoke is swept away as this encounter slows 
The prince of darkness overthrown 
The angel's rage has proved victorious as known 
The evil underground shall threaten nevermore 

[Chorus]
