FALLOUT

tried to escape, fallout
All around me, yeah

The blast of light, burning day and night
It would last through time, 
with an unseen spark of life

[Chorus:]
Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is his breath of air
The stars above glance fateful stares

Looking back I'd wonder why
No one helped, they'd just stand by
They need to look the other way
To breed the fallout, the final day

The blast of light, a laugh at our fright
The fallout ending time, the fallout far and wide

[Chorus]
Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Speak of man in the past tense
Speak of man who made no sense

Who believes in leadership?
Armed to the teeth, he's well equipped
Well bestowed since man's birth
Hell below, hell on earth

Come and see the show, 
said the stars as they gazed below
See the fallout strip away their future and all their
yesterdays

[Chorus:]
Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is their breath of air
The stars above watch from their lair

The blast of light, burning day and night
It would last trough time 
with an unseen spark of life

[Chorus:]
Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is his breath of air
The stars above glance fateful stares

Who on earth wants to hear a rhyme?
Of the end of birth, of the end of time
Hear these words, don't wonder why
