DARK TALE

Rising higher it grasps the sky overturning it's sense of time 
Bound in iron strong hand break free denounced it's capture with raging flee 
Its streams of colors blinds all keen eyes 
Incandescent power its dark spirit flies 
Focus, seize it, flee it, strife 
Weak minds they wonder the weak must bow down 
Rising from down under it's advanced mind astounds 

Flagrance enlightens it draws you near 
Then sends you broken deep filled with fear 
The fear to realize what shall be done 
Taking sinners, liars, cheats, for their souls he's come 
Conceive, lured, realize, deceived 

A dark tale spoken from past told word 
One who disconcerns himself towards fate he's lured 
Devise a motion beyond what's true 
Or the air that will surround you is what no man ever knew 
An act of mental warfare to strengthen evil form 
Raise the deceased wicked ruler to repeat times moral wrongs
