FEAR ITSELF

Into the madness, and back out of sight
Like ten thousand strong, we burn on through the night
An endless vision, carries us through life
The fear that breaks down all the rest
Dares not to doubt our might

A vein of violence, bleeds pulse into our veins
Always when the smoke is clear, 
Our union still remains
We're opposition, oppressors of the norm
The fear that seems to flourish
Shall always be ignored

[Chorus:]
Fear, it tempts our lives
There's nothing to fear
It's just a lie
Fear, it's in yourself
There's nothing to fear
But fear itself

Hear the losers, their tears won't dry
The beggars and choosers, afraid to die
To last nine lives, but while we're here
We don't run or hide

[Repeat chorus]

In this life, there comes a time
When the fear around you, takes you off your stride
With two cold faces of low and high
Follow us, we'll help you decide
You'll never know if you never try

[Repeat chorus]
