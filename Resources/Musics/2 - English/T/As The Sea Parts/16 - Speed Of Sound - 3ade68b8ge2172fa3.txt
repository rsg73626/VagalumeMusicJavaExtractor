SPEED OF SOUND

I've followed traces of the steps before
I've passed away now, into peaceful war
Nearing now I see I have longed to be
Taken by the hand of the faceless one who stands
Now I undergo the change of life foretold
Growing on to me and now I soon shall be

Soaring blindly in a race through borrowed time
And beside me a race of souls who ride
Growing on me the wings of flight in empty space
Is it terror propelling us into the chase

[Chorus:]

I'm timeless bound from the speed of sound
And the move that's endless all around
And with this space I share all the souls who bare
Heavy weight turning loose falling to the ground

As the sun falls dark we have made our mark
It captures me to know I have doused the final spark

[Chorus]

It's never ending our lungs have burst with might
Souls of this speed spectors soar through the night
Into stardom then beyond who knows?
The speed of sound is broke and onward we are bold!
