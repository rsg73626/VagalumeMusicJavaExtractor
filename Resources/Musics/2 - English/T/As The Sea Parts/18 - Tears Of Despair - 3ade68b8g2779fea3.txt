TEARS OF DESPAIR

Open Your Eyes And Face Reality
Blind Leading The Blind
The Misery That We Inflict Upon
One Another, In The End
Will Destroy Us All

Cries From A Far Distant Land
Their Sorrowful Weep For Help
Will Remain Unanswered
They Will Die In Solitude
To Be Alone Forever More
Rest In Peace....

I've Lost All Hope
My Dreams Shattered
Only To Live A Lie
It's A Matter Of Time....
