WIELDING IRON FISTS

Death's rain falls upon us I see the times' arrival at hand 
In rows aligned we march now drawn from these careful plans 
Starved in this militia we hunger now for the fight 
End this painful awaiting our gallant fate arrives tonight 

Now here it comes the force we seek it breaks the dark with laser streak 
We break down tremendous heat I count the ranks too far to see 
We grip the iron close at hand they rip our armour to useless strands 
We see the dead scattered in their tribes 
We feel their souls soar towards the sky 

[Chorus:] 

Iron fists it's terror twists you've yet to feel it's gleam insist 
So join the lines to keep in time it's iron wields from armoured wrists 
You're drawing near you must compare the clash of fighting iron fists 

The coupled forces gain a step ahead 
But then fall back from which the ground they tread 
Throw down their weapons make for the flee 
Break from this havoc is their final plea 

[Chorus]
