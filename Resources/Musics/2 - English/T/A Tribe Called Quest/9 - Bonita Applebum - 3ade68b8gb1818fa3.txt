BONITA APPLEBUM

Do I love you? 
Do I lust for you? 
Am I a sinner 'cause I do the two? 
Could you let me know 
Right now, please 
Bonita applebum 

Chorus: 

Bonita applebum,
 You gotta put me on (repeat 4x) 

Q-tip: 

(pause between every verse) 
Hey bonita, glad to meet ya 
For the kind of stunning newness,
 I must have foreseen ya 
Hey, being with you is a top priority 
Ain't no need
 To question the authority 
Chairman of the board,
 The chief of affections 
You got mine's to swing in your direction 
Hey, you're like a hip hop song, you know? 
Bonita applebum, you gotta put me on 

Chorus 

38-24-37 (uh, uh, uh!) 
You and me, hun,
 We're a match made in heaven 
I like to kiss ya
 Where some brothas won't 
I like to tell ya
 Things some brothas don't 
If only you could see 
Through your elaborate eyes 
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies 
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics 
And if you need 'em,
 I got crazy prophylactics 
So far, I hope you like rap songs 
Bonita applebum, you gotta put me on 

Chorus
