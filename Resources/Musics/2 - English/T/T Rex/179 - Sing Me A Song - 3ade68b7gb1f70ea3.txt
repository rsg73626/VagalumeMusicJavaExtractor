SING ME A SONG

Hey, Hey... 

Sing me a song that the world can sing along 
And I'll show you a song that stands for living 
Sing me a song that the world can sing along 
And I'll show you a song from the heart 

White, blinding light, that's so bright 
It enfolds you 
Scream that's your dream, it's so real 
It remoulds you 

Sing me a song that the world can sing along 
And I'll show you a song that stands for living 
Sing me a song that the world can sing along 
And I'll show you a song from the heart 

Yeah, Yeah 

White, blinding light, that's so bright 
It enfolds you 

Sing me a song that the world can sing along 
And I'll show you a song that stands for living 
Sing me a song that the world can sing along
