MISTY MIST

Highways mine the Mountains of the Moon (Moon) 
Midnight is a sound singing Cupid's tune (tune) 
Only seeing is believing in the Temple of the Sun (Sun) 
Where silver swords dug a misty morning sun (sun) 
Jump as sunlight skims the sky 
Downstairs radiation burns my eyes (eyes) 
Darkness is a sound of the morning sun 
And the misty mist despoils the morning fun 
Farewell lost love, Black-gloved Woman known 
To the Prince of  Lies, as a metal stone 
The friend sees us smile, he smiles to the two 
In the misty mist encircles both me and you
