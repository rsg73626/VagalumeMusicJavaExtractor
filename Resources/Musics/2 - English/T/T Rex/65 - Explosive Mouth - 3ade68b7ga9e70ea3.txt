EXPLOSIVE MOUTH

Now I'm poppin' a few in the morning dew 
Do the monkey wrench, 
on a persian bench it's a teenage night 
and the vampires are right 

And I want to lay my lips on your explosive mouth 

Picked up Kenny at the art-deco deli, 
And Zero is a cat with any automated hat 
And I need to be rid of the fantasies I'm hiding 

And I want to lay my lips on your explosive mouth 

It's a shame for a man to hide all the things 
that do survive from his past 

When I jump on your horse I gallop the course, 
And howl like a wolf and I drink up the sky 
And I beat on my chest just to punk up the rest 

And I want to lay my lips on your explosive mouth 
And I want to lay my lips on your explosive mouth 

It's a shame for a man to hide all the things
