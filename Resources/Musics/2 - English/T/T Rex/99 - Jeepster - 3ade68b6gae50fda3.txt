JEEPSTER

You're so sweet, you're so fine
I want you all and ev'rything just to be mine
'Cos you're my baby, 'cos you're my love
Oh girl I'm just a jeepster for your love

You slide so good with bones so fair
You've got the universe reclining in your hair
'Cos you're my baby, yes you're my love
Oh girl I'm just a jeepster for your love

Just like a car you're pleasing to be hold
I'll call you Jaguar if I may be so bold
'Cos you're my baby, 'cos you're my love
Oh girl I'm just a jeepster for your love - oh

The wild winds blow upon your frozen cheeks
The way you flip your hip it always makes me weak
'Cos you're my baby, 'cos you're my love
Oh girl I'm just a jeepster for your love - oh

Your motivation is so sweet
Your vibrations are all burning up my feet
'Cos you're my baby, mmh, 'cos you're my love
Oh girl I'm just a jeepster for your love
I said girl I'm just a vampire for your love
I'm gonna suck you

Oh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o wow
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a ow, wow yeah, vampire!
