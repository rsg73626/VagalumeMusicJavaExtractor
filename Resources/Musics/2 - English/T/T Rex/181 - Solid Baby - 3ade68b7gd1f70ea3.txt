SOLID BABY

Oh baby who's the solid baby 
Who's gonna love me tonight 
Oh baby who's the solid baby 
Who's gonna love me tonight 
Tonight, who's gonna love me tonight 

Ooh baby, I'm the gentliest baby 
I'll be stroking tonight 
Ooh baby, I'm the gentliest baby 
I'll be stroking till light 
Tonight, yes tonight 

(Oh baby, who's the solid baby) 
Well don't you know that I am 
(Oh baby, who's the solid baby) 
Can't you hear me cryin' 
(Oh baby, who's the solid baby) 
Ooh it's got to be me * 

Solid baby who's the solid baby 
Who's gonna love me tonight 
Solid baby who's the solid baby 
Please treat me right 
Tonight, yes tonight
