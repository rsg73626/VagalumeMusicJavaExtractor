THE FRIENDS

0 Satyr come 
and suck my thumb 
'cos you're a little fawn 
and you need me. 

On hoofy feet 
through the windy wheat 
'cos you're a little fawn 
and I'll feed thee. 

Down the delly way 
with your belly grey 
I've some fruit and nuts 
and a reed 0. 

And I'll skip with you 
in the midnight blue 
and carve fluting pipes 
for you to play on. 

In the deeply dark 
when the wolves loom large 
I've a snuggly nook 
'neath the meadow. 

Where you'll sleep and be 
curled and friends with me 
through the evil night 
till starling morning.
