TRELAWNY LAWN

The flowing mane of pain swells on Trelawny Lawn 
Stark handsome eyes decide the unicorn 
Is a beast of borrowed wisdom 
Like a thrush in the yielding harvest field 
The prophet deems snow. 

The silent stork of sadness scans Trelawny Lawn 
The lion, the unicorn it's horn in the lap of Beth 
Laments the dawn 
Beguiled, the scribish jacket-man his cap a skull-of-rat 
Is but a pawn. 

0 sky, your eyes embrace is to vicious for my wheat 
The foaming Earthguard whinneys to his leaden feet 
The bullfinch rumbles 
The lavish lion aslanically scythes the hay
