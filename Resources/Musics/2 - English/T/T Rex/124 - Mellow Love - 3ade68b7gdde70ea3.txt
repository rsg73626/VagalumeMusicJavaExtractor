MELLOW LOVE

Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm 
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm 
I want some mellow love 
Mellow love I want it 
I want some mellow love 
Mellow love I want it 

I.... want some love 
I.... want some love 

I want some mellow love 

Mellow love I want it 
Don't want no zero chick 
No zero chick to love me 
Don't want cosmetic stick 
Just want someone to hug me 

I.... want some love 
I.... want some love 
I want some mellow love, love 

Take me girl 
Make me girl 
I'll be the only one you need 
Take me girl 
Make me girl 
I'll be the only one you need 
Mellow love 

I want some mellow love 
Mellow love I want it 
I want some mellow love 
Mellow love I want it 

Repeat till fade....
