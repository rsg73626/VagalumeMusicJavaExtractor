VENUS LOON

Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon, 
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon 

Slipshod gymslip in my neighbourhood, 
Empty head, steel bed, Dipseys no good 
All alone, no telephone, to hype up my baby, 
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon, 
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon 

Bent spent, psychedelic mailman's head, 
Gorging up my spokes like the ghostly dead 
Ally pally angel chewing up my blues, 
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon, 
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon 

Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon, 
It'll make you feel good 
It'll make you feel good 
Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon, 
It'll make you feel good 
It'll make you feel good 

First girl I ever met I don't recognise 
Her nose is smashed her frame is bent 
She's covered in flies 
Everyone I ever loved, I'll love 'till I die 
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon, 
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon 

Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon, 
It'll make you feel good 
It'll make you feel good. 
Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon, 
It'll make you feel good 
It'll make you feel good.
