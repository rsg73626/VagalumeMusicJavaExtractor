PRECIOUS STAR

Like a precious star 

Ooh like a precious star you are, 
Ooh like a precious star you are, 
I wanna spend my life with you 
Ooh like a precious star you are, 
And will you love me

Ooh like the silver moon above 
Is the night right for love, 
Ooh like the silver moon above 
Is the night right for love,

Ooh like a precious star you are,
