CRY BABY

Kissed you in the show, you ran and told your mama 
You're a cry baby 
In the hall against the wall, you made it all so clear 
You're a cry baby 
Your love was like a summer in my heart 
And then you lied baby 
Clouds of doubt messin' up my sky 
You're such a cry baby 

Ooh, since you let me down, even though I joke around 
You know I'm sad baby 

I'm a queen without a throne 
All alone and almost grown 
Don't need no sly baby 

Your love was like a summer in my heart 
And then you lied baby 
Clouds of doubt messin' up my sky 
You're such a cry baby 

Balled you in the show, you ran and told your mama 
You're a cry baby 
In the hall against the wall, you made it all so clear 
You're such a cry baby 

You're such a cry baby, wo-oo 
You're such a cry baby, wo-oo
