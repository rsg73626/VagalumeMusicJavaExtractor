GOLDEN BELT

Well baby, baby don't ya know 
Your hair's a lair and one to spare 
I need you girl 
Oh yeah.* 

Be good you know your trips 
You're so rare, there's no one there 
Hold my head between your knees.** 

Hey baby jump in your car 
We'll go to the sun and have us some fun 
I love you child 
Oh yeah. 

Long day runs into night 
Twilight child, you drive me wild 
Don't scare me now 
Oh yeah. 

Gold belt, strap round my head 
Rock 'n' Roll on the oceans floor 
Now get down girl 
Oh yeah.*** 

Be glad to get there 
My love is strong like a mist at dawn 
Don't get me wrong 
Oh yeah yeah yeah.****
