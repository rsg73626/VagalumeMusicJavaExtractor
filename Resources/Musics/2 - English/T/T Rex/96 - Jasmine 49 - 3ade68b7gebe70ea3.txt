JASMINE 49

Jasmine 49 baby, is a number that ain't mine 
Drinking scented tea with someboy on your knee 
and that somebody ain't me, no 
Jasmine 49 is a number that is fine 
Jasmine 49 baby, is a number that ain't mine 
And don't let it ever be said 
That I'm crazy in the head 
From drinking scented tea with nobody else but me, and 
Jasmine 42 is a number I gave to you 
Jasmine 43 babe is a number you gave to me 

Jasmine 49 baby,  is a buzz that's so divine 
And I can't think of anybody less inclined 
To go out and blow their mind and realize everything 
That they do and fantasize everything that's true 
Jasmine 49 baby, is a buzz that's so d-d-d-divine 

Jasine 49 babe, is a buzz that just ain't mine.
