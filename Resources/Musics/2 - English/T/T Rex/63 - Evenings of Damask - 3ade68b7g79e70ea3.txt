EVENINGS OF DAMASK

The evenings of Damask are falling 
The youth of truth chest 
Feeds a starling 
With his heart. 

A chosen man begged by the wayside 
A horse came soon and died before him 
And said eat. 

The icy claws of earth are crawling 
Upon my baby's brow and calling 
Please come home. 

The boy unlike the man was smiling 
For gulleys, streams and hills would hide him 
Like a swan. 

A vagabond, a weaver warrior 
Produced a loom, a cheese and chopper 
And said choose. 

My sandled feet are fleet like water 
I kiss the limbs is Earthess daughter
