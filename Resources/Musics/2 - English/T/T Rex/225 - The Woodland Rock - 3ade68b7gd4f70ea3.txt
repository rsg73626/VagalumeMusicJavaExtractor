THE WOODLAND ROCK

There's a man on the corner 
Got his head in his hat 
He dances like a gypsy 
so he must be where it's at. 
Do the rock 
do the woodland rock 
Let it all hang out, 
Everybody shout, 
Do the rock - do the woodland rock. 
The wind is the thing 
That makes the body swing 
It brings you up and takes you down 
And treats you like a king 
Do the rock 
Do the woodland rock 
Let it all hang out, 
Everybody shout 
Do the rock - do the woodland rock. 

Met a little momma 
She was sweet, she was gone 
She's got legs like a railroad 
Face like a song 
Do the rock 
Do the woodland rock 
Let it all hang out, 
Everybody shout 
Do the rock - do the woodland rock. 

Wind is in the willows 
My house is up a tree 
The seas of change are flowing 
I want everybody free 
To do the rock - do the woodland rock 
Let it all hang out, 
Everybody shout 
Do the rock - do the woodland rock. 

Met a little momma 
She was sweet, she was gone 
She's got legs like a railroad 
Face like a song 
Do the rock 
Do the woodland rock 
Let it all hang out, 
Everybody shout 
Do the rock - do the woodland rock. 

Ally bally bash bam 
Rock-a-billy boom 
Do the rock 
Do the woodland rock 
Let it all hang out, 
Everybody shout 
Do the rock - do the woodland rock.
