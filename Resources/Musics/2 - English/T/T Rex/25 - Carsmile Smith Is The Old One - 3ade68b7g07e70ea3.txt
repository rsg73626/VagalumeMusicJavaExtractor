CARSMILE SMITH IS THE OLD ONE

Carsmile Smith he's the old one 
Don't you know he's the good one 

Don'tcha, don'tcha 

Bessy stood by the side of the grave 
Like a woman of love would do 
She hung her hands into a knot of grief 
For a man she never knew 
Carsmile Smith he's the old one 
Don't you know that he's the good one 

Don'tcha, don'tcha 

Carsmile Smith he's the old one Don't you know he's the good one 

Don'tcha, don'tcha 

Bessy stood by the side of the grave 
Like a woman of love would do 
She hung her hands into a knot of grief 
For a man she never knew
