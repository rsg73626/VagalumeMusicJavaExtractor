THE SEAL OF SEASONS

The seal of seasons moved with grace 
Love 
Upon the Orkney oceans face 
Love 
She swam and moved 
Just like a prancer 
A gypsy dancer 
A salty shimmered shell of foam. 

Out of the depths she stood before me 
One breath and shells grew on my nut tree 
It swayed and swum 
Just like a prancer 
A gypsy dancer 
A salty shimmered shell of foam. 

Her night it came and then she hooked her head 
Unto the fleeing sun and then she fled 
And flew whou 
Just like a prancer 
A gypsy dancer 
A salty shimmered shell of foam.
