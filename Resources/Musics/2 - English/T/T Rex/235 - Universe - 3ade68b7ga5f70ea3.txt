UNIVERSE

Interplanetary Waltz 

Hey there sister 
Let's face the Universe and dance 
Hey there sister 
Let's face the Universe and dance 

We'll bop over the galaxies 
We'll stroll over to Mars 
We'll romance on Jupiter 
Make love among the stars 

If you really love me sister 
Let's face the Universe and dance 
If you really love me sister
