WARLORD OF THE ROYAL CROCODILES

Handsome as life 
He's our lord and we trust in him 
To move like the wind 
As our friend and guardian. 

The elements and oceans congregate on his brow 
And he stalks in style like a royal crocodile. 

His chariot legs 
Are tree green and autumn brown 
His crown of dusk is a glimpse of things to be. 

In palaces and temples near the dwellings of man
