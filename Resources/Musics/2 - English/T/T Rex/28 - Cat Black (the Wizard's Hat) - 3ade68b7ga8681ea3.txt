CAT BLACK (THE WIZARD'S HAT)

Catblack the wizard's hat 
Spun in lore from Dagamoor 
The skull of jade was pearl inlaid 
The silks, skin spun, repelled the Sun 
A tusk of boar with dwarfish awe 
Sobs on the door where stood before 
A mountain man with sky-blue teeth 
Upon his head a python's wreath 
A deer he slew in the dawning's dew 
Her heart was a dagger for a murderer's brew. 

A toad of jet on a sill cast in brass 
Portrayed for his sight mysteries of the past 
A yellow orphan dancer rich in Nature's costly gold 
Wept for the jailer of time to bless her old 
But his kiss he held and shadowed for the spell of nights are strong 
And spiralled like a whirlwind in the childhood of a song 

Catblack the wizard's back 
Daubed in doom in his tounge tombed room 
We of the wind must rejoice and speak
