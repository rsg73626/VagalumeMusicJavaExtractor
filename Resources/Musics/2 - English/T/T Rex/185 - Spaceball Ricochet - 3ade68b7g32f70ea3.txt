SPACEBALL RICOCHET

I'm just a man 
I understand the wind 
And all the things 
That make the children cry 
With my Les Paul 
I know I'm small 
But I enjoy living 
Anyway 

Book after book 
I get hooked 
Everytime the writer 
Talks me like a friend 
What can I do 
We just live in a zoo 
All I do is play 
The spaceball ricochet 

Deep in my heart 
There's a house 
That can hold 
Almost all of you 
I bought a car 
It was old but kind 
I gave it my mind 
And it disappeared 

I love a girl 
She is a changeless angel 
She's a city it's a pity 
That I'm like me 
I said how can I lay 
When all I do is play
