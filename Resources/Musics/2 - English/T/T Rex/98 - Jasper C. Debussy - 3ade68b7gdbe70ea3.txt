JASPER C. DEBUSSY

Jasper was fine but he had glass eyes 
He crucified me with his pixie coloured lies 
His hair was black, he had a bend in his back 
He tied my cousin Eddy to the railroad tracks 
The train it come, he started to run 
Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun 
Jasper was born with a moth in his mind 
The moth was too soft on the curtain behind 
He startled the face of a friend of my girl's 
He cut out her eyes and  he wore them with furs 
I get half the dues, wear my shoes 
Tonight you might laugh while crying the news 
'Cos Jasper C. Debussy, that's his kind of blues 

Mama 

Jasper he dressed in the darkest of clothes 
He wears scarlet pantaloons and five foot one inch hose 
His face is like a rock and his eyes like the night 
He's like a grim faced dog that's looking for a fight 
 Silhouette looks like a furry Persian rat 
When you see him coming mama, you'd better run 
Because Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun
