SUN EYE

Love you 
Oh girl I do 
Love you 

Come the sun 
See it run 
Across the sky 
Cosmic eye 
Is for you 
And no one else 

Love you 
Oh girl I do 
Love you 

Come the sun 
See it run 
Across the sky 
See it cry 
For you 
And no one else 

Tree wizard puretongue 
The digger of holes 
The swan king 
The Elf lord 
The eater of souls 
Lithon the black 
The rider of stars 
Tyrannosaurus Rex 
The eater of cars.
