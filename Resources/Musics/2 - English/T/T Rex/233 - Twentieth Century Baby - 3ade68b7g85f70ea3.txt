TWENTIETH CENTURY BABY

The highlight of my life was meeting you 
That windy autumn day at Malibu 
Your diamond eyes that shine 
The rubies of your mind 
Girl, be my Twentieth Century Baby 

Love comes but once to men, the wise men say 
I knew that must be true, that L.A. day 
Your face was heaven sent 
My mind red hot to rent
