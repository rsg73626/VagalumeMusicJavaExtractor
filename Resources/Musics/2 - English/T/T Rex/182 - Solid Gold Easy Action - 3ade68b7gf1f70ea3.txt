SOLID GOLD EASY ACTION

Life is the same
And it always will be
Easy as picking foxes from a tree
But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action
A stud is a lamb
With the thoughts of a tiger
Who moves like a cat
And knows how to ride her
A woman from the east with her headlights shining
eased my pain and stopped my crying
And all my hair will keep her smiling
With my wondrous walk and my telephone dialing
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action
