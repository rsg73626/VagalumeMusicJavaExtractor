YOU'VE GOT TO JIVE TO STAY ALIVE (SPANISH MIDNIGHT)

You gotta jive jive to stay alive 
You gotta jive jive to stay alive 
I'm a silver stud, I ain't no stick in the mud 
And everything I do I do for you 

You gotta jive jive to stay alive 
You gotta jive jive to stay alive 

Spanish Midnight 
Spanish Midnight all I want to do is love you tonight
