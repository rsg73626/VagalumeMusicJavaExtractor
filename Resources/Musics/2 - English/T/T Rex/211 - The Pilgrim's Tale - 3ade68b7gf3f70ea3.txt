THE PILGRIM'S TALE

Beauty things sing to me 
As a chorus 
As a flock the wild seas 
Sway before us 

Hail as a hand is my mail 
The thrush is my love 
And the whale is a snail 

Sailors dance in a trance 
On the ocean 
Fairy lights in her eyes 
Tame the water 

With the morn we mount and ride 
Pilgrims of summer 
The swift is our guide 

Dazzle dawn man 
Mouthed with a smile 
Caution cloud lord 
Stay for a while
