CHROME SITAR

Standing on a corner 
Of the chrome sitar 
Everybody ask who the hell you are 
Somebody scream and shout, somebody spoke 
Somebody said that life is just a joke ** 

So come on, little girl 
Won't you hold my hand 
Come on, little girl 
Don't you understand 
Come on little girl, yea, yea 

Love is grand, won't you hold my hand - tonight 

Princess outrage with deductable grave 
Scream of her love but you know I was brave 
Octoganic angel, measuring the stars
