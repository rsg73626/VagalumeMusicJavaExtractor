ORGAN BLUES

There's gold in the mountains 
And a people living in the sea 

I love you and don't you know 
That you love me 
Yes you do 

We make feasties of the beasties 
But the beasties just live in the wild 

You know that you're slower now 
And you were faster when you were 
A child 
Yes you were.
