OH HARLEY (THE SALTIMBANQUES)

Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose 
No bigger than a bubby's thumb. 
Medieval dublet, elk horn ornamented woodland trumpet, 
Cradling your musket son. 

Harlequin stands magnificent 
Slaughtered tulip in the psalm of his lillywhite. 
Harlequin stands theatrical 
Mincing smirk dancing on the hip of his lip. 

Oh Harley 

Naughty to pretend it's so naughty so bad 0 harley 

Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose, 
No bigger than a bubby's thumb 
Garlanded with bluebells strewn with silver birch
