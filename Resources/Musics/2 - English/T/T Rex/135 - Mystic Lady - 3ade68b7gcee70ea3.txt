MYSTIC LADY

Baby Mystic Lady 
You do own my night 
Put my dogs to fright 
Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea 

Riding sliding Sorceress 
In your dungarees 
Got me on my knees 

The people in your life are cruel 
Keep on riding that hard road 
The lovers in you life are few 
Keep on riding that hard road 

Pleasant crescent moon 
Fills my heart with pain 
Fills my toes with rain 

Oh Bobby you're hobby 
With the learned ones
