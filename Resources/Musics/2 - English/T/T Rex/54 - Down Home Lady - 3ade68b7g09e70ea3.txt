DOWN HOME LADY

Down Home Lady, Down Home Lady 
All I wanna do is be with you tonight 
Oooh yeah 
Down Home Lady, Down Home Lady 
All I wanna do is be with you tonight 

When the breeze is cold, I will sing to you 
That you're my 
Down Home Lady, Down Home Lady 
All I wanna do is be with you tonight 

When the breeze is cold, I will sing to you 
That you're my 
Down Home Lady, Down Home Lady 
All I wanna do is be with you tonight 

(Mmmm, nice one Cyril, ...)
