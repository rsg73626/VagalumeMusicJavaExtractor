CHRISTMAS BOP

Christmas....T. Rexmas 
Christmas 
Everybody's gotta do the Christmas Bop, yeah 
Hey baby, lend me your ear 
Christmas time is drawing near 
Get ot your silk jeans 
And your space shoes 
I've got some sweet, wild, devastating news 

Chrsitmas, here comes the fun 
Christmas, we're gonna have some fun 
Christmas, gonna dance till we drop 
Everybody's gotta do the Christmas Bop 

Yeah, summer's gone and snow's fallen down 
I'm gonna miss that golden, surfing sound 
But cold's bold and there's nothing wrong 
We're dressed sweet while I'm singing my song 

Christmas....T. Rexmas 
Christmas 
Everybody's gotta do the Christmas Bop, yeah 

Hey baby, lend me your ear 
Christmas time is drawing near 
Get on your silk jeans 
And your space shoes 
I've got some sweet, wild, devastating news 

Christmas....T. Rexmas 
Christmas 
Everybody's gotta do the Christmas Bop, yeah 
[repeat Chorus to fade]
