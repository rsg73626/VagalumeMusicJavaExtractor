THUNDERWING

I was walking down the skyway my way
When I saw the legs that I love
I was thinking about drinking something
When I saw the legs that I love
I bought a car 'twas a low slung thunderwing
It moved like the sun of the dawn
My little baby she's a tip-a-toed vamp rider
She moves like the sun of the dawn
Ooh
Yeah, get it on
Do your thing,
love on the Thunderwing
Do your thing, love on the Thunderwing
Yeah
Get it on, get it on whooo
Well my wings had grooves
And my baseball boots bounce
When I hear the music I love
A soapbox chord was the start of my wandering
