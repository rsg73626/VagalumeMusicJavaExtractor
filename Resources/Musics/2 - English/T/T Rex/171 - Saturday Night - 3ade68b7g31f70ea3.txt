SATURDAY NIGHT

I went down to your place baby 
On a Saturday night 
Everyone we knew was there 
But you were out of sight 
There was Neon Henry 
With the flashing head 
I knew him well 
But any place is outer space 
Without my girl 
And I'm singing

I went down to your place baby 
On a Saturday night 
Everyone we knew was there 
But you were out of sight

There was pig-face Kim 
I knew her well 
But where were you> 
Everyone we knew was there 
But without you there seemed so few 
And I'm singing

Repeat first two verses to fade....
