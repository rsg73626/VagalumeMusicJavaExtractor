SOUND PIT

Basil Dazzle and her dissolving city 
Stella Gazelle and the distraction I bought her 
I wonder why, oh why 

Debra Zebra and the disgusting gawk 
Malice to Pallas at the all night palace, with Alice 
I wonder why I wonder why 

Metal Guru's in the loo with my glue, yeah, 
Telegram Sam bought some land in Milan, 
I wonder why 

Thin faced Sally skinned a cat in my alley 
Dawn sunstorm minister of doom, in your tomb 
I wonder why
