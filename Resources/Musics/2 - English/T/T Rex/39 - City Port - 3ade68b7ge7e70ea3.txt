CITY PORT

City port, city port, city-city-city port
I went to the city port
City port took my blues away
I went to the city port
City port took my blues away, yes they did
I lost all my city cool
When I bought your midget show
I grew all debonaire
When I had the 1980's air, in your hair
That's right
I went to the city sight
A young love took my soul away
Peering eyes and Persian skies, removed my eyes
And took them right away, took them all away
Just like
I lost all my city cool
When I bought your midget show
City Port
And it took them, took them all away
And it took them, took them all away
City Port
