THE AVENGERS (SUPERBAD)

Superbad tiger running with your brain 
Tucked beneath your arms like a devil train 
When the angels from the heavens 
Meet the angels from the earth 
You'll hide inside your cave, that's right of course 

And we know, we ain't slow, we're the avengers! 

I have known lots of ladies and the ladies know me, 
I've been foxy roxy punctured and I'm funky born free 
You can needle treacle kiss me 
With the honey from your mouth 
But believe me I'm a bad moon bopster 
And I'll never come in your house 

And we know, we ain't slow, we're the avengers! 

Dig this... 

And we know, we ain't slow, we're the avengers! 
And we know, we ain't slow, we're the avengers!
