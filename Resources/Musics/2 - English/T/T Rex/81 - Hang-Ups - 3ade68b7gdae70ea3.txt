HANG-UPS

Play in a loud cloud 

When I'm down you bring me up, babe 
When I'm up you bring me down 
When I'm down you bring me up, babe 
When I'm up you bring me down 
I'm such a contradiction - I'm just hung-up 

Get off my back and leave me 
Oh shit, let's get it on 
Get off my back and leave me 
Oh shit, let's get it on 
I'm such a contradiction - I'm just hung-up 

I'm such a contradiction - I'm just hung-up 
Everything is sweet babe 
Then everything is the pits 
Everything is sweet babe 

Then everything is the pits 
You love me then you leave me 
How come you always pick the hits?
