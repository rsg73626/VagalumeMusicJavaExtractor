CASUAL AGENT

Oh I wanna be your casual agent 
I wanna be your casual agent 

Casual agent moving by the sand 
Cosmetic Betty stealing from the skull 
Madonna dollar destroyed by the holy roof 
I know to move my child to switch 
Without your tooth 

Distorted contortionist barely 
Saved his cool 
As he rubberised Hannah by the 'lectric school 
With the planetary pearl 
And the magnetic fool who were 
Both told and rolled to look alike 
And welded to a stool 

Wind of illusion came darkly down my street 
Lead were my eyelids, demented were my feet 
And the two faced detector from the 
Malibu beach, dejected like Delilah she 
Sucked upon my perch 

All night worker for the missionary stand 
I seldom drip glue, in the video grand 
Tiger tongued tinse, see the old queens 
Of the night, were stone cold stiletto-toed
