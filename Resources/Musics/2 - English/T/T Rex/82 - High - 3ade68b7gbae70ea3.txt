HIGH

Flowers blown on the wind at night 
Lovers' prayer brings heart strings tight 
My summer was blown to a winter's throne 
High, high, high 

Riding fast on the path at night 
Unaware of a lover's right 
To be gone and destroy your song 

Oh,, high, high, high 

Oh 
Many changes my young life has seen, yeah 
People feel that true love's a dream 
My faith was wrong 
God will help me carry on 

High, high, high, oh 

I wanna take you a high, girl 
I wanna take you a high, boy
