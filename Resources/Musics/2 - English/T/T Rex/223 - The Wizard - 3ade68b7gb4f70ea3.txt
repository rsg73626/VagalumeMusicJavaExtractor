THE WIZARD

Walking in the woods one day 
I met a man who said that he was magic 
Wonderful things he said 
Pointed hat upon his head 
Knew why people laughed and cried 
Why they lived and why they died 

Shadows followed him around 
He walked the woods without a single sound 
Golden eagles at his door 
Cats and bats played on the floor 
Silver sunlight in his eyes 
The wizard turned and melted in the sky.
