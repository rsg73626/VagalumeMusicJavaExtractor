TELL ME NOW

Tell me baby, tell me now 
Baby whisper in my ear 
Words of winter sun 
Baby tell me all you gear 
Tell me what you've done 

Oh, tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 

Baby please remember me 
When you fly the skies, ooh darlin' 
Riches now consume your soul 
I see it in your eyes 

Oh, tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Oooh darlin, yeah, yeah... 

You gotta tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 

We're so happy with these fears 
Help me ease the pain. Oh, darlin' 
Try to break these chains that hold 
His face inside my brain 

Oh, tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Tell me now (tell me baby) 
Tell me now (tell me now) 

Help me now, help me baby 
Help me now, help me now 
Oooh, oooh, yeah oooh, yeah 

I-ay need some help now baby 
I-ay, need some help now baby 

repeat till fade...
