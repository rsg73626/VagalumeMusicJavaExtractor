JASON B. SAD

A distant friend of Johnny B. Goode 

Jason B. Sad was a lonely lad 
His head was a bed for everyone 
His clothes was his life 
but his heart was a knife 
Inscribed on it was "rock 'n' roll is cruel" 

Take me to school, boy 
Leave me alone, boy 
Slice me a bone of the Universe 
Take me to school, boy 
Leave me alone, boy 
Slice me a bone of the Universe 

Jason got weird and he pierced his ears 
A gypsy alone in his gallantry 
He met Shaky Sue, who wore only blue 
And they shared in their teenage misery 

Then Jason read books and wore hard looks 
He swapped Sue for an artisan 
His winters were long and a fantastic song
