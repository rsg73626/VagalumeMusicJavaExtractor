THE MISTY COAST OF ALBANY

Weeping willow woman 
Ladled on the arm 
Of the misty coast of Albany 
With its charm 
Pining pillar of the wild willows end 
Womanly waiting 
For your manly friend. 

A star 'bove the mire is her husbandly choice 
Locked in his tower 
By the enchanted voice 
Of the Starguard Rhina 
With his lips soiled with gold 
He dares to loiter 
Near our lady bold. 

Once a heart was made and cast 
In molten love 
But t'was in realms of the past.
