PICTURES OF PURPLE PEOPLE

I saw this mirror, I looked through it 
Reflections looked most better than all 
Cared too much, hating hatred 
Seeing things deformed and almost cold 
Crying sadly, shielding gladly my eyes 
From the ugly side of  fat men seeing, almost 
Thin men peeping, sleeping, looking, falling 
Dizzy from their windows high 

The men of magic thinking if evil 
He was bringing sunless children 
Seeing all the bad, 
'Cos beauty was too ugly 
And faceless people 
Wondered at the beautiful forms they had 

Now the mirror's broken 
I'm smiling, seeing good things 
Yet despite foot splinters swirl in the air 
Forever call him beauty 
Children come at night time
