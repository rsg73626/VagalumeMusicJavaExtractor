THE SCENESCOF DYNASTY

Meeting behind the iron sling 
My brandy tongue was like a caterpillar thing 
Suzy-hung up on Joan of Arc 
Cloudily gave me the key to the dark 
Scraping the lice from my bed 
I sussed we were teleported into his head 
A wormy blood train expected our feet 
But I cradled Suzy's head in my lap 
And fitted the stair to her gap 
And led her off the Astral plane 
Sculpting her features in flesh 
Her Alice eyes scan the mythical scene 
And rose on the veiny snake train 
And prayed to his bastille sky brain 
The driver was a cancer growth cell 
His words were just recorded tapes of Hell 
He left us in the room of faded scrolls 
In a window wall we saw a good thought chained 
But knifed into a portion of his brain 
Was a whitish through back to the green Amazon leach 
It was interlocked between his angel eyes 
Which were bleached transparent 
And his marble lips were paralysed 
We swum and ran knee deep in plasma 
The cello stairs reduced in size 
The sunken landscape eclipsing into 
A pair of blue Tazmanian eyes 
Scenescof then became a midget 
Scratching at the bone in my knee 
Then an eat without a body 
Listening to my mental sea 
Suzy sat behind some loose flesh 
Her pirate thoughts were both young and old 
Reduced to wearing blonde lot earings 
She held me near she felt the cold 
We ran just like young fauns 
And me I fought a great worm 
Sent to taste my jaguar feet 
And used his skin to make my wings begin 
I sussed and stole a scene from Icarus 
And flew us above some uncooked meat 
A plastic hook pierced through my Instep 
I flew too near his Brutus heart 
But Suzy hip to all the future 
Played the Victorian heroin's part 
With my basted leg and rusty head 
And Suzy in a Hipolite dream 
I brandished my breathing machette 
While Scenescof prepared his Gorgon machine 
It flew out from its eyelid island 
It's Vulcan teeth and hydra spray 
It's scale y tang claws ripping rainbows 
It moved it's cave lips in worlds of movement 
It makes a sound it seemed to say 
Keep cool the satin sun is yours 
I see your youthy aura's bright 
Expell your tears and jungle fears 
I'm here it's going to be alright 
Then Scenescof screamed his charlatan hair 
Quick silvered from black to grey 
Then the Gorgon moved the lizard dial 
And was transformed into Grecian dust 
And from the sand was born a blacked horned storm 
With a charger and a spear 
As he moved his limbs 
The legend shaft sliced Scenescof from ear to ear.
