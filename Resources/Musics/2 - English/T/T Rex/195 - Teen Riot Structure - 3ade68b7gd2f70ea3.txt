TEEN RIOT STRUCTURE

Teen riot structure, ankle deep in fear 
Babies lost in bellies and the oracle can't hear 
A demon angel demi-god blasted through the night 
Me and Lucy Lightning holding on real tight 

An ancient Lord in wonder rung upon my bell 
I fed him with my nightmares And he ate my dreams as well 
All London was in blazes burning to the sound 
Of deep galactic tragedies in stereophonic sound 

A tempest teen of stature in Gatsby hat and cloak 
Licked upon my lollipop, but I didn't get the joke 
As devastation mounted my wardrobes almost burned 
The teens held hands on shifting sands and wonder what they learnt 

Repeat in toto 

Structure
