OBSERVATIONS

Livin' in the car, make it to the bar 
We'll meet up with the guys who 
Make love to Barbara Striesand 
Then we'll all split the scene 
Make it like a dream 
West Side Brighton, or we're just ridin' 
Turn on the chicks and then we'll blow our kicks 
And we'll fly high 
Boppin' and shoppin' and makin' it in West One 
See ya later, alligator, throw away your Zip Gun 
Dance instead of walking, feel like I'm the best one 
Smokin' charges and ridin' barges, cutting out high strung 
Sleeping on the beaches and make like a teacher 
Turned on beggar, say he's a rockin' preacher 
Steeling or feeling and make like a rocker 
Then you'll fly high 
Met her in the corner [?], King jiving on the sidwalk 
Intellectual put down all I wanna do is talk 
Chelsea cats groovin' and provin' that they're all men 
Callin' up your lost baby, shoutin' out "Remember when.." 
On a scene with the guys, see the paintings in their eyes 
Driving through the crazy night 
Looking for a chick to fight 
Had a seed and made a veil [?] 
Blew some smoke and leave a trail 
And fly high 
I'm wearin' shades and diggin' spades 
I'm takin' in the night life 
Crazy Sally in the alley, playing with a filck-knife 
Met a chick, got a flat 
Got a cat with one leg 
I bought a Jeep, nice and cheap 
For cutting out right now 
Made it to the sea, just the chick, the cat, and me 
everybody's laughing 'cos the Jeep's cost money 
Nice and easy baby said, come and sit down with me
