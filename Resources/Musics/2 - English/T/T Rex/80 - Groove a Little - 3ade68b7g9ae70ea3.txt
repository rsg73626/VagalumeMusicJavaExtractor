GROOVE A LITTLE

To groove is to lubricate your imagination 

You can call somebody captain 
Under pressure you can flip 
You can be a rock commando 
But you can't pilot the ship 

Groove a little baby, groove a little now 
Groove a little baby, you might know what you want 

But I'll show you how 

You can trip the light fantastic 
Become a space grotesque 
You can fossilize your thought dreams 
Behind a rusty desk 

You might know what you want 
But I'll show you how 

You can read the works of Shakespeare 
In the Academy of Life 
You can punk the skunks of freedom
