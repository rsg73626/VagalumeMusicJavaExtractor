SHY BOY

I don't want to be no shy boy 
The one that always cries boy 
And never gets his girl 
Don't you understand that 
I've got to have that girl boy 
To be my pride and joy boy 
To hold her hand 
In this magic land 

I know that I'm a young boy 
A kind of unsung boy 
Not a man of the world 
But baby you know that... 
Love is a wonderful thing, girl 
Turns a prince into a king, girl 
Don't you understand 

And when I'm all alone 
I wait for the telephone 
To ring
