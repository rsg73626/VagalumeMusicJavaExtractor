THE THROAT OF WINTER

O the throat of winter is upon us 
The barren barley fields refuse to sway 
Before the Husky hag of early darkness 
In her hoods of snowy grey. 

Winter winter winter 
Are you but a servant of the bad one. 

Lo the frozen blue birds in the belfries 
The bluebells in their hearts are surely prey 
Unto the grasping bats-wing of the winter pincer 
Hoods of snowy grey.
