OH BABY

Oh baby, ooh, oh baby, oh baby baby
Oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ahh, I want you for my woman
Oh baby baby, oh baby baby, oh
Well I saw a girl yesterday
Thought my life that she was my wife
Once in my life
Well I saw a girl yesterday
Thought my life that she was my wife
Once in my life
And I'm singing
Oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Oh baby baby, Ahhh
I want you for my woman
Oh baby baby, Oh baby baby, yeah
Well I saw a girl yesterday
Thought my life that she was my wife
Once in my life
