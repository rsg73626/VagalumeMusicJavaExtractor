THE LEOPARDS

 (Featuring Gardenia And The Mighty Slug)

We're the leopards (x3) 

The leader of the pack lives down in the local drain, 
We're the leopards 
King Kong built a car inside his brain, 
We're the leopards 
You tell me who's the sexiest, 
But why it's Gardenia & the Mighty Slug 

We're the leopards 

Old Doug Henry lost an ear when he crossed my path 
We're the leopards 
Called himself Jesus, well that's what he said to me 
We're the leopards 

I have never seen a freak look as weird as you 
Except for Gardenia and the Mighty Slug 
We're the leopards 

Cycle Michael grotesque school desk in my brain 
We're the leopards 
Mincing Quincy dropping bop drops down the drain 
We're the leopards 

I'll just tell you boy we're mean and we're tough 
Just like Gardenia and the Mighty Slug 
We're the leopards 

I know that we know that he know it's wrong 
We're the leopards 
To spend your life inside a song 

Greasy Gert tried it and she licked it too 
Just like Gardenia and the Mighty Slug 
We're the leopards 

Uncle Bimbo drunk up the sea of Galilee 
And like a fool he promised it all to me 
But I'm young and built of steel 
Just like Gardenia and the Mighty Slug 

Just like Gardenia and the Mighty Slug 
Just like Gardenia and the Mighty Slug
