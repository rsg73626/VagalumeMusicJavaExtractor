CARSMILE SMITH AND THE OLD ONE

Carsmile Smith he's the Old One 
Dontcha you know that he's the Good One 
Dontcha, dontcha 
Bessy stood by the side of the grave 
Like a woman of love would do 
She hung her hands into a knot of grief 
For a man she never knew 

[Repeat 1st verse twice] 

Repeat 2nd verse] 

Dontcha, dontcha
