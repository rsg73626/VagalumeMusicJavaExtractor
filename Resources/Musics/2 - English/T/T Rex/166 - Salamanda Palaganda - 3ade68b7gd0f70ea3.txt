SALAMANDA PALAGANDA

Small girl with the smiling 'gibbon 
Bridled with an orchid ribbon 
His curved brow in Scarlatti fashion 
Boots that ride the night sky eagle 
An old crone squirms upon a cushion 
Made from Madras silk and satin 
Her steel eyes hold a scimitar passion 
For the skull hewn in Scarlatti fashion. 
A cobra seer with the punctured ear 
Slaughtered a Malayan sun bear 
Night stood erect with brozen haunches 
Zapped the seer and gave the bear back to us 
Salamanda Palaganda Oh Palamino Blue
