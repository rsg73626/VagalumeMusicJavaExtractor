JUNIPER SUCTION

There's a crawling sensation 
An Astral vibration 
That's sucking me into your sight 
I can tell by your hair In the juniper chair 
And the piraty twist of your mouth 
I've constructed your frame In a plasticine game 
And your eyes are the sweets of my youth 
But I'm naked and bare in the ice of your stare 
And I'm useless at telling the truth 
So I hide with my head in the tent of the bed 
And my body is sucked through your eyes 
Then I quiver and shiver and start to deliver the goods
