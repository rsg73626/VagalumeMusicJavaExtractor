THE GROOVER

T . R . E . X.
Some call me Arnie
Some name me Slim
It don't make no difference
'Cos I move right in
They call me the groover
When I'm on the floor
The kids yell for more, more, more
Some call me Starkey
Some named me stud
Yes they do
It don't make no difference
'Cos I move in the mud
I said sing it to me children
Yea I'm the groover honey Yea
I'm the groover honey Yea
I'm the groover honey
Well some call me Jeepster
And some name me lame
It don't make no difference
Man you know what it takes
I'm a groover 'cos I move right in
