THE SOUL OF MY SUIT

Well you damaged the soul of my suit 
You pulled my love out by the roots 
But I'm not such a bad boy - oh no 

You ravished the runes of my tunes 
You put on the gloves of my loves 
But you're not such a bad girl - oh no 

Rock and rolled it even strolled it, baby 
Rock and rolled it, yeah 
Rock and rolled it even strolled it, baby 
Rock and rolled it, yeah 

I love you, yeah
