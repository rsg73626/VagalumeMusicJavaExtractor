MISTER MOTION

O.K. One, two, three, four 
Motion. 
Mister Motion, he made a lotion 
That made him owner of the sky and commander of the ocean 
Motion, he was a bad guy 
He went from head to head injecting lead 
With seeds of deadly nightshade. 
Do diddle do diddle do Motion. 
Do diddle do diddle do. 
Mister Motion, he hated flowers, 
He hated Peter Pan and Desperate Dan and silver summer showers 

Motion, he was a bad guy 
He went from head to head injecting lead 
With seeds of deadly nightshade. 

Do diddle do diddle do Motion. 
Do diddle do diddle do. 

Sock it to me mama.

Do diddle do diddle do Motion. 
Do diddle do diddle do.
