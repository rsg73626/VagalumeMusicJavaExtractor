THE VISIT

My eyes went up 
It was sunrise 
The sky turned black 
It was noon 

A ship of the silverest 
Metal 
Shadowed out 
All of the moon 

A shape 
That was golden and crimson 
Extend a claw 
To my frame 

I sunk in the sand 
Like an infant 
I screamed 
But my tongue was lame 

My heart on a platter 
They'd stolen 
My eyes 
Were all fiery flame 

A sound like sweet dove 
I did stutter 
And then the ship
