MIDNIGHT

Baby, I need you 
Oh yeah, I need you 
Why don't you love me 
Like you yu-yu-yu-yu-used to 
I'll dance at midnight 
I'll dance at midnight 
While you're so 
Up t-t-t-t-tight 

Baby, I miss you 
Oh yeah, I'll kis you 
Why don't you love me 
Like you yu-yu-yu-yu-used to 

I'll dance at midnight 
I'll dance at midnight 
I'll dance at midnight 
I'll dance at midnight 
.... 
Last chance till midnight 

I'll dance at midnight 
Last chance till midnight 

I'll dance at midnight
