I REALLY LOVE YOU BABE

(I really love you babe) 
(I really love you babe) 
I jumped in the car gonna carry you to the stars 
So lets go see the ship 
And your hip, bronzed lipped 
I really love you babe 

Oh flat black, pink, grey 
Heart stop, heart drop 
Nothing couldn't stop it 
It's the magic in the valley 
Of the frozen rain 

Oh, oh (I really love you babe) 

Oh frost bound poetry 
Gleaming like a satellite 
Green glade diamond bright 
Now's the time to live 
Come live with me Ooh** 

Spiked heart, lost love 
Treat you girl, love you then 
Time's gone, word's wrong 
Until my angel comes 
Umm, yes 

Ooh ooh ooh (I really love you babe) 
I really love you babe 

*Repeat 

Just really love you babe 

**Repeat 

Ooh ooh ooh (I really love you babe)
