SPACE BOSS

Space Boss 
Space Boss 

Wrapped and packed and pressed to go out 
Rock and Roll is welcome where I'm at 

Are you the space boss 
Will you see me at any cost 
Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
The space boss 

Ready the flight thrust 
Did you crunch your aircraft 
Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
The space boss 

The identical twin 
And her diluted, fluted grin 
Ooh 

Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
The space boss 
The space boss, say it again 

I said, are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
Are you are you are you are you 
Are you now 
The space boss 
The space boss 
Can you dig it? 
Now you've lighted my innermost eye 
It's Rock and Roll stuff 

Your the Space Boss 
It ain't nothin', no it wouldn't be lost 
If I could mould my hands with the 
Space Boss 
Like a S-P-A-C-E
