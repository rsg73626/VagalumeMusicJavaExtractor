WIND CHEETAH

Her with moon trodden plow 
Herds of African cows 
Grazed on her beauty 
Fragrant and pale 

Young once youthful still now 
Muse to the willow and ploughed 
Fields arched with orchards 
Blooms of the stars 

Day whipped his black dray 
Opaque orphan of Ring Myrrh coated rider 
Guider husband to Matron the King 
Streams of yellowy mud 

Run to the one that I love 
Chained to the chalky
