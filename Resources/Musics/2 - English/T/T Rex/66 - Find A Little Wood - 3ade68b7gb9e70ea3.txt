FIND A LITTLE WOOD

Find a little wood
And have a little sleep, sleep there
Find a little wood
And have a little sleep, sleep there
Find a little wood
And have a little sleep, sleep there
Like the sun and the sea
You'll soon wash away all cares
Find a little stream
And have a little dream, dream there
Find a little stream
And have a little dream, dream there
Find a little stream
And have a little dream, dream there
Like the windy moon
You'll soon shed all your cares
Oh love is like a beautiful girl who smiles for you
Find a little wood
And have a little sleep, sleep there
Find a little wood
And have a little sleep, sleep there
Find a little wood
And have a little sleep, sleep there
Like the windy moon
You'll soon shed all your cares
Oh love is like a beautiful girl who smiles for you
