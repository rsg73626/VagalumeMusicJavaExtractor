GIRL IN THE THUNDERBOLT SUIT

Saturday drives and daring dudes 
Well who decides their moods 
Who is the center star 
The dude who takes their food 
The town is tremblin' 
The glitter maniacs pass 
Well I can't sit still 
So baby lets dance 
With the girl in the thunderbolt suit 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 

She's cute, that girl 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 
She's cute 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 

We just love restrictively 
My old and lovely head 
I love you most of all In the meshes in my head 
You do me like you do 
The wind blows only chance 
But I can't sit still 

So baby let's dance 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit 
Girl in the thunderbolt suit
