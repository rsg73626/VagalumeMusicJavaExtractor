THE TIME OF LOVE IS NOW

Light up your face 
With all the love within you 
Say your word 
Make it heard 

Light up the wind 
With all the kings inside you 
Shout it out 
Have no doubts 
For the time of love is now 

Light up your head 
With things the children said child 
Make a start 
From your heart 

Light up the world 
With poems from within you 
Shout it out 
Have no doubts 
For the time of love is now 

And your days of love 
Are always in a dream 
You know.
