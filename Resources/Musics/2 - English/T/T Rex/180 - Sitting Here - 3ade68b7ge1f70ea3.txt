SITTING HERE

Sitting here, I don't care for you
Sitting there, you don't care for me
But I think we're in love
Ain't that funny
Sitting there, you don't care for me
Sitting here, I don't care for you
But I think we're in love
Ain't that funny
Oh love's a wonderful thing that comes and goes
Even when I'm pickin' my nose
Ooh sitting here, you don't care for me
Sitting here, I don't care for you
But I think we're in love
Ain't that funny
Yeah yeah
Sitting here, I don't care for you
Sitting here, I don't care for you
And I think we're in love
