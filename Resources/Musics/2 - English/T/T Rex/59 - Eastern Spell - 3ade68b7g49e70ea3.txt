EASTERN SPELL

Eastern voices calling to you 
Mystic magic oceans of blue 
Timeless wonders cease to wonder 
When you know the spell you're under Is mine. 

Many times I've seen the sunset 
Only 'cos I'm trying to get 
All the love my mind is holding 
Unseen pleasures are exploding for me. 

Secret sounds of giant sea birds 
Singing songs of lonesome sailors 
Golden cats in temples only knowing
