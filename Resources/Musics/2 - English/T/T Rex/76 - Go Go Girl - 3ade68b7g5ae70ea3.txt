GO GO GIRL

Mama-ma-mama, mama-ma-mama, mama-m-mama 
Mama-ma-mama, mama-ma-mama, mama-m-mama 
Mama my go go girl 
She's all put together with chocolate feathers 
And my baby don't know just what to do 
My baby says, "Hey, keep cool, you!" 
She don't realize, I'm hypnotized 
she's all put together and she gives me lots of pleasure, and
Mama-ma-mama, mama-ma-mama, mama-m-mama 
Mama-ma-mama, mama-ma-mama, mama-m-mama 
Mama, my go go girl 
she's all put together with chocolate feathers 
Yeah 

My baby don't know where I'm hidin' 
My baby keeps askin' where I've bin 
My baby is guessin' that I'm messin' 
She's all put together with chocolate feathers and 
My go go girl 
My my go go girl 
My my go go girl 
My my g-g-g-g-go go girl 
My my g-g-g-g-go go girl 

[Fade...]
