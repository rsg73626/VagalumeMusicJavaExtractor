THE SEA BEASTS

The sea beasts scull the waters 
Feeling fear for thee 
The hawks that tamed the skies 
Wish you so well to be. 

A Foal in the fields 
With the bless of the hills your 
Shore and you're poor and your sore feetys 
Ne'er to be bore 
By man's claw. 

The horned dog guarding grandly 
Daughters of the Sun 
At night in twilight groves 
His pray for you is begun. 

You foal in the fields 
With the bless of the hills on your 
Shore and you're poor and your sore feetys 
Ne'er to be bore By man's claw. 

The bull of gold that's old 
Beyond the songs of man 
Keeps watch upon the fates 
When they misweave your strand. 

O Foal in the fields 
With the bless of the hills on your 
Shore and you're poor and your sore feetys 
Ne'er to be bore 
By man's claw. 

UFO, UFO you are UFO, 
UFO you are UFO,
