DRAGON'S EAR

Dragon's ear and druid's spear 
Protects you while the *Dworns are here 
The winds of wrath chill cold the cloth 
That drapes her shape from fangs of fear 

I love you my love 
Please taketh this heart which I bear 
O heal my sorrow 
Weareth my arms like a charm 
Through the dales of your doom 

Our lives are merely trees of possibilities. 

(*Dworn-Machinery of war, a bronze frame with wheels of white ivory and the horns of a gazelle for steering, so sayeth Agadinmar.)
