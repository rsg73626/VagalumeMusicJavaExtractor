TOKEN OF MY LOVE

With your stained glass look 
Ahh........ 

Well do you remember when we met 
You stuck behind me like a stained glass net 
And I'm broken 
Is that a token of your love 
Is that a token 
A token of your love 

Do you remember when we met 
You moved behind me like a stained glass net 
And I'm broken 
Is that a token of your love 
Is that a token 
A token of your love 

Everyday, every single day 
My heart is broken, 
Oh yeah 
Everyday, every single day 
Does this mean my love has been awoken ** 

*Repeat **Repeat *Repeat 

Is that a token
