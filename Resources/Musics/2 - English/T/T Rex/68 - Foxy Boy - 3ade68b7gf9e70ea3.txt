FOXY BOY

Girl won't you move close to me
Take me in your arms and groove me 
Girl don't you ever miss a date 
With your Foxy Boy 
Girl won't you move close to me
Take me in your arms and groove me 
Girl don't you ever miss a date 
With your Foxy Boy 

The nights are long 
And my love grows strong 
As I work all day 
I dream a song 

With words of love 
You captured my soul 
As we reached to hold 
My heart you stole 

Girl won't you move close to me
Take me in your arms and groove me 
Girl don't you ever miss a date 
With your Foxy Boy 

Girl won't you move close to me
Take me in your arms and groove me 
Girl don't you ever miss a date 
With your Foxy Boy 

With each dawn men are history born 
A summer romance, a winter storm 
My disco love that was destined to be 
You kissed me hard, my soulless sea 

Girl won't you move close to me
Take me in your arms and groove me 
Girl don't you ever miss a date 
With your Foxy Boy 

Girl won't you move close to me
Take me in your arms and groove me 
Girl don't you ever miss a date 
With your Foxy Boy
