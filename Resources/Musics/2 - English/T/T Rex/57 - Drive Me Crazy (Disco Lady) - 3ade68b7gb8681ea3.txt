DRIVE ME CRAZY (DISCO LADY)

Do the Bomp, let's stomp 
I'm a Disco Lady, who's gonna play me? 
I'd just like to tell ya 
I hope you'll get some pleasure 
I'll dance past midnight 
So don't get uptight 
If I bump real dirty 
We're gonna party 
'Til one-thirty 
I'm a Disco Lady 
I'm a Disco Lady 
I'll drive you crazy 
I'm a foxy baby 
Get down, get down 

I'll try to do the hoe-down 
I can jive now, I can get it on 
Even do the locomotion 
I'll even swim in the ocean 
I'm a Disco Lady 
Who's gonna play me 
I just like excitement 
I hope you get a partner 

I'm a Disco Lady 
I'm a Disco Lady 
I'll drive you crazy 
I'm a foxy baby 
Get down, get down 

Do the Bomp, let's stomp 
Disco baby 
Disco Lady 
She'll drive you crazy 
She's a foxy baby 
Get down, get down 

Do the Bomp, let's stomp 
I'm a Disco Lady, who's gonna play me? 
I'd just like to tell ya 
I hope you'll get some pleasure 
I'll dance past midnight 
So don't get uptight 
If I bump real dirty 
We're gonna party 
'Til one-thirty 

I'm a Disco Lady 
I'm a Disco Lady 
I'll drive you crazy 
I'm a foxy baby 
Get down, get down 

Do the Bomp, let's stomp...
