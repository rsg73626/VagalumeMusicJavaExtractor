WRITE ME A SONG (SUPERTUFF)

Write me a song
That the world can sing along
And I'll sing you a song
That stands for living

Write me a song
That the world can sing along
And I'll sing you a song
From the heart

Alright Alright
You look supertough to me
Alright Alright
You look supertough to me 

Write me a song 
That the world can sing along 
And I'll sing you a song
That stands for living
