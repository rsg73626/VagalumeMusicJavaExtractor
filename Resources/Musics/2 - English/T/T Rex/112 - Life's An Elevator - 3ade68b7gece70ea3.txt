LIFE'S AN ELEVATOR

Sat with a cat on your head
Alone at last
You cry with a sigh
Resurrecting all your past
Life's an elevator
It goes up and down
Life's an elevator
Can't you dig the sound
Scenes from your past
Spread before the flaming dawn
Have faith in the hearts
Of the world they're rocking on
Swift is the kill
Shadows fill the empty walls
Wild is the word
