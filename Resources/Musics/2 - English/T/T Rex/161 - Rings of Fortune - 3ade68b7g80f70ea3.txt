RINGS OF FORTUNE

Rings of  Fortune in my way 
I've motorcycled the King's Highway 
I sailed on a ship on the Spanish galleon 
I'm the Angel of the Black Medallion 
Peter Pan I am, I say 
I harvested the sunlight through my day 
Vagabond of the Eastern Moon 
Give my love with every single spoon 

Hung at dawn 'cos it's sun by noon 
Charlie's black cat with a bad time tune 

Sad to see things that were kind 
I'm no Has-been's clever child 
Well of wishing, want you more 
Than golden rings upon my door 

Saw the people laughing 
Saw the people cry 
Saw the people kneeling 
Saw the people die
