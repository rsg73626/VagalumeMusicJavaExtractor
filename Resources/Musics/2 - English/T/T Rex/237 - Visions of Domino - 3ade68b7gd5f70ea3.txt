VISIONS OF DOMINO

Her love is hot, but mine is not 

This woman is a perfumed breeze 
Greek Gods recline on her knees 
I'd freeze the sun to kiss her ear 

It all makes up the visions I call Domino 
It all makes up the visions I call Domino 
Right now 

A suit of doubt she gave to me 
In return I cried a sea 
Of poet's tears and something more 
I camped outside her velvet doors 

Love's a freak and it moves fast 
My marble dream it could not last 
Now every time this girl I see
