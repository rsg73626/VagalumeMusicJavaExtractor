'PON A HILL

'Pon a hill a green bird sat 
Her owlets in a green felt hat 
Her fortune was a wish. 

Ambassador a heron blue 
Rode on the dawn with kegs of dew 
He said his tales were true 

A ragged youth with eyes of glass 
Was seen dancing upon the grass 
His words were winged and wise 

His shaven skull he etched with ease 
The silent scriptures of the trees
