INTERSTELLAR SOUL

Running around in the dawn with that hat 
I can see, I am no match for you 
Doing the foxtrot on your knees-Garbo Girl, 
It's so hard to contemplate you 
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul 
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul 

That rich ditch won't catch me girl but it sculpted you 
Silk and Diamond gilded gauntlet can be weird 
But I'm scared to look like you 
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul 
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul 

Lean on my head kiss my knee, breathe again 
Bumble bee in my ear see a tear but it's solid and gold 
I don't want to get like you 
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul 
'Cos you're so full of interstellar soul
