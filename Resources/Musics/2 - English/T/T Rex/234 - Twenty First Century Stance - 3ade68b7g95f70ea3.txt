TWENTY FIRST CENTURY STANCE

Beep, beep, beep, beep, da da da da 
etc. 

I know what I want 
I know what I'm gonna say 

Swish little chick 
with your 21st century stance 
Moving like a horse 
With a 50-1 shot chance 
As I catch your eye 
I'm reflected in your glance 

Smash, bash, crash... 
That's what my heart says 
Smash, bash, crash... 
That's what my heart says 
Smash, bash, crash... 
That's what my heart says 
Smash, bash, crash... 
And I know what I want, and I know what I'm gonna say 

Beep, beep, beep, beep, da da da da 
Beep, beep, beep, beep, da da da da
