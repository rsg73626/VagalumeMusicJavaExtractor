SUNKEN RAGS

It's a shame it's sunken rags
The way you play me down
It's a shame the way you hide me in the electric school
I was brave to call your name
Down in the alleyway
It's a shame the way you treat me like a fool
So ride on, fight on
Love is gonna win
It's gonna beat your sins
Fight on, ride on
Love is gonna win
It's gonna beat your sins
It's a game with broken brain
The way you smile on me
I'm a bird that rides upon your window fools
It's a shame how you unzip my winter poetry
It's a shame the way you treat me like a fool
