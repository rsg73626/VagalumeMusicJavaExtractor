THINK ZINC

People passing by, all through the night 
They use my senses in strange ways 
She knows just what you are, like a fading star 
And she uses my senses in strange ways * 

You've got to think zinc 
Think a, think a 
Think a, think a 
Think a, think a 
Ooh ** 

You've got to think zinc 
Think a, think zinc 
Think a, think zinc 
Zinc, zinc 
Ooh ** 

People passing by, all through the night 
They use my numbers in strange ways 
Over the telephone, you should hear them groan 
I crossed his wires in strange ways * 

**Repeat ***Repeat 

All my favourite people child, you gotta think zinc 
All my favourite people child, you gotta think zinc 

*Repeat **Repeat 

***Repeat three times 

Oh hmm hmm 

*Repeat **Repeat ***Repeat 

Think zinc, think zinc baby
