FUTURISTIC DRAGON

Deep beneath an ancient shadow 
Stunned with age and too much wisdom 
Reclined in glass, with eyes too steep 
Relentless dimensions of quadraphonic sleep 
Dwelt the wild grinning Cyclopean pagan 
Screaming destruction in sheer dazzling raiment 
A thunderbolt master a 'lectronic savior 
A gold galactic raver, the Futuristic Dragon
