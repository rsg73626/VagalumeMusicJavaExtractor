DEBORA

Dug a re dug n dug a re dug etc.
Oh Debora, always look like a zebra
Your sunken face is like a galleon
Clawed with mysteries of the Spanish Main, oh Debora...

Dug a re dug etc.
(Ex tempore)
Debora

Oh Debora, always dress like a conjuror
It's fine to see your young face hiding
'Neath the stallion that I'm riding, Debora...

(Ex tempore)
Dug a re dug etc.
(Ex tempore)
Debora

Dug a re dug n dug a re dug etc.
Oh Debora, you look like a stallion
Oh Debora, you look like a stallion
Your sunken face is like a galleon
Clawed with mysteries of the Spanish Main
