BELTANE WALK

Trucking down by the roadside 
Met a man with a starhide 
He said boy wouldn't you like to look 
But could it give me love 
Give me little love from her heart 

Bopping down by the whirlpool 
I met a girl she was god's tool 
I said girl wouldn't you like to rock 
But could it give me love 
Give me little love from god's heart 

Walking down by the westwind 
I met a boy he was my friend 
I said boy we could sing it too 
And we do 
Give us love 
Give us little love 
Give us little love from your hearts 

And then we'll walk.
