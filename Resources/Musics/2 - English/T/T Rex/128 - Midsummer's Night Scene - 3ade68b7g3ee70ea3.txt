MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT SCENE

Petals and flowers
Petals and flowers
Petals and flowers
In the park getting dark eating the heat
there's an eye in the sky melting your feet
you see a chick who starts to nick the petals and flowers
She starts to joke and then provoke the dance of the hours
It's all down to a midsummer's night scene
It's all down to a Shakespearean dream
Get her face there's a place disfigured with love
Her hands are white like the night encased in a glove
She starts to swing and watches you nick petals and flowers
She starts to joke and then evokes the dance of the hours
Its all down to a midsummer's night scene
Its all down to a Shakespearean dream
Its all down to a midsummer's night scene
