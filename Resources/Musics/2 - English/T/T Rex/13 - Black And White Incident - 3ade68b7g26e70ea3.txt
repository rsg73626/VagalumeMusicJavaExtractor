BLACK AND WHITE INCIDENT

I don't want a black and white Cadillac car 
I don't want a black and white Jaguar 
I don't want a black and white blue-jean scene 
I just want for you to turn turn me on 
To your fine, fine, superfine 
Everywhere you're goin' around 
My my my my my my my my... 
I'm in love with you 

I don't want a black and white Chevrolet 
I don't want a black and white Lincoln A 
I don't want a big fine woman everyday 

I just want for you to turn turn me on 
To your fine, fine, superfine 
Everywhere you're goin' around 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my.... 
I'm in love with you 

I don't want a black and white Chevrolet 
I don't want a black and white Lincoln A 
I don't want a big fine woman everyday 

I just want for you to turn turn me on 
To your fine, fine, superfine 
Everywhere you're goin' around 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my....
