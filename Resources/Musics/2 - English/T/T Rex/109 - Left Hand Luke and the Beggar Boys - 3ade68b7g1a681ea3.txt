LEFT HAND LUKE AND THE BEGGAR BOYS

Call yourself friend, and look me in the eye, 
I'll unstrap my knees an apologise, 
'Cos I'm, Left Hand Luke and the begger boys, 
O yes we are. 

Ain't no neighbours, upon our hill, 
'Crept slight thigh Be-bop and old gumbo jill, 
But I'm, Left Hand Luke and the begger boys, 
O yes we are. 

Ain't nobody's some-one, 
And it hurts deep inside, 
Just call us taxi mama and we'll take you for a ride, 
'Cos we're, Left Hand Luke and the begger boys. 
O yes we are. 

Left hand luke and the begger boys, 
O yes we are. 

Myxomatosis is an animal's disease, 
But I got so shook up mama that it ate away my knees, 
And I'm Left Hand Luke and the begger boys, 
O yes we are. 

Ain't had no money lord, but it's plain to see, 
If you had some silver mister how much would you pay for me? 
'Cos I'm, Left Hand Luke and the begger boys, 
O yes we are.
