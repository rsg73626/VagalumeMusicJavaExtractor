WIND QUARTETS

The wind quartet howls softly 
My jeep hand strokes her necklace 
Crusted, crammed with old Etruscan gold. 

Her bird head torn with summer 
Inspects a Spartan runner 
Robbing time a chosen Prince of Speed 

My goblet drenched with Autumn 
Tears for my dead cat Ena 
Silver Surfer sorcerer of spray. 

She headed deep in chartreuse 
A falcon glimpse of white teeth 
Separated by lace cinnamon folds. 

We hid and rid in hansom 
Cab wrenched from lost Byzantium
