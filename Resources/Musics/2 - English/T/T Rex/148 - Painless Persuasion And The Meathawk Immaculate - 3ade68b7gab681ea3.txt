PAINLESS PERSUASION AND THE MEATHAWK IMMACULATE

It's gonna go, it's gonna go 
It's gonna go, it's gonna go 

I can see wild flame in front of me 
I can see streets built on ebony 
I can see men as big as cedar trees 
What's goin' on 

I can feel earthquakes inside of me 
I can sense landslides of devilry 
I can be everything that's been bad to me 
What's goin' on 

I say look to your soul, you better look to your soul 
You better look to your soul, you better look to your soul 

Or else it's gonna go It's gonna go (Repeat Verses 1 & 2)
