CADILLAC

Yeah
Baby I wanna walk you home
Oh baby I wanna walk you home
There's a shadow in the bedroom
And I'm scared to sleep alone
Baby doesn't everybody weep
Oh baby doesn't everybody weep
I'd slide up there beside you
But my nightmare's oh too steep
Yeah
Baby I wanna buy you a Cadillac
Baby I wanna buy you a Cadillac
I bought it with my song
But you say that you're gonna give it back
Yeah
Baby I love you baby
