RIDE MY WHEELS

Oh baby won't you ride them 

I'm just a boy, be my toy 
Ride my wheels 
I'm just a boy, be my toy 
Ride my wheels 

I've got some punk 
To lay on you 
Just be real girl 
I never asked you to be true 

Slim is the wind 
And my head is slight 
But lady I want to 
Oil your engines all night 

Drive me baby 
I give service
