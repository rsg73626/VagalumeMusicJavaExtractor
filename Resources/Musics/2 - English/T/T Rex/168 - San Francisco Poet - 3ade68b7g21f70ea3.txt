SAN FRANCISCO POET

His schooling days were ruling days to show it 
To all the people eagerly wanting to blow it 
Crazy just to see how foolish I can be 
If he happens to be a San Francisco poet 
Hey there Frisco poetically speaking 
The days of the beatnicks are gone 
Hey there Frisco poetically speaking 
The Bible's all written wrong. 

His schooling days were ruling days to show it 
To all the people eagerly wanting to blow it 
Crazy just to see how foolish I can be
