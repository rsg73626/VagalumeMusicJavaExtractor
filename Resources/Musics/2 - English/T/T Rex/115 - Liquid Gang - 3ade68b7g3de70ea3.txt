LIQUID GANG

It's gonna be grand when you take 
the hand of the liquid gang, oh yeah 
Peter with the heater, he's such a messy eater 
He's got frogs in his eyes from telling those lies 
Sunday's almost Monday and you gotta understand 
It's gonna be grand when you take 
the hand of the liquid gang, oh yeah 

Shelly 's silver belly, she's got me on the telly 
Down with the dog he's a rockabilly yob 
The kids are young, but that's how we begun 
You gotta understand when you take 
the hand of the liquid gang, oh yeah 

You're gonna be grand (x4) 

Paladin heat with the dancing feet 
Rides a two tone bike he does what he likes 
But my head is alright but you're out of sight 
But you gotta understand when you take 
the hand of the liquid gang, oh yeah 

You're gonna be grand (Repeat to end)
