BY THE LIGHT OF A MAGICAL MOON

I'm gonna dance with my princess 
By the light of a magical moon 
As I go along my way 
I say hey-hey 

I'm gonna talk with the elders 
And tell all of our hearts 
That is good I'll barefoot dance with my baby 
By the light of a magical moon 

When I slay the darkest day 
Then we can play 
'Till that deep and joyous day
