FIST HEART MIGHTY DAWN DART

Fist Heart Mighty Dawn Dart 
In some way our slain our yours 
Stone eyes drill for wealth lies 
In some way our fate is one. 

Funny how the day comes slow 
Funny how the day comes so. 

Fist Heart Mighty Dawn Dart 
At a glance our dance is one 
Sun liege by your star trees
