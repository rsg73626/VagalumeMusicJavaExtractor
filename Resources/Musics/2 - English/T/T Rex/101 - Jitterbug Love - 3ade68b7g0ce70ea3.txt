JITTERBUG LOVE

We've got to get together
We've got to get together
Oh yes we have
Oh yes we have
Because jitterbug love
Is going all around
Jitterbug love is going all around now
Here it comes again
We'll rock and roll together
We'll even stroll together
Oh yes we will
Oh yes we will
One, Two, Three
