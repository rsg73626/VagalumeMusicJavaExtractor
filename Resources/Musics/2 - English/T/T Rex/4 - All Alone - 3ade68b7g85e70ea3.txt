ALL ALONE

All alone I sit at home 
With my chrome guitar 
Even Michael Mouse 
He has a house with someone there 
You handsome bitch, you movie twitch 
And seranade the dudes that move and 
Smile so vile and masquerade, they masquerade 

An adjacent kid with a Jamacian lid 
And switch-blade knife, steals the 
Truth from your golden tooth then he 
Turns you in 

So you hold hands tight on a marble night 
And maybe dismissed, but know that 
Zeus is never loose with his Grecian kiss 
His Grecian kiss 

Fiery skies in children eyes 
Fade into youth bleeding blood and tears 
On all the ears, that heard your gold 
So you walk the dog and you stroll the fog 

On a dome sky earth, and lie too hard 
Is an English bard, you better hide your tracks 
Better watch your mind
