GREAT HORSE

Great Horsey Champer Gold
villas 
With the Sun 
Dipped diving with his horned onyx saddle 
Shining in the black aped eyeballs 
Of the gun 

When the great apple falls 
She'll be queen of your halls 

Tall bowman from the burnt pastures 
Saw Champer and he bowed ground kissing 
To his lord 

Strange beastie from the legend lair Sire, 
I can master with the aid of this
