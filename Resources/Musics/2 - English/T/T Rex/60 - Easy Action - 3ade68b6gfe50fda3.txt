EASY ACTION

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Life is the same and it always will be, hey hey hey
Easy as picking foxes from a tree, hey hey hey
But I can't get no satisfaction, all I want is easy action

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
A stud is a lamb with the thoughts of a tiger, hey hey hey
Moves like a cat and knows how to ride her, hey hey hey
But I can't get no satisfaction, all I want is easy action baby

Hey hey hey, strule on!
But I can't get no satisfaction, all I want is easy action

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
A woman from the East with her headlights shining, hey hey hey
Eased my pain and stopped my crying, hey hey hey
But I can't get no satisfaction, all I want is easy action baby

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
You know my head will keep her smiling
My wondrous walk and my telephone dialing
I can't get no satisfaction, all I want is easy action baby

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude but all I want is easy action
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude but all I want is easy action
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude but all I want is easy action, baby

Hey hey hey, strule on!
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey ....
