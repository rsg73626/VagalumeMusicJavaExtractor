ISCARIOT

A box of doves 
I placed beside your chest 
Liar 
A stork of silk 
With rubies in it's nest 
Fire 
Of my love 
Will burn thee to a wizened word 
For ere to go unheard. 

A mare of wood 
Elder, elm and oak 
Liar 
Will keep you fair 
If you jest me no joke 
Fire 
Of my love 
Will burn thee to a wizened word 
For ere to go unheard. 

I'm old and bruised 
But my fate is that of youth 
Liar 
Trickster you 
Be a grisly dragon's tooth 
Fire 
Of my love 
Will burn thee to a wizened word 
For ere to go unheard. 

You gashed the heart of my heart 
Like a Portuguese 
Witch, 
I'd planned for you this land
