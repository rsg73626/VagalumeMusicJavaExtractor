PAIN AND LOVE

A punkoid opera in C flat and razor sharp 

We have traveled pain and love 
To call ourselves high born 
Living in a maze so crazed, lunacy is legend 
Lunacy is legend 

Words I fear that clutch my crutch 
And drive your senses crazy 
Men or women too get blue, 
so don't make living hazy 
No don't make living hazy 

Once in youth the wisdom crouched 
Deep inside my bedroom 
Visitations now are scarce, winter life is lonely 
Now winter life is lonely 

Temples that are bleak and bleached 
Are bleached up on the highway 
God of truth returned just once 
and made my prison homely 

Don't make my life so lonely
