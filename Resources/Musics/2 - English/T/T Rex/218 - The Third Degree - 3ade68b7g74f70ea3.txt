THE THIRD DEGREE

Everywhere I go people question me
she read my head and I can see
Philosophising mad psychiatrist
closing of my mind in darkness
Beware of the third degree
Everywhere I go people follow me
They look, they smile, they cannot see
I am too much for them to take in
they only say that I am faking
Beware of the third degree
Everywhere I go people always say
It's sad to see him act this way
Philosophising mad psychiatrist
just closing of my mind in darkness
Beware of the third degree, yeah
Sanity baby is all I got
I'm as sane as you believe it or not
Philosophising mad psychiatrist
just closing my mind in darkness
