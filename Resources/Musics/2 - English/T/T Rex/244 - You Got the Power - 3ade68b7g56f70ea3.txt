YOU GOT THE POWER

You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power, the power to mend 
My, my, my, my mind 
You got the power, the power to look and see and 
Fi-fi-fi-fi-find 
Things that've been lost in the mist of kisses 
Teddy bears with broken faces 
Legless horses with distorted bad time nightmare faces 

I wanna tell you now 

You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power, the power to mend 
My, my, my, my mind 
You got the power, the power to look and see and 
Fi-fi-fi-fi-find 

Thngs that've been lost in the mist of kisses 
Teddy bears with broken faces 
Legless horses with distorted bad time nightmare faces 

You got the power 
You got the power 
You got the power
