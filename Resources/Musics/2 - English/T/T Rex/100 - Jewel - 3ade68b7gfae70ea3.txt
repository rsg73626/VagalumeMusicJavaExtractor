JEWEL

I've got a little babe 
With jewels upon her lip 
I've got a little babe 
With jewels upon her lip 
Her hair's like a river 
It's fast and slowly drips 

She bathes in thunder 
The elves are under her 
She bathes in thunder 
The elves are under her 
She walks the wind 
And has a panther 
With silver fur 

Her thoughts are gold 
Her eyes electric blue 
Her thoughts are gold 
Her eyes electric blue 
She sleeps upon the dreams
