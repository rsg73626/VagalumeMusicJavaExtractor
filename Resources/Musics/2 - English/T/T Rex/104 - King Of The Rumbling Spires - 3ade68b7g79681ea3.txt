KING OF THE RUMBLING SPIRES

Light all the fires,
It's the King of the Rumbling Spires,
Light all the fires,
It's the King and he's coming home.
We're so windy fair
Portrait of my young soul
Mighty eagles pair On the peace of your hair.
Light all the fires,
It's the King of the Rumbling Spires
Light all the fires,
It's the King and he's coming home.
