LUNACY'S BACK

Lunacy's back (Loony) 
Lunacy's back (Loony) 
Lunacy's back (Loony) 
Lunacy's back 
Lunacy's back with his pony and trap and his big mouth 
He's asked through the years with his tears and his fears in a hen house 

Hung on a star, his cigar is suspended from his lips 
His coat is a moat and his bread is the lead that keeps him there 

Bizarre is killed in a drawer in the deep sheets of his bed 
His head is the hat reaches up from the mat made of yeti 
His drinks are all laced with the liquid dye traces of his love 

Lunacy hid in the skin of a gasoline rainbow 
Is where he was claimed as a trainee explainer of madness 
He melted a picture of sane peoples bubbles 
When that sunny-eyed lightning, explaining their troubles 
The business world's puddles reflecting their true Venusian doubles
