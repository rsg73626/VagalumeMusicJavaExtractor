THE TRAVELLING TRAGITION

Shadow cloak swift as a swallow, 
Pantaloon down in the hollow, 
Dancing, his voice like a cloud 
In the death of my night. 

Awful eyes, black Persian beggar, 
Harlequinesque, hair plaited heather, 
Stepping so lightly, 
A sprite in the house of my sight. 

0 m'dear, travelling Tragition, 
It's sky clear, you're a gift from the fair folk.
