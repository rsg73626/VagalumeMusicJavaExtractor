I'M WEIRD

Keep on sayin' I'm weird 
Keep on sayin' I'm weird 
Keep on sayin' I'm weird to see everyone as me 
And weirder to dispose of my, my, my 
Fantastic skill 
Keep on sayin' I'm in love 
Keep on sayin' I'm in love 
Keep on sayin' I'm in love to you 
Any things I do are just reflections of my obscene and distorted love 

Keep on sayin' I'm a fool 
Keep on sayin' I'm a fool 
Keep on sayin' I'm uncool 
To not understand a lot of the things you got seem not to care 

Keep on sayin' I'm a fool 
Keep on sayin' I'm a fool 
Keep on sayin' I'm uncool 
To not understand a lot of the things you got seem not to care
