GALAXY

Which Galaxy are you from 
Tell me how they bang a gong 

Your world, I mean your world 
Your world, I mean your world 

Shadow in the alley at midnight 
Metal clad rocker with bent teeth 

My world, I mean my world 
My world, I mean my world 

My planets like an angel with clipped wings 
A river bed dump shed sweetheart 

Do they have sickness in society 
Do they have glitter crap gaiety 

Your world, I mean your world
