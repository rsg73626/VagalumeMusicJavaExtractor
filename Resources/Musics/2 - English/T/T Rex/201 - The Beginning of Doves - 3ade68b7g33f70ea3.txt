THE BEGINNING OF DOVES

Egyptian song singer how it's always been 
Only crystal legends know I've lost the Kissing Ring 
The ring was golden small, unseen to those who crawl 
For lovers all walk tall, they've seen most everything 
The ring was the thing that made it all begin, doo-doo-da 
The ring was the thing that made it all begin, doo-doo-da 

The battle sins of some are acquainted 
With a son who only walks at night with shoes in pulling time 
The legend on him snag, and making it all a drag 
When the Kissing Ring is found, they'll destroy the only sound 

The ring was the thing that made it all begin, doo-doo-da
