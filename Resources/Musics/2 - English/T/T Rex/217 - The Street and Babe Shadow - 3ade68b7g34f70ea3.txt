THE STREET AND BABE SHADOW

Tiger tim, the tightrope walker, 
Tried to steal, the dragons daughter, 
Babe, I do mean, babe. 

Menace lurks in houses only, 
Where the hearts are fat and bony, 
Babe, I do mean babe. 

Golden risks and follys rainbow, 
Down the drain where all the time goes, 
Babe, I do mean babe. 

Frozen joe the ballet boxer, 
Chromed his toes to get his rocks oh 
Babe, I do mean babe. 

All the rats and all the peacocks, 
Built a ship and flew to venus, 
Babe, I do mean babe. 

Pain is meat and meat is people, 
Your head's a house, your soul the steeple, 
Babe, I do mean babe. 

Painted toes and purple earlobes, 
Life's a gas but it's such a scene though, 
Babe, I do mean babe. 

Shake 

Babe, I do mean babe, 
I could tell you something, 
I could tell you something,
