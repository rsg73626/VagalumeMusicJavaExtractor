BUICK MACKANE AND THE BABE SHADOW

You got two left feet 
You got two left feet 
You got two left feet, oh yeah 
My trunks don't go 
My trunks don't go 
A boy's got to be bold, oh yeah 

Buick MacKane 
Buik MacKane 
He's like a fox in the rain, oh yeah 

When I collect my dues 
When I collect my dues 
I'm gonna pump you a few, oh yeah 

Bump and grind 
Bump and grind 
But if it's good for my mind, oh yeah 

Future machine 
It's a future machine 
It's like a teenage queen, oh yeah 

Shadow in the night 
Shadow in the night 
Make your eyes burn bright, oh yeah 

You got two left feet 
You got two left feet
