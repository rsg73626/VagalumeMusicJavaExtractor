SENSATION BOULEVARD

In this crazy world 
Where jive's the game 
The've got lonely me 
Gold-plated on their brains 

Take me down to 
Sensation Boulevard 
Take me down to 
Sensation Boulevard 
I got to go down 

Slash cut boogie strut 
The mark of the beast 
Watch the groovies dance 
At the peacock feast 

Lady luck I want you 
Bumping by my side 
Like a silk shod connector 
On a midnight ride 

Sensation Boulevard 
(I got to go)
