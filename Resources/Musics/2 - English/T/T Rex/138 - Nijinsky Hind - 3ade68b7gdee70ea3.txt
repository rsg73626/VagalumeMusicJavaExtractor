NIJINSKY HIND

Nijinsky Hind is a wisp of our world 
Through the heart's eye. 
It's horns are white hide 
From the skin of our lord 
When his youth stood 
Wondrous and fair like a sea. 

Nijinsky Hind is a remnant of Earth 
As it once stood. 
A likeness in flesh of the magic 
Contained in a pearl's shell 
Breathing it's breath uniquely. 

Nijinsky Hind was begotten 
From man's thoughts of kindness. 
Its hoofs shod with gold 
Are the textures of Earth's distant future
