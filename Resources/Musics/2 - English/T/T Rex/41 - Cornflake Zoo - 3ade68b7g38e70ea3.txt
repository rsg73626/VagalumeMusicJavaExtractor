CORNFLAKE ZOO

Friendly people all in white 
I like their cause, I like to fight 
Goin' down to where I came in 
Sou'-westers, fishin' boats, go for a swim 
Hey pretty baby gonna swim for you 
Save you from the white man too 
Friendly people all in red 
I like their cause, I like their heads 
I'm goin' down to where I stepped out 
Gonna sing, gonna dance, gonna jump and shout 
Hey pretty baby gonna swim for you 
Save you from the red man too 

Friendly people all in pink 
I like their night, I like to drink 
Goin' down to where I stepped out 
I gonna swim, I'm gonna yell, scream and shout 
Hey pretty baby gonna swim for you 
Save you from the Cornflake Zoo
