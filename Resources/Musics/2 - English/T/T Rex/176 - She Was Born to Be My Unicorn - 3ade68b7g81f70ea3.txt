SHE WAS BORN TO BE MY UNICORN

She was born to be my Unicorn 
Robed head of ferns 
Cat child tutored by the learned. 

Darkly ghostish host 
Haggard vizier of the moats 
Seeks the sandled shores of Gods 
Baby of the moors. 

The night-mare's mauve mashed mind 
Sights the visions of the blinds 
Shoreside stream of steam 
Cooking kings in cream of scream. 

Jackdaw winter head 
Cleans his chalcedony bed 
A silken word of kind 
Was returned from Nijinsky Hind. 

Giant of Inca hill 
Loosed his boar to gorely kill 
The dancing one horned waife 
In doublet of puffin-bill. 

The beast in feast of sound 
Kittened lamb on God's ground 
Ridden by the born of horn
