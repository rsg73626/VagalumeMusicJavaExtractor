MUSTANG FORD

m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-my Mustang Ford

My Baby she know's I'm on a scene
My baby keeps asking where I've been
My baby's guessing that I'm messing
It's all put together with alligator leather.

My Baby she know's I'm no fool
My baby she says hey keep cool
My baby don't realise I'm hypnotized
It's all put together with alligator leather

m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-my Mustang Ford
