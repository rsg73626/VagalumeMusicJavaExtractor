NAMELESS WILDNESS

I wouldn't lie 

You're like a sanctuary, 
a poet's memory 
I wouldn't lie 

A universe of happiness 
beneath your be-bop dress 
I wouldn't lie 

And I love you, and I love you 
'Cos you're my nameless wildness 

You're like a precious book, 
a stolen golden look 
I wouldn't lie 

So keep your consciousness 
volcanoes in my breast 
I wouldn't lie 

And I love you, and I love you 
'cos you're my nameless wildness 

I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't lie 
'Cos I love you, and I love you 
'Cos you're my nameless wildness 

I wouldn't lie * (Repeat to end)
