ALL MY LOVE

Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Baby in the evening is a good thing 
Good, good song makes my heart sing 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
Leather stud demon at my window 
Sacrificial songs at my bedside 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 

Shadow on my pavement in the morning 
Baby, baby it's a kind of warning. 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 

Winter is a splinter from my dark days 
Baby, it's a rock scene madness 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 

Baby is a screamer and I love her 
Baby is a screamer and I love her 
Baby is a screamer and I love her 
Baby is a screamer and I love her 

(Repeat 4th verse) 

Baby is a screamer and I love her 
(Repeat to fade....)
