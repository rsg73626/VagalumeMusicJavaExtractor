ONCE UPON THE SEAS OF ABYSSINIA

Once upon the Seas of Abyssinia 
A cultured man with rings 
Within his ear-lobes 
Locked the door 
From which the sun arose 
A man at noon 
With shadows on his cheek bone 
Singed for sleep 
To use him as a pillow 
His robes of chintz were melting 
In the snows 

The stars with eyes 
Embedded in his footprints 
Wept sweet words 
From his remembered childhood 
Poets of the skies 
Look long and hard 

Once upon the Seas of Abyssinia 
A cultured man with rings 
Within his ear-lobes 
Locked the door 
From which the sun arose 

La, la, la, la, da, da, da, da, la, la, la, la....
