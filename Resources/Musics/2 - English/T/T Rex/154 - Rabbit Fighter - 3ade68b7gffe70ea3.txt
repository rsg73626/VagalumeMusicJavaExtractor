RABBIT FIGHTER

Shady politician in my bed 
Tying bolts of lightning to his head 
Call me Rabbit Fighter you know its true 
'Cos babe I'll Rabbit fight all over you 

Tramp king of the city he's my friend 
Moondog's just a prophet to the end 
Call me Rabbit Fighter you know its true 
'Cos babe I'll Rabbit fight all over you 

I saw a dude unscrewed and badly burned 
Laughing 'Cos he'd gotten what he'd earned 
Call me Rabbit Fighter you know its true 
'Cos babe I'll Rabbit fight all over you
