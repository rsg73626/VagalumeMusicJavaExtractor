LOVE DRUNK

In my room, alone at night 
How can I conceal my sorrow 
Shattered dreams in micro-heated beams means love... 
I'm a love drunk 
Frozen days, the old extended plays 
Of Elvis Presley and that funky old Hound Dog 
Faded pics and misty twisted kicks spell "love" 
I'm a love drunk 

Drunk on love, so drunk 
I'm a love drunk 

Drunk on love, so drunk 
I'm a love drunk
