HOT GEORGE

You sound a little crazy 
But it could be the heat 
I'm roasted like a chestnut 
By the fire of your feet 
Your body is a furnace 
Your love is the coal 
So won't you tame your man 
Hot George 

Now Georgie was a female 
As females go 
She moved fast like a jaguar 
Melting all like snow 
She was a foxy heater 
Rotating like the sun 
So won't you tame yor man 
Hot George 

Pavlovian he said "Lo"  [**unsure about this line] 
He was a bronzed style punk 
He drank up the rainbow 
To get his skull drunk 
He laid by the mission bell 
To keep his guns all creamed 
Why don't you understand? 
Hot George 

Why don't you understand? 
Hot George 

Why don't you understand? 
Hot George 

G-g-g-Georgie
