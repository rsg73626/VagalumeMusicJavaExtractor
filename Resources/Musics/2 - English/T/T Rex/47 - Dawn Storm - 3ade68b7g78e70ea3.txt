DAWN STORM

Dawn storm, o my dawn storm 
I realise you're blue 
Please babe, o don't squeeze babe 
All that I say must be true 

Baby I'm not crazy 
A rush ain't no crush it's a trip 
But learning on a journey 
Ain't no month on the sunset strip 

Times they are strange and I won't 
Rearrange 
No no no, not my love for you 
Times they are strange and I won't 
Rearrange
