MY LITTLE BABY

Where did you go my little baby 
Where did you go my little baby 
Where did you go my little baby 
From here, from here 

Walking down the streets like a mad hatter 
Lunacy's back but does it really matter 
Watch out my man, my lady's coming 
back to me 

If your sting was like a bee 
Would you die only for me 
If you go across the sea 
Would you come back to me 

Deception dissolves like a mind rainbow 
Sunset was dumped dark inside my bedroom 
Barracuda blue, won't you give 
my baby to me 

If you go across the sea 
Would you come back to me 
If your sting was like a bee 
Would you die only for me
