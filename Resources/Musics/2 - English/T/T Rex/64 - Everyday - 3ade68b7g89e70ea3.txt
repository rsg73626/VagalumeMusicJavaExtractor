EVERYDAY

Are you really as rich as you said, love? 
Everyday I could have given you 
Every little thing I ever had 
Every little thing you ever wanted 
But that was yesterday 

Everyday I could have loved you 
Everyday you could have been my pearl 
Every little thing you ever wanted 
But that was yesterday 

Time has a way of doin' cruel things to lovers 

Everyday I could have loved you 
Everyday you could have been my pearl 
Every little thing you ever wanted 
But that was yesterday 

Everyday I could have given you 
Every little thing I ever had 
Every little thing you ever wanted 
But that was yesterday 

Time has a way of doin' cruel things to lovers
