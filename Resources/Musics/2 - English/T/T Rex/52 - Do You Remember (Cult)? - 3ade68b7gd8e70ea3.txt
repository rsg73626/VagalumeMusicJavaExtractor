DO YOU REMEMBER (CULT)?

Her Face was like a cult to me 
Her limbs were fierce in symmetry 
It throws me into song 
The throng have done us wrong 
And away she goes, her toes leave gold 
Her horn of youth has passed behold 
It throws me into song 
The throng have done us wrong 

Do-oo you remember? 
Do-oo you remember? 
Pleasures of love 
Tresures of love 

The voice of light denounce the night 
Sweet pilgrims climb the chily heights 
It throws me into song 
The throng have done us wrong 

Do-oo you remember? 
Do-oo you remember? 
Pleasures of love 
Treasures of love 

Do-oo you remember? 
Do-oo you remember? 
Pleasures of love 
Treasures of love
