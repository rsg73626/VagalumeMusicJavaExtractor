ELEMENTAL CHILD

Torch girl of the marshes 
Her kiss is a whip of the moon 
Dawn's damsels are dancing 
To the hum of her sunny young tune 

Gems hemmed in the heart's head 
The shield of the rivers is hers 
She one told me to think white 
And the night disappeared like a bird 

Hold the glove of gold behind you
