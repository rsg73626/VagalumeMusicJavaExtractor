SALLY WAS AN ANGEL

Sally was an angel 
But angel's are a fake 
Could she just be a yesterday's scene 
Trying to make a break 

But I'm so lonely, mama 
But I'm so lonely 
This fallen woman, 
In my mind, the death of me 

Sally was a girl child 
When I first knifed her heart 
Now she's dead, but whose this head 
Speaking of things apart 

But I'm so lonely, mama 
But I'm so lonely 
This fallen woman 
In my mind, the death of me 

Sally was a girl child 
When I first knifed her heart 
Now she's dead, but whose this head 
Speaking of things apart 

Well I'm so lonely, mama 
Well I'm so lonely 
This fallen woman 
Gonna be in my mind, the death of me 

Ahhh, Mama
