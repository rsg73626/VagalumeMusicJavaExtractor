HOLD UP (FEAT. LIL WAYNE)

Bitch i'm me, American Gangster
Weezy F Baby, born in a manger
Trouble is my friend, i aint far into danger
Clips full of wings, turn you boys into angels
Shoot you in your halo, shoot you like Halo
New Orleans A-hole, Frio, Fuego
All about my bread like bagels, they know
I'm raw like Quelos, ball like gay hoes
Weed so strong its like i twist tornados
Spit like 9's, 4-5ths and 380's
Niggas want problems, well i am problematic
It's back to pickin cotton cause you niggas cotton candy
I'm a eastside Damu, deep water Shamoo
Shoot you from your head to your shoulders, shampoo
Kush and the bamboo, pussy in the bedroom
Pass that bitch down like an heirloom
Tunechi!

We hustle til nightfall, party til sunlight
Guns in the boxers, don't make this a gunfight
Fuck them other niggas, i'm fuckin niggas' bitches
Benadryl shit, trigger finger itchin
And we hustle til nightfall, party til sunlight
Guns in the boxers, don't make this a gunfight
Fuck them other niggas, i'm fuckin niggas' bitches

Real nigga talk, gangsta conversation
I'm a real nigga, don't fuck with imitations
Young Money nigga, aint no limitations
I dont play games, nigga simulation
Which one of y'all niggas say you bout it
This a fucked up world, T-Streets take you out it
That's word to the glock, Glock in the sock
Loose lips sink ships better stop at the dot
Hold up!

Uh, Married to the money, you welcome to the reception
And she came with problems, fuck it thats my stepsons
Sleepin in the Maybach, wake me when the jet come
And i keep the toast, turn your ass to bread crumbs
Uh, based on a true story, i got a million flows, aint even two stories
Sleepin on the edge, i hope i dont toss and turn
Shoot down the early bird and thats how i get the worm, yeah
R-Real nigga university, Alumni
Just check my watch and that bitch says 'Sometimes'
She say when i'm in her, it feel like i'm soul searchin'
And they say money talks, well its my spokesperson
Uh, grab a star from the sun roof, i fuck her in her dreams, and make her come true
Yeah, Young Money and the power, send my B's at you like motherfuckin flower
