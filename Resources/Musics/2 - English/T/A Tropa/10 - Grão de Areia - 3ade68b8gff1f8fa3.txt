Where is my daughters, I said where is my daughters? 
I be longing for my daugthers as we´re crossing over borders
Where is my daughters?

When did we become such a burden?
That you seem to think you have to carry?
You should have let us stand on our own feet
Then we would´t be so heavy to carry

Who the hell decided?

But i think you should know
