HOPE AND LIME

She said with wandering eyesproceed with failing in sights
Don't cover up my arms
With your bloody insides
And in the hall where i first fell
Im hardly nearly able
And if you're not comfortable
Than why the hell are you still here
Falling face down to the curb
Sorry if every word is slurred
Almost half a breath i have
To tell you how i feel
When it comes in time
These lines will all be spelled out
And with this hope and lime
Im sure you'll figure it out
And in the hall where i first fell
Im hardly nearly able
And if you're not comfortable
Then why the hell are you still here
Falling face down to the curb
Sorry if every word is slurred
Almost half a breath i have
To tell you how i feel
