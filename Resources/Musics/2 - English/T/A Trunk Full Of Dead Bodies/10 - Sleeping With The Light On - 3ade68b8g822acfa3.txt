SLEEPING WITH THE LIGHT ON

We've talked our tongues off
And watched our gums swell
In the light of making sense
I stumbled in
And you've described it as
Moving faster than
You and me the first time we met
How did we get all undressed
So wake up smiley face
There's one more thing i hate it's you (x2)
More tired than my eyes
And the bed we lied in
That night, remember, you stole the covers
And this room entirely too small to breathe
When the temperature is 90 and you're at 8, but it's too late
So wake up smiley face
If there's one more thing i hate
It's you (x2)
