THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR

My face as
Red as the blade
Looking in your eyes
I see you feel the same
But as i remember
Around this time last summer
Your hands to your side
Held by the knot i tied
And it takes more
Convincing to get
Yourself out of this
You've sunk this far in it
Don't think that you recall that sleepless slumber at all
Ho can you breathe
When your face's buried beneath the sheets
Im way to drunk to talk to you
How did i ever fall for you
This one night stand is killing me
I hope its killing you
You said we can't be friends
I said i could never be
And i don't date sympathy
Anymore, any way but what's the point of living without you
