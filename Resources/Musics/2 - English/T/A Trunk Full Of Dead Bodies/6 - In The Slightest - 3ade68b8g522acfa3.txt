IN THE SLIGHTEST

In the worst wayi'd love to see how you'd react
The look on your face
Don't be shy because angels stab in sequence
Don't let my
Legs grow tired
From walking in circles
That you left here
Don't invite me in
Your silly words i don't comprehend
Don't invite me in
Your silly games i don't understand (x2)
All i have
Is this corpse and the box is leaking
All i want
Is your death but you just keep breathing
