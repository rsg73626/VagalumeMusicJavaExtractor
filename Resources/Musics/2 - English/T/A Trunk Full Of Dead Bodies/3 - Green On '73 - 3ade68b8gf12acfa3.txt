GREEN ON '73

Rope burns on my neck are deeper in my wrists
As you hang above the light switch on my wall
To me the only things that remain are memories of the greenest eyes i've seen
And last december my sweet
Summer never seemed this cold to me
Consider this my apology
It's like pulling teeth with you constantly
Regret what i said
Regret what i did
I'm just trying to clean the mess that i made by letting you move away
Florida consumes you
Don't bleed on me because i'd never bleed on you
Just die here in my arms
