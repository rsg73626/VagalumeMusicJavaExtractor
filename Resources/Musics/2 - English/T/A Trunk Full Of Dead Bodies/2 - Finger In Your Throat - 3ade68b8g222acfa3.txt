FINGER IN YOUR THROAT

I'll simplify your character
Fill you up with gasoline to see if your flesh still burns
I watch you swing above me with a knot against your chin
Now so patiently i watch you gasp for me
There's no more air in here
With all the time you waste with how this could have been
I hold your severed hands
Your kiss tastes of everyone else
Your skind always whiter the nyour eyes it's no surprise that in the end yout thre it up
You thre it all away
The desperation in your breathing has me wondering
Is it my hands around your throat?
Sink slowly no so i can watch you cry
At the bottom of the lake you lie
