JUST ANOTHER AMBULANCE RIDE

seperate her head from torso with the 
dullest blade. ill maintain a .18 ( nine
 shots to the brain). its getting harder 
to get you off my clothes and in my car, 
but when we get there the wings cut off your
 back you wont get far. 
anticipate the fall of limbs her arm and 
both her legs. ill erase the memory of her 
kiss remains. 

I i made the rectangle for you. six feet 
and counting. her chest and neck three shades
 of blue. i provide the wine you provide the audience. 

position yourself behind my fist and prey to 
god it helps. ive grown tired of necessary steps
 and all your lines. dont keep me built up. 
dont let the likeness hurt you. because its 
garunteed that mentally your a problem with 
no solution. anticipate the fall of limbs 
her arm and both her legs. ill erase the memory of your kiss remains....
