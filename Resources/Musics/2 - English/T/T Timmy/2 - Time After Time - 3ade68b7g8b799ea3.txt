TIME AFTER TIME

Time after time
When we're together
I tell you I love you 
Now & forever
Your doing me wrong 
And there's nothing I can do
We've been through days
Where nothing would go right
In your arms your holding me so tight
Please won't you let me come into your heart
We would make love 
Through raining weather
And go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl
What your doing to me
Chorus:
Girl, why don't you just understand
Why I've got to be your man
Why don't you let yourself go
Don't you know
Time after time
My feelings get so hurt
It will take both of us
To make our love work
I'll give you love if you just give me a chance
Once in your life see that this is real
Will it be pain & sorrow that I feel
If this is love won't you see it through my eyes
Remember the days
Where we would just hold hands
Holding and kissing in the warm sand
Those were the times
When I knew you cared
Chorus (2x)
Time after time
When we're together
I tell you I love you 
Now & forever
Your doing me wrong 
And there's nothing I can do
