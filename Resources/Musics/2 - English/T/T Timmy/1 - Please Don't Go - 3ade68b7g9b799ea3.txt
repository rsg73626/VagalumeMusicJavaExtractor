PLEASE DON'T GO

Babe I love you so
I want you to know
that I gonna miss your love
the minute you walk out that door
Chorus:
Please don't go, don't go
don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
beg you to stay
If you leave
you leave my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
by someone
as wonderful as you
Chorus
Babe I love you so
I want you to know
that I gonna miss your love
the minute you walk out that door
Please don't go, don't go
don't go away, hey hey hey
I need your love
down on my knees
beg it
please, please, please don't go
I need you baby
don't leave me now
oh no, no, no, no don't go
