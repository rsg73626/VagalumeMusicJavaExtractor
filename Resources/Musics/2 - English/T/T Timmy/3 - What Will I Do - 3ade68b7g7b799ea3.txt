WHAT WILL I DO

When I met you
you meant the world to me
'cause you were the type of girl
that set her free
now I'm out cold
you stole my heart from me
but I know someday you'll think
back and remember me
Chorus:
Now what will I do
now what will I do
what will I, what will I do
without you
Now what will I do
now what will I do
what will I, what will I do
without you
Now love is gone
you're far away from me
you would have been so rich with love
but set it free
now you want home
but it's too late for me
'cause I won't be used and abused
and then set free
Chorus (3x)
