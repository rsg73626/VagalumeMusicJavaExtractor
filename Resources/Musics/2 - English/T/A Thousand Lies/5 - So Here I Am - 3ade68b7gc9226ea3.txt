SO HERE I AM

(I break my heart in a thousand pieces to say: "now you are better")

I walk miles and miles away to be there
to say now I´m so complete

Crawling to search my last piece its you
and search for the last...the last piece its you

*So here I´m to say behind my eyes, my own fall
*So here I´m far way to be close you

(AhAHhahAH)I was down without a soul
walikng for any place
before you find my love
my only hope its you

So blind to leave lies cover up to you
running against the time to recover and bleed to be close you
