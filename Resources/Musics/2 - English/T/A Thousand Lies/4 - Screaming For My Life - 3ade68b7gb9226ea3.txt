SCREAMING FOR MY LIFE

Don´t go away
Stay with me
one more day
maybe its too late

And now
I see you again
You aren´t the same
I´am not the same

In my dreams tou be there
screaming we are to escape
black and white waiting for collors
to change my words in weapons

Go away I´m better
and now I´m scremaing for my life
today I feel Alive
And now I/m screaming for my life

Thank you for nothing
to show me how you´re
now you lost in your own way
don´t come back for my life

In aututmn disaster I´m walking away
to find my summer love
now you lost in your own way
don´t come back for my life
