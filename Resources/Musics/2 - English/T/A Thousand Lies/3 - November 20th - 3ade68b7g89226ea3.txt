NOVEMBER 20TH

(NOW SET THE FIRE IN YOUR HEART, in your fucking heart)

Remember this day when the night brought you to me
hands with hands, eyes with eyes, it´s just the beging of the end
Remember that day, I feel so broken now
I´ll give up and let you go

*November 20th I need you so much to set the fire in your heart
*November 20th let me show you how much I change

Please November 20th give me one more chance
this won´t be as before
set fire in my heart when I set fire in your heart
Poison me as I poison you

Remember that day when I touch your arms
I saw a star in your eye, now you hurt me so
You can´t remeber when you said me bad words
You gime a chance, Now I´ll close my eyes

Please November 20th give me one more chance
this won´t be as before
I know my mistakes, today I can´t breath or dream
I only have you in my eyes

Please November 20th give me one more chance 
Give me one...
