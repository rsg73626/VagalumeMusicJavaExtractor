A NEW HOPE

I can´t resist this revolution inside of me
what I´ve become? Blind by lights
No time to open my eyes and trust in your hands

Your spirit drives me to be
a better person everday
without you, I´m nothing


*You are my quiet place in this crazy world
*(You Have My heart and Soul And Give Me a New Hope)

My eyes stare to find behind all lies
find all words, try to find myself
no ground to step on
and watch the move on
