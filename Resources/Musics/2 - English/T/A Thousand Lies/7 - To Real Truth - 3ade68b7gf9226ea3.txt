TO REAL TRUTH

How can I say that? The conflict this in my face  
Choked and ready for burning every fear  
all passed, I turn her paginates and my tear words of affection  
  
When you needed me, I sacrificed myself for doing to smile  
I hugged you, I loved you, I kissed their eyes for doing you to sleep  
  
To real truth it is that I carried his/her name as if it was mine  
open their eyes, because now it is too late  
  
You think about herself, it was never sacrificed  
every day that you pass dies once and I won't be oh  
this is the real true
