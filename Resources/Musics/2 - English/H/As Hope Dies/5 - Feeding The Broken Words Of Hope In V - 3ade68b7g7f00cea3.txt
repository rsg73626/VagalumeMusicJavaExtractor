FEEDING THE BROKEN WORDS OF HOPE IN V

Born into this world 
a fragile being so becomes aclloused by hardsdh reality an bleak circumstance 
for the weak will perish in this eternal fire 
only leaving hearts made of stone and hate 
betrayed by the words of false prophets 
feeding the broken words of hope in vain 
no comfort can be found in the embrace of insincerity 
we hold on by a thread of hope but that thread is nothing but a false glimmer 
we are the calloused and the broken baptized in eternal fire 
for the weak will perish in this eternal fire 
only leaving hearts made of stone and hate 
betrayed by the words of false prophets
