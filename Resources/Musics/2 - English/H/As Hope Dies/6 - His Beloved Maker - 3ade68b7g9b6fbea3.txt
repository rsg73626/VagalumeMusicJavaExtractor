HIS BELOVED MAKER

These memories they fade quick with every breath 
I realize with you gone. I can feel whole. Was forced to bow 
but my face will kiss the ground. never again 
raped of my everything. I was place in a mold. since my inception 
that I had to set a flame with a trembling hand and eyes ready to burst with tears 
I commit an act of beauty and walk away from everything 
that I had ever been taught and with putting faith in myself 
I was given a gift and a chance at life to be mine 
These memories they fade quick with every breath 
I realize with you gone. I can feel whole 
was forced to bow but my face will kiss the ground. never again 
so I now stand apart. I look into his empty eyes 
a life wasted. caught up on something. he could never even see 
he now awaits the embrace of death. waiting for his beloved maker 
an angle appears. dressed in fire and whispers it was all a lie
