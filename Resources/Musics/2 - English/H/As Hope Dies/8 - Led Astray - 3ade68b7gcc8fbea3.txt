LED ASTRAY

With the blood of millions on your hands the human race is led astray by demons 
disguised as angels. The human race suffocates with prophecy that tells of torment 
for those who do not believe in what these demons teach and yet they still believe 
and yet they still believe you are compassion. that you are the answers to their pain. 
this is not the answer to eternal life your sacrifice in vain 
For you book off life speaks of no truth it deserves fire. Ill watch it burn. 
With the blood of millions on your hands they continue to sacrifice in the name of God.

lives are based on nothing but a false existence in the human race suffocates 
with prophecy that tells of torment for those who do not believe in 
what these demons teach and yet they still believe 
when will they see that your book of life speaks of no truth. It deserves fire. ill watch it burn.
