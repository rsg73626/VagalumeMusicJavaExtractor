LEGIONS BOW TO A FACELESS GOD

Legions bow to a faceless God 
faithful to their lord 
willing to die for this savior 
they can not see. they can not feel. wasting away 
brainwashed forever. unwilling to see the lies. 
bound and gagged from day one. wings broken with no chance to fly 
I look into this empty sky with eyes of hate for you 
great deceiver. holy one. lord of deception. i denounce your name
