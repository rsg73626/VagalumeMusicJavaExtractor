DECEIVED

With A hope for purity 
you offer up your hands and bow your head to your divine one 
these actions done in vain for your faith is built on nothing 
but words that hold no weight written by men deceived just like you 
willing to sacrifice their lives and live a life according to these false writings 
I ask of you to turn against this and to declare against his following 
to renounce his throne with all your being for we will set fire to his name 
I ask this of you not for myself but in hoe that you may understand that 
religions do nothing but kill and deceive the innocent 
bow to nothing and find guidance from within for we will set fire to his name
