MY WORDS TO YOU

now show me the reason
behind your actions
that left me alone
and covered in scars
so I search for comfort
and healing to somehow
rid these demons
and set me free
I hope for a place
without suffering or tears
and I long for that day
when I can look you in the eye
and hear the echo of your voice
again in silence I lay and my thoughts
and wishes are of you but your gone
and I feel that a part of me is lost
as well so this is my comfort
and this is my release these are my words
to you one day we will burn these writings to
find comfort and erase the past and rewrite
these words and it will be
the chorus to our lives
