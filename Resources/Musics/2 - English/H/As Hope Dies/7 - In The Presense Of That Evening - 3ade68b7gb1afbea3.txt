IN THE PRESENSE OF THAT EVENING

And in the presence of that evening 
charged with meaning and with stars 
I opened for the first time to the tender indifference of the world 
as if my great anger had purged me of all evil 
emptied me of everything of hope in finding it so like me 
beyond control and ability so fraternal and in the presence of that evening 
charged with meaning and with stars I opened for the first time 
to the tender indifference of the world 
I withheld beauty so that all would be complete 
so that I could whisper a new song and fell less alone 
I gave up my insides and the only things left for me to hope 
for there will be many smiling people 
looking on the day of my execution 
and that they would welcome me with 
cries of hate as if my great anger had purged me of all evil 
emptied me of everything of hope welcome me with cries of hate
