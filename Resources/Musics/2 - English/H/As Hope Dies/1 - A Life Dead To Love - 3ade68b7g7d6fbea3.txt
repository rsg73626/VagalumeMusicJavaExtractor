A LIFE DEAD TO LOVE

All I wanted was something to hold dear 
something to hold near to my heart 
denied again I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a heart as cold as ice 
with no warmth in sight your embrace feels like a slap to my face 
so shallow and fake will this ever end. will my torment ever cease 
wishing I could feel nothing. a life dead to love 
All I wanted was something to hold dear. something to hold near to my heart 
denied again I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a heart as cold as ice 
with no warmth in sight hoping for a heart that can feel no pain 
rip this from my chest so I can never find it in myself to love and forgive you 
will my torment ever cease. wishing I could feel nothing. a life dead to love 
free from love. free from emotion. I'm free from you
