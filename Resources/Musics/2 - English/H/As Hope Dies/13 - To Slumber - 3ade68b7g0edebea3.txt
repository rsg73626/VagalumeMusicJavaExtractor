TO SLUMBER

Realized under the cover of darkness 
we are the dreams and they are the shadows 
of doubt in a lucid mind 
in a cocoon of fear 
there is nothing left 
but to tremble an submit 
while all that could of been 
lies undiscovered without meaning 
what's kept in conquers 
what's kept out and we'll be found dead 
behind locked doors with prayerless hands 
clutching useless keys 
asleep forever
