AWAKEN

Awaken from this slumber
Awaken from this dream
Remove this blindfold
Of perfect words
That have done nothing
But deceive
I hope for voices
To scream in harmony
Against the stronghold
That has taken so many
By there throats
I hope for voices
To sing in harmony
And for us to stand
With bleeding hearts
And to look away from the sky
That offers us nothing but poison
And to look at one another
And to look at one another
For this is your first glimpse
Of purity
This is reality
Do not be deceived
By the shallow beauty of words
Your God
Your writings
Your actions
Will burn to nothing
In this war
