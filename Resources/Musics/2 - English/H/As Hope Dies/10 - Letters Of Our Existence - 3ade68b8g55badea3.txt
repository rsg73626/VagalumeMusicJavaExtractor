LETTERS OF OUR EXISTENCE

Give it all every last breath
When the centuries pass
We are apparitions
Nothing but a mark in the minds
To be baptised into the earth
The destructive
All negating hands
To speak and to breath
In the context of now
To conspire
Against the ravages of time
To blossom
In the context of today
These are the letters
Of our existence
To not stumble
On the pebbles of regret
The inaudible statement ecom
Passed in a glance
And a smile it remains
To the end an experiment
In reorienmenting oneself
Within a world of total
Uncertainty give it all
Every last breath when
The centuries pass
We are apparitions
Nothing but a mark in the minds
To be baptised into the earth
The destructive
All negating hands
To speak and to breath
In the context of now
To conspire
Against the ravages of time
To blossom
In the context of now
