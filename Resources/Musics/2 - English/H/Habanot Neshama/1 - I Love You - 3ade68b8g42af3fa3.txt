I LOVE YOU

let me out let me out
relese my skin from this aching disguise
i'd like to be myself for a little while

in this hole i'm all alone
i'm waiting for you to come and take me home
into your loving arms i'll
fly.... i love you

let me out let me out
see what i'm hiding inside
my heart is yours
till the day i'll
die.....i love you
