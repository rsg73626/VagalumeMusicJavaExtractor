WHEREVER TOGETHER

Aju orae jeonbuteo seorol aratdeon geotcheoreom
machi cheoeumbuteo jeonghaejyeo itdeon geotcheoreom

You are me
I am you

We can go wherever together
We can go wherever together

Take my hand I will take you
To the end of the rainbow
Don't be scared let me hold you now
Let's fly, fly

Fly!

I know you feel the way I feel

You are me
I am you

We can go wherever together
We can go wherever together

Take my hand I will take you
To the end of the rainbow
Don't be scared let me hold you now
Let's fly, fly

Let's fly
Let's fly
Let's fly
Fly
Fly!
