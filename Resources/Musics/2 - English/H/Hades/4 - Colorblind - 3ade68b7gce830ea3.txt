COLORBLIND

What are you looking at
What is the matter
Are you that high upon the social ladder
Divide and conquer, you got it right
Just trust the differences between black and white

I wear my uniform, you wear yours too
You may not think so but you don't have a clue
The people who believe they are the rule
Are such exceptional delusional fools

[CHORUS:]</i> 
Become colorblind
Defeat, don't define

[CHORUS]

Time ? nerves inside
Concealed behind vacuous eyes
Tick, tick, ticking me off more
An emotional wreck in the guise of a bore

Wavering on the edge
One last straw shoves me off the ledge
Fall, fall, falling to my surprise
Owing this to my prejudice's demise

I was but blind before, but now I see
What is to become of you and of me
I can't do it alone, and so we flail
And wallow in this world so frazzled and frail

[CHORUS]
