DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY

You get away with murder
Self-righteous in a foriegn land
It must be quite an intense feeling
To have an entire nation in the palm of your hand
Your rights are so wrong
An insult to every citizen
We're all subject to this injustice
Your immunity must meet its end!

If you're to live here, you can't live above the law
Doesn't that make sense?!
Yet you do, what good then is democracy for
If we're not all equal?!

Yeah, I know you only work here
But I know what your job entails
Go maintain relations from your homeland
Just use a phone or try the mail!
Get out of our hair!
