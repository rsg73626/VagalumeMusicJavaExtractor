FAIL

[Music - Lorenzo]
[Lyrics - Tecchio]

Grab the good times while and when you can
They are few and far between
Simply glitches, lapses in the gloom
This I know, this I've seen

The Darkess Prevails
It wins without fail
Can't care anymore but when I am
With you it all seems fine

Grab the money, run off far away
Your problems; you'll escape
What does success mean to enslaved clones?
The world is all their's to rape
In darkness

Take these words I spill onto this page
All ideas are now on sale
You can't enjoy wealth
All alone in a cage
