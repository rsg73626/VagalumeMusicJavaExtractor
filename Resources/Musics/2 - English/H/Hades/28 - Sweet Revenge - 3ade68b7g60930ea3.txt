SWEET REVENGE

See his memory fade
Wife and daughter raped and killed one night
Life's rewards erased
Only one thing to look forward to
He wants his sweet revenge
Stalking lifeless streets
Target waiting for him underneath the light
Hands that shake with rage
Clutching ornamented bronze and steel
Nerves that twitch with fear
Like a soldier waiting for attack
His sweet revenge approaches
Springing into flight
Victims' scream are nothing that his heart can feel
His essence is freed
As the blade cuts from behind
Slicing the temple where the tender flesh
Joins one's only mind
Fighting with a desperate last breath
His life endures punishment a second time
His vision is blurred

As the life drops from his eyes
Shining the weapon as his entrails fall
Splattering upon the floor
Ripping up the pieces of nerves that keep his limbs from dying
Twitching as if still alive

Letting the body ease from his arms
Slowly slumping to the floor
Smearing all the blood along his fingertips
And watching where the deadman and his body lie
Stands atop his kill
Gloating on his recent victory
Like a lion's pride
Guarding over it triumphantly
The streets are filled with laughter
Sweet revenge is what he's after
Now he walks alone, into darkness that will only ease the pain
