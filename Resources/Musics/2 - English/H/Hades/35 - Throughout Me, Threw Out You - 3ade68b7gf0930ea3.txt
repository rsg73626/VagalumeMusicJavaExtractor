THROUGHOUT ME, THREW OUT YOU

Love you, is what I do
Need you, desire in my blood for you
At first, I had control
For my worst distinguished feeling to be bold

[CHORUS:]
Syringe pulses into my veins
Eyes roll back I'm in love again

?
I knelt, a bed has taken the cross' place
Hopeless, my guard went down
Numbness, my smile's converted to a frown

[CHORUS]
(Enticed by forbidden fire
Reasons get worn down to the wire
Until some exhibit displays
We've all come unblind to our own weakness)

If ? sees this word
Cold facts, show me that I'm absurd
Mistakes, from which I've learned
Taught me, to never let myself get burned

[CHORUS]

Love again
Never love again
