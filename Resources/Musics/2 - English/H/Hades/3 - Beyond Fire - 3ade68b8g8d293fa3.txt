BEYOND FIRE

Open mind 
Break the time 
Come closer and see 
Fire in the sky 
My beliefs 
All begins to fall 

Ready to crack 
Believe and see 
A masquerade 
Hell in sky 
Master of evil 
We're prepared to war 

Bridge: 
My misteries 
Hidden forces 
Will be enough 
You shall die 
Master of evil 
For all the land you'll pay 

My misteries 
Are your fears 
Your last act 
Of your life 
Master of evil 
My kingdom live I say 

Chorus: 
War is coming to you 
A hell into the sky 
The battle is not here 
It's Beyond Fire 

(Repeat Chorus) 

Open your eyes 
Break the time 
I can see the hill 
In front of the sky 
Master of evil 
Everything stopped 

The war will blow 
From the hill 
Cursed prophecy 
You shall die 
Master of evil 
We have a lot of hope 

(Repeat Bridge) 

(Repeat Chorus 2x) 

Hear my voice inside 
You lost this time 
See your blood on my sword 

(Repeat Chorus 2x) 

Hear my voice inside 
You lost this time 
See your blood on my sword 

(Repeat last verse) 

Hear... the... sound... of... victory... 
Your... damn... reign... now... falls... 
Our... war... Beyond... Fire... ends...
