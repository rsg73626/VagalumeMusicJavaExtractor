PROCESS OF ASSIMILATION

Process of assimilation
You're the one who used to say
"My goals will never change,
However long they take to reach!"
"I'm no feather in the wind
I'll triumph with a grin"
You spoke with such conviction
Process of assimilation
How quickly you changed your tune
When time gave you room
To grow toward your desires
You claimed "change" helped you mature
Believe me I was sure
That you were trying to convince yourself
Your problem, I thought, was a weak frame of mind
But noticing your smile, I saw the problem was mine!
We're all searching for contentment with blinders on
We've got to learn to be objective
Before life itself is gone!
