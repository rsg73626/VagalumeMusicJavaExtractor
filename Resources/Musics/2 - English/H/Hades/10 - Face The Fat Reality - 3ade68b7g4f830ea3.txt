FACE THE FAT REALITY

Your chart shows, truth you soundly deny
The stars hold, your life's blueprints
You smirk and pass them by
You just pass them by
(You're a) velvet hand inside an iron glove
Alone there, praising the very thoughts you're
Thinking of

Your veil of charm is pulled back
For all within sight
To gaze upon in surprise
I'm staring with delight!

You cannot change your fate! No!
Selfish anger on your face
Oh stop it, you're breaking my heart!
You love the fine art of disgrace
But not when it's cast in your part!
You should have listened up, and seen your faults
Narcissism gets you nowhere at all!
Nowhere at all!
