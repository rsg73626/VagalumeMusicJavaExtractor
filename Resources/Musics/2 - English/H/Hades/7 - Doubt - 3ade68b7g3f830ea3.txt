DOUBT

He only sees what he wants
It serves to fool and distract him
While slowly everything's haunted, cursed and stained

His temple that was his home
Showed itself as mere cold stone
To finally feel all alone is horribly purifying

[CHORUS:]</i> 
And it's doubt that fills my head
Dreadful doubt dripping in dread

Leave me to live in my own world
I've had enough of yours
Follow the program and make plans
To become self-assured
Didn't end up the golden champion
Ended up on the floor

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

Paid all the dues I could afford
But what was due me got lost
Found I had gained some small respect
But I get little more
They say if at first you don't succeed
Leave well enough alone
Could never live just for the dollar
'Cause life is only unknown
