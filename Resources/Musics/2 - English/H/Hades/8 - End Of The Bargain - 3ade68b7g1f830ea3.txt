END OF THE BARGAIN

[Music - Lorenzo, Fuhrman]
[Lyrics - Tecchio]

So tell me what the hell sense does it make
To call yourself alive but to be fake?
Cause friendships full of bull cannot be saved
The true ones are the few, the proud, the brave

End of the Bargain

I thought we had a deal, a pact, a bond
To be there for each other and beyond

End of the Bargain

I learned about your talk behind my back
Your whole entire realistic act

End of the Bargain

You have to weigh the good with the bad
Some friendships end and all that's left's sad and I...
I really hope that you understand
That I don't have the time to waste with your weak plan

Guess I can't live up to my end of the bargain

I watch the world around me decay
No matter what I sing or I say or pray
We're lying to each other each day
And I'm out of this false facade with no delay

Cause I'm not gonna rot with your lot
I can't meet my end of the bargain

Time to end, not to bend
Goodbye friend who intends
To pretend truth can bend, in the end
I can't meet my end of the bargain
