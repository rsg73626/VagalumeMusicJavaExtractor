I TOO EYE

She's dynamite in bed, isn't that what's in your head?!
I see your hungry smile, you make me sicker all the while!

I'm gonna tell you what it's all about
The truth of the matter is
You're like a roach who sees a scrap of food
I call it rude, yeah!
Your middle-aged fantasies, hopeless attempts at ecstasy
So keep your eyes in your head, you know damn well
She ain't winding up in your bed!

Now I must honestly tell
That I have done it as well
You go through these things in life
But you, I can't understand
I'm just a kid, you're a man
What about your wife?!
You call yourself adult
You're just adulterous!

Can't you... I too eye
You never will... see eye to eye
See eye too eye
It's too late to... see eye to eye
You'd go and throw it all away
Just for a lousy lay
Unbelievable
Tell me is it worth all the sweat?
Only to wake up in regret
Or is your conscience simply dead?!
