SECOND DEGREE SLEEPWALKING

I hold vexations back inside of my mind
Like a dam, denying frustration, a way out
The pressure builds

[CHORUS:]</i> 
At night while my mind slumbers off at rest so deep
Hatred guides my steps as I walk in my sleep

Cold murders littered in the wake of my dream
I'm deaf to every scream

[CHORUS]

My subconscious secret to living stress-free
Is manslaughter in the second degree

[CHORUS]
