DETER-MY-NATION

They tell us to wait, yeah we'll wait but for how long
Keep us quiet, dismiss our ideas but for how long
Let's concentrate and reevaluate
The economy's sunk and we've all got to pull together to raise it up

Deter my nation

Endless campaigning, a void in your ? for how long
Promises preached, the nation's appeased but for how long
The first to complain is usually the last one to vote
Well my vote is cast, we need a national antidote

This is not certain
Preach to spread fear
I'm venting my frustration with the hope that you'll hear

Be aware of your future and who's plotting it out
If you neglect your nation you deserve to live in doubt

Well it's a wise man who opens up his mind before his mouth
Some politicians these days are in a wisdom drought

Take some pride in your country give some love to your land
Sentiment is not enough to really give a damn

They're racing again, to plant what you see but for how long
Count up your votes, gain a big lead, but for how long
We'll have to wait to face our fate
To see if from our entanglements I'll still be able to extricate

Deter my nation
Deter my nation
Deter my nation
Determination

It's so much fun to judge everyone, isn't it
