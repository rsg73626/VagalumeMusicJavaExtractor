EXIST TO RESIST

So one-dimensional
The people that pulled the strings and turned your life around
It is intentional, believe me
The way they keep you in the dark, it's how they keep you down

I exist, exist to resist

The motivation to persist
A strange intangible existence fueled everything
Accomplished up to now that time has changed perceptions viewed to
To something slightly gone askew

I exist, exist to resist

But existing to resist was lost somehow
