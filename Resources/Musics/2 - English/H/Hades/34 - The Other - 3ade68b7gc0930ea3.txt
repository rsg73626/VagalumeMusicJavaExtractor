THE OTHER

You've been crashing down ?
But then we'd all know what if something ? to entice us even more
?

The ? is yours sometime to spite in disguise
Where your deepest fears and secrets hide

[CHORUS:]
Demon over mind, it's all inside you
If you only knew, the other is just you

My name is allegiance. for we are many
We're not confined by any law or prayer
Your torture and destruction ?
In life, who told you life was ever fair

Oh no

You think you've finally met the debt, well guess again
You're only playing with ?, a blind child

[CHORUS]
