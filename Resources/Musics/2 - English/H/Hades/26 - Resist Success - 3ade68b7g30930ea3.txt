RESIST SUCCESS

Defeat our purpose
But just which fate is worse?

How long can we go on?
We cannot sell ourselves
We'll take it on our terms
No easy path to resist success
You sell out, cash flows in
Your sickly glitter grin

You've only got one chance
To take it all the way
Relax, don't go so fast
Why get so carried away?
Resist, now don't tell me what to do
Success, I'll never ever leave it up to you

We may not change the world
Who said we wanted to?
Don't curse in ignorance
Fearful of something new
Oh, open up your mind
Success is self-defined
Do what your heart commands
Despite what they demand
Resist Success
Resist Success
Don't stay within their lines
Don't scramble for the dollar signs
They'll find you if you're deserving
If your course is unswerving
Outweigh the possibility
Of market stability
You are the path to resist success
