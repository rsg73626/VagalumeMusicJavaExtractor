IN THE WORDS OF THE PROFIT

[Music - Lorenzo]
[Lyrics - Tecchio]

In The Words Of The Profit

Fly out of this world we're on, you'll get a global point of view
Altered consciousness gives a perspective that's untrue

Too late to stop it
It all went wrong
Could not prevent it
With just a song

No profit and no return from the abyss you fell into
This planet is fine for some but that was not the case for you

Too late to stop it
It all went wrong
Could not prevent it
With just a song

In The Words Of The Profit
