THE CROSS

Night calls upon my betrayal
Morn sees me denied three times
Believe in God, believe also in me
I am the way, the truth, and the Life
The truth I leave within you
You Judas, hear your fate and then carry it out
Once Satan's entered you, you'll turn right about
And Peter give your life up, or so you say
Instead your knowledge of me shall be erased
They take me away, to cast me from the world
My love won't die
Father forgive them, for they know not what they do
I have been judged to die upon the cross
These thorns released my earthly blood
Still hold your faith, aside from what you see
Bearing my cross, bearing all your sin
Oh, Golgotha, to the place of the skull
You sheep within my flock hear the truth of my life
The nails deep in my flesh, the pierce of the knife
Though evil strung me up and started time anew
Know that my life was given up for you
Open your hearts, I'll flow within
