RAPE OF PERSEPHONE

I've been around forever, watching, waiting
She was the one
Took what I wanted, what I longed for
With no remorse

Rape, in the night
To defile the pure, it takes a soul that's dark and sure
Power mad, sick, disease, no cure
Screaming murder, try to fight him away
Colors run, flag of white displayed

Rape, in the night
Never be the same, life is not a stupid, useless game
Somebody has to take the blame
Screaming murder, try to fight him away
Colors run, flag of white soiled gray

Where do you think you're going
I'll tell you where you've been
Through the glass so darkly
An angel has fallen

Rape, in the night
To defile the pure, it takes a soul that's dark and sure
Power mad, sick, disease, no cure
Screaming murder, try to fight him away
Colors run, flag of white lays frayed
Every time
