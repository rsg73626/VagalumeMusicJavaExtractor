OPINIONATE!

How 'bout we get a little honest with ourselves
Let's start to think!
We're only flaunting our lack of respect
When we argue over opinions

You!
You talk like it's a fact
I wish you could just listen to yourself and your...
Opinions!
From the way that you talk
(Opinionate!)
You'd think your word was law
A preference cannot be wrong nor right
But it's wrong to try and dispute tastes

There's so many reasons we all use to form opinions
You see we've got the right to each hold a point of view
Why fight each other, it's all in vain respect's the key
But we argue blind, each thinking he is right
We are all at fault, you know it's true
Our simple free will is completely ignored
Damned to ignorance, what will we do now?!
We've all got enough problems, why add to the strain?
A no-win situation is what we have on our hands
Over and over and over and over
We prove the fact that we can't think
Living one mulish day at a time
Convinced that our shit doesn't stink! Yeah!

This song is food for thought, we're all starving
To change your standpoint is not so alarming
The usual result of change is growth
What's your opinion we'd like to know!
Opinionate! Opinionate! Opinionate!
Opinionate! Opinionate! Opinionate! Now!
