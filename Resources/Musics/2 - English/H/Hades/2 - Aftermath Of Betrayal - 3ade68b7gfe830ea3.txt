AFTERMATH OF BETRAYAL

[The tragedy of Hamlet]
[Inspired by the play by William Shakespeare]

[ACT I]
Once past twelve sounds a bell
'Tis bitter cold at Elsinore
Three Danes await and watch the night
For the late king Hamlet's spectral sight
It comes again in warlike form
This spirit of health beckons his son
Father, king, royal Dane?
Tell me the reason why you came
I am the spirit of the king
I walk the night and burn by day
"Till the foul crimes done in my days
Of nature are burnt and purged away"
A serpents sting took my life
Now wears my crown and wed my wife
Avenge my death, remember me
Hamlet my son, kill the king!

[ACTS II and III]
A noble mind overthrown
Seized with madness
Dethrone!
Somewhat deceptive
To masque his designs
The prince will reap his vengeance in time
His lady love doth think him mad
Lord Chamberlain warns
Stay away!
The actors come hither
Presenting a play
Hamlet's intentions are underway
He has caught the conscience of the king
Railed the queen
Thought Claudius slain
Instead lay dead
The fool Chamberlain
Banished; to England Hamlet is sent

[ACT IV]
The sails were set for their destruction
Twice fell the night their ship is attacked
Death has strayed from his path to claim sweet Ophelia
The prince now returns enraged with wrath
He falls upon innocence returning to dust
Swears he laertes, Hamlet must
Pay for all grievances put on his house
Conspiracy lingers, the duel; a trap
