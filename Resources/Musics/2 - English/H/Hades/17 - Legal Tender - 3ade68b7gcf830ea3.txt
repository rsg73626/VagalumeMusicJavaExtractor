LEGAL TENDER

In God we trust
But You're not God
You make and break all the rules
Land of the free
But nothings free
'Cause even when you win you lose
LEGAL TENDER
Resist success
You know you'll have to pay the price
It makes no cents
For all thats wrong, we'll make it right
LEGAL TENDER

Monopolies
Supposed non-existent through the land
Democracy
Tell me why we never had a chance
