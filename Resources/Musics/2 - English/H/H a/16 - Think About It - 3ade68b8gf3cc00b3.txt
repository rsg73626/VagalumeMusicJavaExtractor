THINK ABOUT IT

I remember well,
Afternoons of autumn.
The promises and vows of love.
Each dried sheet on the ground,
Is a piece of my heart.
You changed our plans for someone who just wants
Make you suffer.
And there's nothing I can do, besides thinking and tell
Think about it, not to regret later

Think about it,
Think about love
Think about your life,
And their mistakes.
Think and fight,
Think without losing who you are.
Losing who you are.

When you walked out the door,
Led with my heart.
Every corner of the world I see you.
Today tells me that I am guilty,
But I sure have not forgotten me.
I can only suffer with my pain without you.

Think about it,
Think about love
Think about your life,
And their mistakes.
Think and fight,
Think without losing who you are.
Losing who you are.

What is the sense of estarcom other and remember me?
What you feel inside?
Though my tears fall,
I still have the strength to say
I love you.

Think about it,
Think about love
Think about your life,
And their mistakes.
Think and fight,
Think without losing who you are.
Losing who you are.
