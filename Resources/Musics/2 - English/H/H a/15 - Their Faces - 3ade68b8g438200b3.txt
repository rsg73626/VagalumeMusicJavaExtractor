THEIR FACES

One day,
One night,
Life goes on,
You be a disguise,
Someone who is not.

This is unavoidable, uncontrollable
For you?

Even wanting to
I can not understand,
That your game
That attracts me like a magnet.
To you

Four in the afternoom
In my appartment
Look at you.
You girl novel.

Eight in the evening,
A sunday
You seem to be ad.

I live in indecision so deep,
That makes me bang
My head
To think so.

Love you decide,
Stop fooling
With their faces
Sometimes girl, sometimes
A villain.

Hilarious, you make
Our relationship,
I love love,
If not love would not be here.
But this way is very complicated
And although I go,
I warned you, you have
Not decided.

And when you are real,
I'll be waiting for you,
With open arms.

You,you,you
Hilarious relationshio.
Sometimes a villain, sometimes a girl.
I stick, like a magnet
Their faces, their,
Only their faces.
You decide!
