REAL LIFE

I remember well,
When the person could be happy.
When hey lived in harmony,
No fights or wars.
I discovered that it was all a dream,
It was impossible

Real life is hard, I know!
But I live whit my feet
On the floor
Because
I'm afraid to fall,
And lose my self in the middle of the
Madness.

I do not know
What to expect in real life,
I do not know if I'm dreaming again
Because if this a
Nightmare.

     Refr√£o
Real life
Can hurt, can hurt
Can  shake
Do not fool me
But she do not mind to me.
