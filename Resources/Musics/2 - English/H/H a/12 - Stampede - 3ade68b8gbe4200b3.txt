STAMPEDE

The time is now.
Life does not wait.
Live intensely every moments.
Think, fight.
Conquer, lives...
Is a race against time, a stampede.
Live all you can,
Face whatever comes.
Live, grab,
Do not miss,
Do not stop.
Do not give up,
Persist, insist, invest.
Does not suffer, do not cry,
Is immortal.
Do not stop,
Do not throw in the towel,
Look farward,not look back.
Fight, conquer. you can more!
Not worth playing it all away,
Resist, persist
Long live the hustle and bustle.
Live a stampede, but alive!
