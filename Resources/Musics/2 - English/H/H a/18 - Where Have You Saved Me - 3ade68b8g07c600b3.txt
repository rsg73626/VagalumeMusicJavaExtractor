WHERE HAVE YOU SAVED ME

Where have you saved me? (2x) 

You got me now,
All this for you,
This song, this smile,this face,
All for you.

Now I wonder, where have you saved me?
In my cry,my tears, my pain...
Girl, you saved me.

Was broken,
Bruised, wounded.
Today I am whole, happy.

Where have you saved me? (2x)

Girl, you brought out in me the love.
You're inside me now.
I belong to you,
You belong to me.

I was aimless, you found me.
I was hurt, you took care of me.
I was dead, you brought me again to life.

I love you, love you very much.
You and I are perfect.
You saved me, baby

Where have you saved me? (2x)

You are one, you are special.
I searched for you in all my life.
Where you been all this time?
But what matters is that you're in my way.
Love you.

Where have you saved me?(2x)
