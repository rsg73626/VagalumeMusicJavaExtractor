INVENTIONS

Feeling alive,
And inventing a way 
For you ro notice me.
Live dreaming,
And reflecting 
Until you love me.

I prefer to do so
Turn the situation around,
Disguise the lonely 
And see,
That I love you.

For you,
I go  through horizons,
Quakes in an instant.
For both of us,
I am ale to play
In the sky or the blue sea.

Why invent,
Acts to express myself!

    Refrão
Inventions are,
I understand the world
You wanna show me
Then invention thousand ways
For you to notice
The feeling want choke me.
I want love you

For love,
I bring you thousand stars,
Going behind the springs.
For a dream,
I can invent 
Thousand ways
For us to dream.

 Want love you!

  Refrão
Inventions are,
I undrestand the world
You wanna show me
Then invention thousand ways
For you to notice
The feeling want choke me.
I want love you!
