AND US

I wish,
you want.
I love,
you like.
I have,
you think.
I walk,
you stop.
and us live
li-li-live
and us live
live-li-live

I cry,
you smile.
I say,
you listen.
I travel,
you work.
and us are perfect
perf-perf-pe-pe- perfect
and us are perfect
perf-perf-pe-pe- perfect

I write,
you read.
I'm happy,
youare sad.
and this is our end
e-e-end
