THAT'S CRAZY

That's crazy,
I done it, but you break me,
And now?
I let you girl, 
Baby, I'm full to you
Drug!drug!
You make me feel a dr.crazying!
Shit it!
That's all that I haveto say,
Love you!

Excuse my ignorance,
Would not be thick
Tell me what to do to forgive.
Was silly, I lost my head,
Kiss me!
Let's move a rubber in all this?

   Refr√£o
That's crazy!
I love you, you know it
Just no have to prove 
Believe me! this is very confusing!
Dr.crazying is asking please do not go!
I turn a romantic,
Abandon the ignorance,
Change radically for you!
