LOOK AT MIRROR

There days,
in which a simple act
becomes 
impossible.

there days,
to llok at mirror
hurts you, hurts you.

you can not believe
which it became
then put fake smile
in the face,
and hides as much who you are.
what is the point?
no!

reverse this situation,
change your image,
emptying of this complex,
be happy!

take out your mind
what you accuse,
remove the stones from your heart.
if someone hurt you, forgive.
if someone spoke badly of you, praise.
if someone  devalued, values.

do not lose who you are
the mistakes of others.
be yourself
and screw it the world.

look at mirror,
can not be difficult.
but pleasurable.

be happy, 
do not mind people.
mind to God.
forget the world!
