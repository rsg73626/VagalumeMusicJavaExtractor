EYE TO EYE (IAM SESELLES)

Drik up cause about she is my!
Eye to eye, ok? look at titanium..
Seem my heart a break, but
Never, never
Stayed at my farm
To meet me.

Marry me,
Live on me,
Eye to eye.

I can be a stupid boy,
But love you!

Old of you, your kiss is magic.
Far away, faraway.
I do'n't give a shit!

Marry me,
Live on me,
Eye to eye.

Girl your kiss is magic,
So fire to hot,
My name I don't know, baby.
So cold tonight, so what?
Elieve you cry to, cry to, by my side, to eye to eye.
E-e-eye to eye
E-e-eye to eye

I don't care, about you, lonly.
My perfect end, is so close to me.
The windows, the doors, "njô
Needs are me.
Eye to eye, yéah!
