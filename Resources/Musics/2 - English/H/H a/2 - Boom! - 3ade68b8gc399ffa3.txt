BOOM!

I see the circus catching fire,
I see parents against childrens
See the senseless violence,
The incredible is that no one see.

People need to make up
And see that 
The world is at war.
We must realize that we are 
Guilty for everything
Out of place.
 Life asks for help.

 Refr√£o
The world needs an explosion
To clear our thoughts
And make us wake up to life
The world needs a boom! boom!
Boom!boom! boom!
Loud!
