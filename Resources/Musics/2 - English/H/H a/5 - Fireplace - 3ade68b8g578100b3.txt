FIREPLACE

Fireplace,
Is you girl my girlfriend,
Fireplace,
Is tonight together you,
Fireplace, fireplace,
You are my fireplace.

Kiss me girl,
Is a winter in my heart,
Is cold night,
To think over we,
To think me,
Stay girl.
Ôôô

Keep my quest they over,
Never to think together.
And appears in the winter place,
You are my fireplace.

Fireplace,
Is you girl my girlfriend,
Fireplace,
Is tonight together you,
Fireplace, fireplace,
You are my fireplace.

Tonight, wind sure my mind words,
And give up me glad.
And my left heart is cold for you, 
My fireplace.
To me ask, buy the life is real,
Don't stop the my here!
Here, here, here.
