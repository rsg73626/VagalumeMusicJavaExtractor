CONSTELLATIONS

Ô ô ô ô ô hhh
 Prepare my spaceship,
 I fly, I touch the sky
 Go!

 I'll discover worlds,
Galaxies, constellations
Go!
Sometimes seem isolated, as if he lived
A simple soap bubble.

Let's just who is going,
Goodbye to those who stay.
Pro let's cruise the south,
Know alpha, gamma, beta, oh!

This is possible
Because the fuel is to imagine,
Is the will to persevere,
Not discouraged.

    Refrão
Constellations,
I'll find out,
I let go of everything and everyone
Will touch thesky
Whit my spaceship,
Costing one real,
I bought yesterday e.t 

He had a mission
Here in "njô"*
To dominate our minds,
To  abduct the.

Not going crazy not to!
I was an e.t spaceship sold!
Hecame from
^venus to discover 
The rot "njô"


     *"njô" é a expressão que h.a usa para falar do planeta terra.
