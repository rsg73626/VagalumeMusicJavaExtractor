WHAT I GOT TO SAY?

Was a frightening reaction,
A side effect.
You got the bags,
Laid on the door,
Oppened the window
Threw a world of words that  harm,hurt.

All this for nothing
You threw me out of your life.
For a reason best.
Simply by their friends,
You left your  love.

I'm so
Why expect it from you.
Simply do know what I say.
I think now,
The silense speaks for both of us.

But you better be right,
Not  to regret later.

What I got to say?
Wha-wha- what I got to say?
The silence speaks for us.

I'm just 
Broken inside,
Outside noise...
Totally aimless.

I went looking for a way
To forget you.
Today, all that
Made me grow up,
Made me to be someone else.
I won! 

If I had stopped, dropped out,
Would not be here
At the top.
And you?
His friend are gone?
Huh?
Now it's to late.
Today, I'm happy
Without you.
And 
What I got to say?
Who knows, were wrong
Or acted without thinking,
I'm  not interested.

Good,
Now I live my life
And say you lost,
