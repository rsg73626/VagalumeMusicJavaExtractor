COTTON PICKERS

There are lovers
There are mothers
There are winners
There are weepers
And there are saviours
And there are sinners, dreamers, doers, talkers, leaders
There are times when I feel 

That we are all cotton pickers
We are all cotton pickers
We are all [?] wishers
We are all cotton pickers 

There are monsters
There are monarchs
There are fiends
There are beggars
There are believers
There are hoaxers, hustlers, hagglers, paupers, taunters
There are times when I feel 

(chorus X2)
