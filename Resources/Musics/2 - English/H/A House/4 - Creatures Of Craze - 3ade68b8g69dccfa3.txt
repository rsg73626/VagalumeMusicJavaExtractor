CREATURES OF CRAZE

And we all dance and we all sing
And we all crave, we all cave in
And we all lust and we all flirt
And we all love, we all get hurt
For we are creatures, creatures of craze
Creatures, creatures of craze
Creatures, creatures of 

Same, same, same, same
Same, same, same, same 

And we all preach and we all dream
And we all observe and we all cry and we all scream
And we all try hard and we all despair 

(chorus) 

And we all mourn, we scorn and we sneer
And we all cheat and we scoff and we swear and we all lie
We live, we die, we all feel pain
And we all bleed and we breathe and we plead
And we all build and we work we break down
And we all strive, we thrive, deprive and some survive 

(chorus)
