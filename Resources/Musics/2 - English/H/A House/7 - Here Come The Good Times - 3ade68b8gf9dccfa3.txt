HERE COME THE GOOD TIMES

Ooooooo!
Ooooooo!
Ooooooo!
It's been a long time since rock and roll
It all sounds good but it's filled with holes
It's been a long time since the seventies
Nowadays everyone's taking themselves too seriously
So if you believe in make believe
Then you can make yourself believe in me 

Here come the good times
Here come the good times
Here come the good times
For a change
For a change 

It's been a long time since I've heard you laugh
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile
It's been a long time since our wide-eyed dreams
The closer we get to them the less they mean
It takes a long time for the scars to heal
Why won't you tell me how you feel 

(chorus) 

Wooooooooo!
Wooooooooo!
Wooooooooo!
Where have all the good times gone
Where have they all gone
It's good to see you laugh again
It's good to see you smile again
It's good to hear you laughing one more time 

Cos here come the good times
Here come the good times
Here come the good times
For a change
It makes a nice change
It's good to see you
It's good to see you smile
It's good to see you
It's good to see you laugh
It's good to see you
It's good to see you talk
It's good to see you
It's good to see you laugh
It's good to see you smiling one more time
(Here come the good times)
For a change for a change
(Here come the good times)
Merry Christmas baby!
Here come the good times for a change
