THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH

Down let it down
Make it all up
Now go home
You [?]
Tell those bigger lies
You tell too well
That's all that matters boys
The story 'll sell
If you believe what they're saying
You've read the profile
Read it again
'Cause they say so
It's not how many songs
It's how many scars
'Cause they say so
They've got it all wrong 

That's not the truth
No, no, no,
That's not the truth
No, no, no,
And if you believe that that's the truth, the whole truth
Take it all down
Some stupid, bloody hypocrite is sitting on my shoulder 

Now, [?]
Open your mouth
Before your heart
And fabricate
It's too late
You look the fool
No, not I
And just for one minute
If you could jump into your world
Now write a script, not a scroll
You're young not old
Now say so
Now you've got it made
Now you get paid and that's what matters
You've got it all wrong 

That's not the truth
No, no, no,
That's not the truth
No, no, no,
And if you believe that's the truth, the whole truth
Then take it all down
Some stupid, poxy journalist is sitting on my shoulder 

That's not the truth
No, no, no,
That's not the truth
No, no, no,
That's not the truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
