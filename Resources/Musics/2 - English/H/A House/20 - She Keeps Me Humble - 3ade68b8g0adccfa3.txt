SHE KEEPS ME HUMBLE

I am nervous around you
I am what you are
I am mad about you
I am what you are
So near and far away
From what you want 

I am what you are
I'm there when you call me
I am who you know
I follow your shadow
I am what you see
I am what I think you want me to be
I am what you are
So near and far away 

She keeps me down
She keeps me humble
She keeps me down, down, down
She keeps me humble 

She keeps me from
Losing my head
Keeping my edge
She keeps me down
Down in the ground
I'm not uptight when she's not around
She keeps me down 

I'm nervous around you
I am what you are
I am mad about you
I am what you are
So near and far away
From what you need
I am bought and sold
Body and soul
With no guarantees
Of her loving me
I wish she could try
Or just leave me be
I am what you are
So near and far away 

(chorus) 

She keeps me from losing my head
Keeping my edge
She puts me down, down in the crowd
I'm not uptight
When she's not around
She keeps me down 

(chorus) 

She keeps me from losing my head
Keeping my edge
She keeps me down
Down in the ground
I'm not uptight when she's not around
She keeps me down
