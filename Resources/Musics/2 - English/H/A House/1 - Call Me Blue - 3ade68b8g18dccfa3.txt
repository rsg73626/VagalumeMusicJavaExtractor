CALL ME BLUE

What a great world we all live in
Even better, what a time to be here
So break a leg now
Soon all the world will be a stage
Too many actors sitting on high chairs 

Call me blue
Call me blue again
Call me blue
Call me blue 

Sold your soul now
Too much bathroom music
It turns your brain to slush
When you watch too much
On the TV, on the radio
Turn it up now, cause that don't turn it off no
We need cotton pickers we need [?]
Don't press on too hard 

(chorus)
