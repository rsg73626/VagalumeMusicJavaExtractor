I WANTED TOO MUCH

There was a time I wanted too much
And now's a time I don't want anything
No point in crying over milk that's too rich
No point in dying over blood that's not spilt 

I don't want children
I don't want to have to raise them
I don't want to be a family man
Because I know that I can 

I don't want you
I don't want to need you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to lose you 

There was a place we used to go
And now that place is overgrown
What you never had you'll never have
What you've always missed
Because blood runs too rich 

(chorus) 

I don't want you
