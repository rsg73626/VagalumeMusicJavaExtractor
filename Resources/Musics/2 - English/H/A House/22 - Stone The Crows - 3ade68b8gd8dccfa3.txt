STONE THE CROWS

I've said before
This is such [?]
I could sound like Mel and Kim
Wouldn't that be nice 

Stone the crows
Stone all the hacks
Stone the S.A.W.
Why don't you stone, stone me 

I have no heart
I have no song
You can always trust on a S.A.W.
To make things go wrong 

Stone the crows
Stone all the S.A.W.s
Stone all the hacks
Why don't you stone, stone me 

I'm programmed to
I'm told what to do
I'm good looking, dumb and tall
Now I've got it all 

Stone the crows
Stone all the hacks
Stone the S.A.W.
Why don't you stone, stone me
Why don't you stone, stone me, me, me, me, me, me
