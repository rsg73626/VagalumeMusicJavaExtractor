I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL

Nine long months you've spent thinking of me
And all the following years
Spent between the laughter and tears
Self-denial you gave, too good to shout it out loud
There's a second love, but blood is thicker than skin 

I'll always be grateful
I'll always be grateful
I'll always be grateful
For you 

And the man's done his best with those old-fashioned ways
And I know you've tried hard, I can see it in your face
If I had of known then what I could have known now
I hate to patronize and even more I hate to criticize 

(chorus) 

I must be painfully dull to do what I have done
By not showing love to those people that I love
But, still you accept what I've done proving time and time again
That someday I realize, but by then it's all too late 

(chorus) 

And I'll never be hateful
