WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU

When I first saw you
When I first saw you
I was entranced with you
I was in love with ... somebody else 

When I first met you
When I first met you
I was in awe of you
I needed to have you 

God you're beautiful, you really are
God I need you now, I need you now 

You're the only one that I
The only one that I
Will ever need
