HOW STRONG IS LOVE

How strong is love
How strong is love
How strong is your love, love, love 

Tell me tell me how strong
Tell me tell me how strong
Tell me tell me how strong is your love 

What will it take for you to see
The devil in me, the angles free
How many times, how many lies
Before you finally realize
Just what it takes, just what it takes 

If I hit you will you hit me back
If I scream at you will you scream at me back
Can you not trust me or where I've been
If I go through hell will you come with me 

(chorus) 

Tell me tell me how strong
Tell me tell me how strong
Tell me tell me how strong is your love 

Do you know how strong your love is?
