I LIED

When I said
When I said that I loved you
I lied 

When I said
When I said that I need you
I lied 

To get what I so richly deserve 

When I said
When I told you that you were my best friend
I lied 

When I said
When I swore that I won't hurt you
I lied 

To get what I to get what I so richly deserved 

Because I
I even lied to myself
The truth is so often dull and uninspired
Dull and uninspired 

I sit back and I make it all up
I sit back and I make it all up in my make-believe chair 

I'm the only one that gets hurt
I'm the only one that gets hurt
I'm the only one that gets hurt 

When I said, when I said
When I said, when I found
I don't love you anymore
I lied, I lied, I lied
I adore you 

When I said, when I need you
I want you, I'll stay with you
In sickness and health, for richer or poorer
I lied, I lied, I lied, I lied
And I will lie again 

So when I say, when I say
When I say, when I say
I put you before even life itself
I lied, I lied, I lied
For I am still alive 

To get what I
To get what I so richly deserve 

Because I
I even lied to myself
The truth is so often
Dull and uninspired
Dull and uninspired
