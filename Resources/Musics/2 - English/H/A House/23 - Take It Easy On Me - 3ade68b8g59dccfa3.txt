TAKE IT EASY ON ME

Why do you treat me so cruel
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Why must you always disapprove
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
What have I ever done to you
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me 

For if you keep on pushing me
I'll lose my grip on reality
If you treat me delicately
I will last forever
So put me up on your pedestal
All you have to do is love me, baby 

Don't make me look like a fool
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Don't build me up then knock me down
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Don't think I don't know you get around
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me 

Oh what have you got that I have loved
What can they give you that I can not
Do the blinkers from your eyes
See through their disguise
If you get worn and abused
You'll be back to me
Won't you baby 

Once again you will promise that you
You will always wear kid gloves
You will promise me that you
You will give me the whole world
You will promise me that you
You will treat me like you should 

Don't build me up then knock me down
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself
Don't think I don't know you get around
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself
Don't make me look like your clown
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself 

Take it ... take it easy
I don't believe you
I can't understand you
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself 

Take it ... take it easy
How can I believe you this time
Why should this time be any different than the others
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself 

Take it ... take it easy
So go on then
Crawl back to the others and see if they will have you
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself 

Take it ... take it easy
For the first time in my life
I feel like ... really good
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself 

Take it ... take it easy
Go on then, on your bike
Good Luck to you.
Take it easy on me
Make it easy on yourself 

Mind you don't fall
Around the corner
Ha
