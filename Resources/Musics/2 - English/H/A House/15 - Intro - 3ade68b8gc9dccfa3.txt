INTRO

Picture a house
With hanging baskets
On a quiet little street
On the corner where the lamp shows
A beautiful garden
And perfect cut lawns
All the young people play hide and seek
But inside there's a monster
Who makes demands
He says "Do what I want - not what I say."
And everyone lives in fear
Will the man responsible
Will the man responsible
Take a bow
