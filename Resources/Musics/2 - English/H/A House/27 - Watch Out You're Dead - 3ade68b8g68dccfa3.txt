WATCH OUT YOU'RE DEAD

Get get on up
Get get on down
I can see your face
It looks like mine
No need to paint your face white
No need for a suntan 

Put your head on the tracks
Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, close
I can see the light
Steel on steel, steel on steel, steel on steel, steel on steel, steel on
steel, steel
Here comes the train, train, train, train
Watch out you're dead
Train, train, train, train
Watch out your dead
Train, train, train, train
Watch out you're dead 

Get, get on up
Get, get back down again
I can see your church, it looks like mine
No need for a protest, what we need is a prospect 

(chorus)
