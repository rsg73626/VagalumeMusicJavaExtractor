FREAK OUT

When they gonna drop the big one
It's gonna be sooner than you think
Don't be a drag, be a scalliwag
Go out and get a new haircut 

Freak out, honey
Freak out 

Don't take a bite from forbidden fruit
All is not fair in love and war
Take your hand from your trousers
Taught to be a boy, not a man, get a girlfriend 

Freak out, honey
Freak out 

Time to be a weirdo
Go on be a devil
Wow! Baby, that's cool! Groovy! Far out!
Dig a big hole and jump in 

Freak out, honey
Freak out 

Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha ha 

Had a free ticket [?]
Jeanie got snagged
Wear a loud shirt
Got a clap on the back
Dream about the beach boy
You can be a holiday
Lots of sun, fun
And a [?] 

Freak out, honey
Freak out 

You can have you cake and eat it
Serve yourself to me on a plate
Learn from the past [?]
And not your [?]
Go on your own
You have to blow your own jumper [?] 

Freak out, honey
Freak out
Freak out, freak out
