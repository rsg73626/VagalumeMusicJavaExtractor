VIOLENT LOVE

You know I love you
For the next ten minutes at least
Why can't we get married
Then let the boredom set in 

Vi vi vi vi violent love
Vi vi vi vi violent love
Vi vi vi vi violent love
Violent love 

Now you've hit her
But you didn't mean to hit too hard
At least not the first time
Or the second or the third of the fourth time 

(chorus) 

Another quick one in the hand
Later I can give to my wife
When I get home
I'm sure she's waiting up there 

(chorus)
