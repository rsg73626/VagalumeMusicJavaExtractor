LOVE QUARRY

Babe, you're driving me mad
If you drive any faster, I'm dead
I've bent over backwards, bent upside down
The bags under my eyes
Try to understand
You owe me that much 

Take me to the love quarry
Take me to the love quarry 

Babe, what do I have to do
There's got to be a way to impress you
Fast cars, fast holidays, fast lights
Is that what you want
You can't see further than your next ambition
You're a mental acrobat with [?] addiction 

Take me to the love quarry
Take me to the love quarry 

Cutie pie
I can call you that
Can't I
Now that we're lovers
Piling on the agony
Playing violins to unfinished symphonies 

Take me to the love quarry
Take me to the love quarry
Why don't you take, take, take, take me to the love quarry
Why don't you take, take, take, take me to the love quarry
