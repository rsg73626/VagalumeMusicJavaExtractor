LOVE OF THE EIGHTIES

Call in the bellringer
Call in the preacher
Call out the army
Call out the government warning 

Love of the eighties
Love, love of the eighties 

Call out the science man
And give him the poor hand
Call out the advertising campaign
And the media and the press, because 

Love of the eighties
Love, love of the eighties
