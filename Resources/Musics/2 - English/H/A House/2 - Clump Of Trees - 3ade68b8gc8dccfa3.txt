CLUMP OF TREES

How can I say just how I feel
Do you not know, or is this not real dear
One thing I know, there's blood in a stone 

Imagine a weight inside my chest
If you should go that weight would crush my bones dear
And what makes it worse is that this really hurts 

Like a clump of trees
Don't cut me down
Evergreen
Sometimes blue
Evergreen
Sometimes blue
And you can not see the wood for a clump of trees
Trees, trees
Bah do do do 

Like a star when it falls its light lingers on
Just like my heart just a little more slowly
From the sea, to the roots, to the trees
It's burning time once more
And more and more times
Must the trees fall down
To leave my heart linger on 

Like a clump of trees
Don't cut me down
Evergreen
Sometimes blue
Evergreen
Sometimes blue
When you can not see the wood for a clump of trees
Like a clump of trees
Don't cut me down
Evergreen
Sometimes blue
Evergreen
Sometimes blue
And you can not see
Can not see
Can not see the wood for a clump of trees
