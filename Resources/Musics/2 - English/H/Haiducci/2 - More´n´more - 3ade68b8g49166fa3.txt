MORE´N´MORE

want to get to people 
I want to sing to people 
I want to sing I'm falling in love with you 

I know my life is changing 
I feel today is magic 
I feel you too are falling in love with me 

It's your manager falling in love 
It's your manager song 


Refrão: 

I feel I love you more and more 
I feel I need you more and more 
I feel I'm looking for your body more and more 

I feel I want you more and more 
whatever you make, whenever you go 
I think to go forever only where you go 


I want to get to people 
I want to sing to people 
I want to sing I'm falling in love with you 

I know my life is changing 
I feel today is magic 
I feel you too are falling in love with me 

It's your manager falling in love 
It's your manager song 

Refrão

Whoai oh! 
Whoai oh! 
Whoai oh! 
Whoai oh oh! 

Whoai oh! 
Whoai oh! 
Whoai oh! 
Whoai oh oh!
