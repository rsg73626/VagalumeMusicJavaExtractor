A HAND WRITTEN APOLOGY

I’m sorry
I never meant to hurt you
Look in my eyes… 

She’s so beautiful
She has a way with words
I had my way with her
Oh how unfortunate
I left her here in this empty nest
Awaiting the Seraphim
With prayers unanswered and unblessed 

I’m sorry
I never meant to hurt you
Look in my eyes… 

She’s so delicate and elegant
It makes me sick
Oh, don’t be deceived
I treat her like a glass menagerie
And this time I won’t scream
I’ll whisper softly and I’ll sing 

I’m sorry
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you 

If I could wish it all away
If I could wish it all away
I would wish it all away
If I could wish it all away… 

I’m sorry
I never meant to hurt you
Look in my eyes… 

I’m wishing away
And I’m waiting for something
I’m sitting around
And I ain’t getting nothing
