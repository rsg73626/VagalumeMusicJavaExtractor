SHE PAID FOR ME IN SINGLES

Go on and do what you gotta do
'cuz I refuse to make the first move
This waiting is such abuse
Oh, you're loving it?
Well, I am not amused
Don't threaten me with a good time
I think you should leave tonight
Maybe I should take my own advice
But it's hard to when you...

Lick your lips, you shake your hips
Oh my God, those eyes looking into mine
Baby!
We're breathing in rhythm and you're making me sweat
I can barely stand the thought of it
Baby!

What if in the beginning, before we would even start
We'd break the laws of attraction to avoid a broken heart

You say I take your breath away
Make your heart skip a beat
Make your body shake
'til you're weak in the knees and can't hardly speak
You shouldn't have to disguise your truths with alibis
Maybe I should take my own advice
But it's hard to when you...

Lick your lips, you shake your hips
Oh my God, those eyes looking into mine
Baby!
We're breathing in rhythm and you're making me sweat
I can barely stand the thought of it
Baby!

What if in the beginning, before we would even start
We'd break the laws of attraction to avoid a broken heart
(x2)

Slow, you roll
You'll slowly find your way home
To show a different side of you
A point of view, obscure and it's skewed
So go on and do what you gotta do
So go on and make your move

So put on those boots just to take it off baby
And dance until you ain't got no heart
So, so put on those boots just to take it off baby
And dance until you ain't got no heart

What if in the beginning, before we would even start
We'd break the laws of attraction to avoid a broken heart
(x2)

(So put on those boots just to take it off baby
And dance until you ain't got no heart)
