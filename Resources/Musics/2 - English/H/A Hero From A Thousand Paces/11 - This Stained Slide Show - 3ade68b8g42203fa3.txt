THIS STAINED SLIDE SHOW

I’m holding on to the moment
I let go of you
Tainted by your kiss that stains my precious lips
As sadness shades a portrait of your sins
I did it once and never again
Take what you need
There’s not much left of me

All I can see is the pain that lies for us ahead
We said we would never let it come to this
We don’t know
We don’t know us anymore
We don’t know
We don’t know us anymore

I know we said that we would never act like this
Two young foolish lovers rushing in
Like there were no consequences
We were kids, invincible and great
Now mother said good things are bound to change
A beauty queen transformed into a heart break
A non-trusting gentleman that made one too many mistakes
Oh and by the way, one of them was you

All I can see is the pain that lies for us ahead
We said we would never let it come to this
We don’t know
We don’t know us anymore
We don’t know
We don’t know us anymore
