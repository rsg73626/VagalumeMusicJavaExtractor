THE AFTERMATH

That girl she's awfully pretty now.
She's something else, she makes me move
To all the guys trying to get some tonight
Move over, Move over, I'm coming through

I approach on with all the right words to say.
She's not used to this sort of thing
She bites her lip,and I can tell that she's nervous
And every line delieved has served its purpose

Hidden are your skeletons in your closet
Well, I do believe you owe me an apology

I draw my guns to defend their pride
Let's ditch this place and head to mine.
Every corner here is screaming were whispers
We head out and she's begging me to kiss her

The rooms cold but the beds even colder
It's over and she wants me to hold her
She cracks a smile and she starts to confess
She needs me right now
Well bitch it's gonna happen

Hidden are your skeletons in your closet
Well, I do believe you owe me an apology
So come on, let's hear it.

You wanted this to happen
Please don't hate me in the morning
We breathe intimacy
Just one night, and you have warning
Affairs are risky buisness
It's not my fault
the devil made me do it
You wanted this to happen
Please don't hate me
Please don't hate me

Hidden are your skeletons in your closet
Well, I do believe you owe me an apology
So come on, let's hear it.

Hidden are your skeletons in your closet
Well, I do believe you owe me an apology
