BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL

The story told was a load about the bold and the beautiful
People that never grow old
They die young and alone
There's a difference between cowards and courage that I've seen
Hidden deep inside of everybody

You play with fire and you'll get burned
You'll get what you deserve
So watch your mouth or you'll get hurt
So watch your mouth or you'll get hurt
Cover up those lies, unless you cover up your eyes
I'll always know the truth
Hidden inside of you

This life of entertainment
Has been built on things like hatred
For the things we used to love
I'll be the best secret you keep
Lock me up and throw away the key
So don't say a thing
Hush no please don't say a thing

You play with fire and you'll get burned
You'll get what you deserve
So watch your mouth or you'll get hurt
So watch your mouth or you'll get hurt
Cover up those lies, unless you cover up your eyes
I'll always know the truth
Hidden inside of you

You play with fire and you'll get burned
You'll get what you deserve
So watch your mouth or you'll get hurt
So watch your mouth or you'll get hurt
Cover up those lies, unless you cover up your eyes
I'll always know the truth
Hidden inside of you
