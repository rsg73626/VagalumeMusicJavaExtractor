CLOSE YOUR EYES

Close your eyes 
Sleep tight tonight 
When you wake up in the morning 
I’ll be gone 
To prove you wrong 
There’s nothing you can say 
That will ever change me and my ways 

So you love making lists 
And crossing things off of it 
I never knew that I’d be one of them 
Surprise, surprise 
Open up your eyes 
I always knew cameras could capture lives 
I never knew they captured lies 
Just the same they capture time 
Now you’re biting bullets and swallowing your pride 
Snap, snap 
Take a photograph 
You will never get me back 

Close your eyes 
Sleep tight tonight 
When you wake up in the morning 
I’ll be gone 
To prove you wrong 
There’s nothing you can say 
That will ever change me 

Imbed your thoughts into my vocal cords 
Until I can’t bare to sing anymore 
I bet if you could make one wish 
Your life would be completely different 
So perfect and romantic 
With the taste of my lips 
To poison every kiss 
That you just give away 
And I will pray for you 
No matter what…sinner 

Close your eyes 
Sleep tight tonight 
When you wake up in the morning 
I’ll be gone 
To prove you wrong 
There’s nothing you can say 
That will ever change me and my ways 

I found this to be sad but true 
I would expect nothing less from you 
An apology filled with I’s and Me’s 
I guess I never really had any needs 
I gave you everything that I ever had 
I gave it to you, good or bad 
What else could you possibly want? 
All that I have left is my blood 

So I caught that bird for you 
To sing you that tune 
A reminder I still love you 
I do, I swear I really do 
It means the world to me 
What does it mean to you? 
And I say if this is just a game 
Then I refuse to play 
I’ll walk away just to say… 

Close your eyes 
Sleep tight tonight 
When you wake up in the morning 
I’ll be gone 
To prove you wrong 
And there’s nothing you can say 
That will ever change me
