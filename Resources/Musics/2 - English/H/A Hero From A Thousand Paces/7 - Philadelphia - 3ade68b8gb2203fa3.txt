PHILADELPHIA

If I could just paint you a picture of the two of us
Sitting on a park bench in Philadelphia
With your hand in mine, as strangers walk by
I look you in the eyes and told you just how I feel

And I knew that you were worth the wait
I waited too long and now its too late

I won't forget you, you were once my love
Hope you don't forget the two of us
I won't forget you, you were once my love
Hope you don't forget the two of us

Let me ask a question, I need some answering
Have you been emptied of every little thing
That you felt for me
Deep inside you're moving on, your moving on
You've said your goodbyes

And I knew that you were worth the wait
I waited too long now its too late

I won't forget you, you were once my love
Hope you don't forget the two of us
I won't forget you, you were once my love
Hope you don't forget the two of us

I've been drawn in color, I've been drawn to you like a long time lover
I've been drawn in color, I've been drawn to you like a long time lover
I've been drawn in color, I've been drawn to you like a long time lover

And I knew that you were worth the wait
I waited too long now its too late

I won't forget you, you were once my love
Hope you don't forget the two of us
I won't forget you, you were once my love
Hope you don't forget the two of us
Do you remember when we first met
Do you remember when we first kissed
Remember when you told that you'd always love me
You'll never forget me
You will never forget me

Hope you don't forget the two of us
Hope you don't forget the two of us
