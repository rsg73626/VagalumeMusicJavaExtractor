SEMANTICS

Sure hope you enjoy the conversation
Hope it was worth aggravating me
This guy is in line for my lady
If I could alter time just to change a situation

I hope one day you'll find the truth
About those two
The best friend and the lover
You'll soon discover that they never told you a God damn thing
It's been years since I've seen you
And I think it's about time that you knew
Everything you were denied and refuse
Will be coming back to haunt you

Double-crossed
Betrayed
You were lied to
And deceived

I made mistakes but I'm taking them back now
Dead set, caught up on my way out
Don't you know, for crying out loud
That this is so hard

Sure hope you enjoy the conversation
Hope it was worth aggravating me
This guy is in line for my lady
If I could alter time just to change a situation

What? You can't think, are you kidding me?
This influential third-party catastrophe
Has got you so wrapped up that you can't breathe
Or even speak to me

Double-crossed
Betrayed

I made mistakes but I'm taking them back now
Dead set, caught up on my way out
Don't you know, for crying out loud
That this is so hard
I've made mistakes but I'm taking them back now
Dead set, caught up on my way out
Don't you know, for crying out loud
That this is so hard

I'll politely decline
These words taste like poison
I'll politely decline
These words taste like poison

I made mistakes but I'm taking them back now
Dead set, caught up on my way out
Don't you know, for crying out loud
That this is so hard
I've made mistakes but I'm taking them back now
Dead set, caught up on my way out
Don't you know, for crying out loud
That this is so hard
(I'll politely decline
These words taste like poison)


I'll politely decline
These words taste like poison
