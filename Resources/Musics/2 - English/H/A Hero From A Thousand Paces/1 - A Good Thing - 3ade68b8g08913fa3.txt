A GOOD THING

You say this apple is medicine
Go on and swallow it
It’s harder to digest
When the poison lies in your stomach
Oh my god it hurts
Just the thought of you with him
His hand makes its way up your skirt
Your fingers clenched tight to his shirt

Now suddenly this tragedy
And every little thing
That you said to me
Is breaking me down until i’m nothing
All this rests on your shoulders
I’ll tell you everything when you get older
You should have took your time just to think things over

Stop
My allegations right
You were with him all night
While i am abandoned here by our affiance
Wait, i don’t want to know
How’d you get those wrinkled clothes?
Your makeup is running
And you reek of him and his cologne

And suddenly this tragedy
And every little thing
That you said to me
Is breaking me down until i’m nothing
All this rests on your shoulders
I’ll tell you everything when you get older
You should have took your time to think things over

Nobody wants too much of a good thing

All this rests on your shoulders
I’ll tell you everything when you get older
You should have took your time to think things over

And now it’s time for all of this to come crashing down
Into the ground where we’ll be buried
And i will find you my hummingbird
As i call your name fall towards my arms
We’ll cross over the vale
