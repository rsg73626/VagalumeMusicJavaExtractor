IT'S NOT OVER

Say that you’re safe
Tell me that you’re all right
Come on now
Slip inside embracing arms tonight
It was six miles outside the city skylines
And every tear that fell gave life to the streetlights

And everything it was that you thought that you wanted to say
This has turned into a very bad day
And these bones, they are so brittle
That they break with every mistake that we make
The hardest thing to believe is that you’re hardly breathing
Looking down, you never said goodbye
So say goodbye now

Was it your face?
Or was it a dream?
It doesn’t really matter to me, you see
Just the other day a laugh and a smile
You’re lying in my arms on these blood-stained tiles

And everything it was that you thought that you wanted to say
This has turned into a very bad day
And these bones, they are so brittle
That they break with every mistake that we make
The hardest thing to believe is that you’re hardly breathing
Looking down, you never said goodbye
So say goodbye now
The hardest thing to believe is that you’re hardly breathing
Looking down, you never said goodbye
So say goodbye now

Tell me anything
But don’t tell me that it’s over
It’s not over

The hardest thing to believe
Is that you’re hardly breathing
Looking down, you never said goodbye
So say goodbye now

Tell me anything
But don’t tell me it’s over
It’s not over
