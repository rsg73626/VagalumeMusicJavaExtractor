WITH CLOSED FISTS

She paints her face just to hide his bruises
I've got bad news, it's totally useless
'til one day, the spider left the house
I climbed on top of her, kissed her on the mouth
Everybody knows what's going down tonight
I'm on the edge, on the verge of uptight
It's not alright, I'm in a panic and I'm sweating
Cut the butterfly out, please pass the knife

System overload, surge malfuntion
Aching for your love
Starved and malnourished
We've been tarnished with a kiss
There goes our precious innocence
It's such a sin, she keeps running back to him
With closed fists, he's got her convinced
And it's an imperfection that I keep perfecting
I keep picking you and it's the wrong selection

Baby, report to the dance floor
I can't take this anymore
Your boyfriends waiting at the front door
I must be crazy to want more
A kiss seems so innocent, oh, I'm sure
Call me crazy but I want more
Maybe we can slip out the back door
I can't take this anymore

(Sha-shake me, wake me up please
Sha-shake me, wake me up) [Acoustic version]
Sha-shake me, wake me up please
And make sure I'm not dreaming

Standing there, right next to me
Tuh-tuh-touch me
Let's get dirty

Baby, report to the dance floor
I can't take this anymore
Your boyfriends waiting at the front door
I must be crazy to want more
A kiss seems so innocent, oh, I'm sure
Call me crazy but I want more
Maybe we can slip out the back door
I can't take this anymore

Sha-shake me, wake me up please
