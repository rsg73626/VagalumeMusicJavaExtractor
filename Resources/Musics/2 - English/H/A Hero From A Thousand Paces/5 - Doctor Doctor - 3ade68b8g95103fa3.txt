DOCTOR DOCTOR

Another case of bad addiction
Pump fire through my veins
Leaving scars all across my skin
My heart is hollow in my chest
Vulnerable and desperate
The moment I lost my breath

I can't wait 'til my pupils dilate
So I can celebrate the find of a guide
To take me to the other side of life

I'm falling
I hear the angels calling out my name
They keep stalking me
So if you angels want me, come and get me
I'll stand right by your side

Once again I'm beating up myself
Putting me through Hell
So I know that I'm still living
Tattered and torn apart
Will my name light the spark the day I'm gone
Or am I truly gone for good

I can't wait 'til my pupils dilate
So I can celebrate the find of a guide
To take me to the other side of life

I'm falling
I hear the angels calling out my name
They keep stalking me
So if you angels want me, come and get me
I'll stand right by your side

Tonight, we will ask ourselves, "Why?"
Why, why do I always seem to fall apart (x6)

(I'm falling
I hear the angels call
They keep stalking me
If you want me, come and get me
I'll stand right by your side)
