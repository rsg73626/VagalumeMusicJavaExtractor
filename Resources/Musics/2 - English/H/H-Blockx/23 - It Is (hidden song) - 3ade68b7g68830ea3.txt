IT IS (HIDDEN SONG)

It is the shanty in the dear park 
the hide and seek till after dark 
the talks we had at picked fences 
create the blueprints in my heart 
of the way we are 

the way we are... 

I see them sliding down on brook bridge 
in tiny boots on icy streets 
the gang we had was so almighty 
tell me the blueprints of my heart 
I wonder where they are...
