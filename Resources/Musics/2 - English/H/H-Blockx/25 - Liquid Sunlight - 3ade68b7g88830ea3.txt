LIQUID SUNLIGHT

fire shines through my liquid sunlight 
thoughts of those I love hurt my head 
and with another gulp I'll wash them 
down to stop them spinning me around 

I smell the scent of your bitterness so sweet 
caress your body, caressing my need 
the colours of gold that you show me 
bleed into seas I never see when you leave me in 

liquid sunlight... 

timeless I walk on a tight rope 
timeless I'd fall timeless I hope 
senseless my wonders and liquid is my dope 
but sense is no wonder so sunlights my hope 

so shine on with me you crazy diamond 
you cover what's real cause you are my friend 
we'll stagger outside, are we on a, are we on a flight? 
my liquid sunlight shining inside 

liquid sunlight... 

don't ask me why I'm flying so high man 
don't ask me why I'm living a lie 
ask me where and why am I laying 
under the sun as the night is aside
