ONE DAY

it was a cold night late in june 
drunk and I didn't know what to do 
till I ran into someone new to find it's you 

you smiled at me and closed your eyes 
you kissed away your summer lies 
embraced my worn out silhuette 
and said: "You're mine" 

I try to flee from what I need 
you lost the way though you're top seated 
I killed a dream sowed to the bottom of my mind 

oh, one day I'll find you 
one day I'll make our dreams come true 
one day I'll find a way to love you 
oh 

you were the victim of all lies 
I carried with me on my mind 
a little girl just had to fade to find me trusting you 

now sunlight's there to wake the day, you can express I can't explain 
may be the second that fate meant us to meet again 

your arms give me security, no scent of fatal ambiguity 
I've never felt this way before on a sunny winterday 

oh, one day I'll find you 
one day I'll make our dreams come true 
one day I'll find a way to love you 
oh 

one day 
one day 
one day 

it was a cold night late in june 
drunk and I didn't know what to do 
till I ran into someone new to find it showed 

your arms give me security, no scent of fatal ambiguity 
I've never felt this way before on a sunny winterday 

oh, one day I'll find you 
one day I'll make our dreams come true 
one day I'll find a way to love you 
oh 
one day believe me 
one day you'll make a blind man see 
one day you'll find me saying I love you 
oh
