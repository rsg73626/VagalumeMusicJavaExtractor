LIFE IS FEELING DIZZY

Life is feeling dizzy, life is feeling dizzy, 
Life is feeling dizzy, life is feeling dizzy, 

Yeah, I'm in the mood to feel the groove 
I'm gonna push it down and I'm on the move 
Life stands still, for a minute I chill 
My mind is up on a onetrack highway ill- 
Communication is a matter of I 
Ain't got no place to go 
Ain't got no place to hide 
I need to know what I'm all about, 
I try to dig it, damned I'm out 
I need to go - don't go - where I wanna go 
I'm in the know - no, no, no... 
Life is a treasure that I have to find 
I'm looking for the plan that is hidden in my mind... 

Chorus: 
Stuck in the middle of, 
Stuck in the middle of, 
Stuck in the middle of - life 

Life is feeling dizzy, life is feeling dizzy 

Yeah, I'm on my way to get it going on, 
fucked when I'm stuck in the middle of life goes on, 
I got to carry on down with soul, 
damned I try to move on. 
But where I stop is in the middle of life, 
beacause I can't figure out the midst in I why 
was I born and why do I have to die, 
I don't know because I'm stuck in the middle 
of life, and now I go and I say good bye, 
I know it's sad and I try to cry 
I try to run and I don't lie, 
I wanna die cause I'm stuck in the middle of life 

Chorus 

Life is feeling dizzy, life is feeling dizzy
