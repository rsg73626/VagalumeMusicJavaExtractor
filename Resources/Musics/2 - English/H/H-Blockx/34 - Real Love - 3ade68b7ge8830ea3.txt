REAL LOVE

I gotta step back, back to see reality 
remember girls that were my destiny 
those feelings that were always inside of me 
always I thought - BAM - there was reality 

My heart my insight once had a bright light 
forever I thought but I never know 
that that kinda love, onesided and not given back 
would break my heart, yeah and would break my back 

So never again I vowed to the earth and sea 
to trust to rely on girls to set love free 
feel the thing in my heart the way it's been before 
but life was gonna teach me, down in N.Y.C 

So my memories full of fear and agony 
I experienced the way when love is set free 
revealed by both though never said thru words 
but this time love failed 'cause distance sealed it 

Chorus: 
Think about the Real Love! 

So I was back, back in the place 
where I started before not willing to love 
show feelings no more, wrong time, 
wrong place they said to myself, what a disgrace 

'Cause then it happened, emotions continuity 
took it's toll prepared todays reality 
courage and luck on my side and inside of me 
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, it's been to me 

Like a dream I had as a little child 
with a thousand colours totally wild 
bleedin' into one embracing themselves 
brighter and more fluorescent than anything else 

And now I'm back, back in my reality 
looking at my life, my love and feel the 
essence of thruth, ethereal eternity 
I finally found it, God I love reality! 

Chorus 

Real Love is found just once in life
