I HEARD HIM CRY

Feel insanity tonight 
Lost with one long cry 
Try to break the loneliness 
No succesful try 

Heard that cry a thousand times 
Did not see the light 
I didn't know him demanding 
One last fatal try 

Now I understand his lonely cry... 

Chorus: 
I heard him cry 
I heard him cry but I didn't know 
I heard him cry, I heard him cry... 

Missed to say good bye that night, 
Haunted by his cry 
I never knew the reason why 
I guess I just thought of 'I' 

Words were drowned by rain or tears 
Didn't know what he said 
I try to recall the happy years 
These minutes just leave me sad 

Now I understand his lonely cry
