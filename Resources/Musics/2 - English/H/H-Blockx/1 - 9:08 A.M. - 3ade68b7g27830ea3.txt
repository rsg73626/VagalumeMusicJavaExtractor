9:08 A.M.

a lack of sympathy is wath it means to me 
in my eyes tears I've cried 
lived through that tragedy, kissed by the memory 
why.... 

darkness shines so bright 
night is wrapped in sunlight 
uncertainty is the guid 
helplessness will satisfy 
shame turned into pride 
dirt has cleansed virginity 

chorus: 
love's a word of antipathy that's what you mean to me 
cause you're Anna M, Anna M 
you smiled while you were killing me 
smiled while you were selling me 
piece by piece again 

sunlight shines so bright 
the night is wrapped in darkness 
certainty is the guide 
helplessnes unsatisfies 
steadfastness's my pride 
dirt has stained virginity 

chorus 

a lack of sympathy is what is means to me 
why... 
lived through a tragedy kissed by the memory
