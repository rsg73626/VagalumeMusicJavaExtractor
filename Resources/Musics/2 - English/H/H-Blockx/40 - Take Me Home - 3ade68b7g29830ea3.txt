TAKE ME HOME

looking for them streetcafé–Ÿ 
looking for that face, a night after a day 
a day I made love to empty dreams 
and nothing's like what it seems 
nothing's like what it seems to be nomore 

freedom's kissed by loneliness 
somebody take away that emptiness 
I layed on myself and... 

chorus: 
take me home tonight 
take me on my own 
take me all alone 
just come and take me home 
take me home tonight 
take me on my own 
take me all alone 
just come and take me... 
home 

I've seen so many faces I 
I've seen so many nights 
nights without a trace 
so I'm sitting in that streetcaf?
haven't found that face 
the face that makes me say 

freedom's kissed by sweet caress 
nobody took away that emptiness 
that I layed on myself so... 

chorus 

there's so much I felt but I can't explain 
the urge of love remains, but all these easy faces change 
still so much I feel but still I can't explain 
am I the one to blame 
I can't hold a face without a name nomore 
it's up to me to... take me home tonight 

take me home tonight 
take me on my own 
take me all alone 
just come and take me home 

just come and take me home 
just come and take me home 
take me all alone 
just come and take me home
