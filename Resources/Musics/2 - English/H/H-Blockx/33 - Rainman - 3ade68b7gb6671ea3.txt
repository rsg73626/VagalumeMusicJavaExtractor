RAINMAN

Your silence breaks my mind now 
Every chance i see 
Your eyes that look so straight thru 
Thru myself and part of you 

You can't help your feelings 
Hard to keep for yourself 
Your strength has been diminished 
Never knew your psychic health 

You're wrong - not right 
You judge yourself in pain 
Maintain revealing less than what's 
Behind these eyes where there's just rain 

Chorus: 
Rainman 

Sympathetic views restrained 
Till the end of the circle 
Seems to be the only saint 
What life can offer you 

Tomorrow is another day 
You will get up and feel 
The fear that makes your blood run cold 
But you belive it's predestiny 

You're wrong - not right 
You judge yourself in pain 
Maintain revealing less than what's 
Behind these eyes where there's just rain
