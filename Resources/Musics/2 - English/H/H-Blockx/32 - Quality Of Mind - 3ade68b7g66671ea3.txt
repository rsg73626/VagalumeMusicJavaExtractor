QUALITY OF MIND

It's allright, I close my eyes and look at you 
What I see is your smile shining bright at me 

Can you feel it? Yeah 
Can you feel it? Yeah 

When I'm down I shut my mouth and talk to you 
And you smile and close your eyes and look at me 

Can you feel it? Yeah 
Can you feel it? Yeah 

Duality of mind, duality of mind 

It's allright, I shut my mind and die tonight 
And you'll see that I killed duality in mind 

Can you feel it? Yeah 
Can you feel it? Yeah
