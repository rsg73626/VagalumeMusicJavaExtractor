TELL ME WHY

That tuesday night, turned 26 and I caught your smile 
laid down my life, one kiss would take me through the night 
I close my eyes, I feel your touch, I see you smile 
it's on my mind, it's just a dream I know, but why? 

why I just can't stop wondering you're on my mind 

noone tells me why, tell me why 
tell me why you filled that emptiness in me 
tell me why, tell me why, 
tell me why you filled that emptiness in me 
just to tell you goodbye 

a day down the line, reality's back on my mind 
yesterday's behind, the charm of love has died but why 
unsatisfied with what we get used to in this life 
I laid it aside, looks so pale with open eyes 

so I just keep on wondering about what's on my mind 

noone tells me why, tell me why 
why again you filled that emptiness in me 
tell me why, tell me why, 
why again you filled that emptiness in me 
so I tell you goodbye 

tell me why, tell me why, 
tell me why you filled that emptiness in me 
tell me why, tell me why, 
tell me why you filled that emptiness in me 
tell me why, tell me why, 
why again you filled that emptiness in me
