WISH

I wish you could find your little peace of mind 
I wish you would try to overcome your self-denial 
I wish that one day you'll come and make me say 
I swear, I can fly, I will take you to the sky 

yeah, yeah 
what can I do for you my son? 
I'll grant you any wish you want 
what can I do for you my son? 
I'll give you everything I own 

hey 

I'll pick the stars out of the sky 
and make a necklace for your smile 
I'll sail the seas to make you trust in me 
I'll walk from here to eternity 
to become the man you are for be 
I wish you could fly, to take me to the sky 

what can I do for you my son? 
I'll grant you any wish you want 
no need to prove to you my son 
I'll give you anything I own 

what can I do for you my son? 
I'll grant you any wish you want 
what can I do for you my son?
