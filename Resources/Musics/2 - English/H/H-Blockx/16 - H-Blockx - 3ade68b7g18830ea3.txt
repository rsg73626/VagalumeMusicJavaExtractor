H-BLOCKX

Did you see my mother walking round the blocks? 
Did you see them nasty boys looting the lots? 
Did they ever miss you or did they even kiss you? 
Or is the only thing you see Britain's milita? 

If you smell that air 
You can feel the flair 
And the people that rock 
Live in an H-Block 

Chorus: 
H-(H)-B-(B) H-B-L-O-C-K-X - H-BLOCKX 

H-Blockx, that's the name 
We give credit to the people who can feel the pain 
Of aggression, supression and brutality 
Who live in an H-shaped home of insanity 

If you smell that air 
You can feel the flair 
And the people that rock 
Live in an H-Block
