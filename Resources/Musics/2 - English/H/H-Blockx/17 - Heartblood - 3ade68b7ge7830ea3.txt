HEARTBLOOD

I hope our love lasts, passed our lifetime 
although some times, I know we went astray 
they say all ways will seperate some day 
so let them say, but hell that's not our way 

and all I know, and all I know, I know my love's so deep 
and all I know, and all I know, you showed a love that's so deep 

I feel our hearts bleed into one, bleed into one 

damn well I know, there won't be a pair to find 
never two of a kind, with just one single mind 
but who's to blame, and for whoever cares 
our lives too short, our love's forever, yeah 

cause all I know, yes, all I know, I know my love roots so deep 
cause all I know, yes, all I know, you showed me love that's so deep 

I feel our hearts bleed into one, feel our hearts bleed into, 
I feel our hearts bleed into one, bleed into one 

all I wanna feel 
all I wanna feel, all I wanna feel, all I wanna feel, all I wanna feel.... 

cause all I know, yes, all I know, I know my love roots so deep 
cause all I know, yes, all I know, you showed me love that's so deep 

I feel our hearts bleed into one, feel our hearts bleed into,
