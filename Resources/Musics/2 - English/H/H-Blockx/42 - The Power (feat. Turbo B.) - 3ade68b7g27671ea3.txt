THE POWER (FEAT. TURBO B.)

From the crack of the whip I attack,
front to back in this thing called rap.
Diggi dig it like shovel rhyme devil on a heavenly level
bang the bass. Turn up the treble.
Radical mind day and night all the time
7 - 14 wise devine.
Maniac brainiac winning the game,
IÂ´m the lyrical Jesse James

Ohhuohoh....

Ref.:
IÂ´ve got the power

Quality I possess some say IÂ´m fresh
when my voice goes through the rest of the
mi-crophone that I am holding,
copywritten lyrics so they canÂ´t be stolen,
if they are H-blockx donÂ´t need the police
so try to save them your voice will sink
so please stay off my back
or I will attack and you donÂ´t want that

Ohhuohoh...

Ref.:
IÂ´ve got the power 

Like a demon IÂ´m steaming like a crook IÂ´m fiending
tell the opposition color whip creaming
shredding skim with the lyrics rhyme breaking the bone
through your soul with the tone of my microphone.
In this game of life I will try to survive
and take your time you bring us all nose jive.
SupermanÂ´s strong even in my last hour
