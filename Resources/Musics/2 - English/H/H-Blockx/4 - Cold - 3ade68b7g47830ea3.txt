COLD

Mary gets up at six in the morning 
she runs herself a bath while she's brushing her teeth 
six thirty she's styled and dressed 
in the kind of rag she layed out before she went to sleep 
noone's there but a cup full of coffee 
bored she stares at the morning news 

she's feeling cold 
feeling cold 
she's feeling cold 
Mary's feeling cold 

Mary files the papers for the boss 
of Smith & Watson's data company, yeah 
from nine to five she's doing the duties, uh 
trivial matters, fulfilled with dignity 
seven/eleven Mary lays out a dress for another day 
ten pm back to bed in a warm and cosy way 

but Mary's feeling cold 
she's feeling cold 
feeling cold 
she's feeling cold 

well 

she's feeling cold 
feeling cold 
Mary's feeling cold 
she's feeling cold
