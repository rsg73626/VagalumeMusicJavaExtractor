HOW DO YOU FEEL?

I don't know what to say, I'm crying everyday 
I'm talking to you slowly, but you don't know what I mean 
Get down with reality, here's my resume 
You never ever knew me cause you never loved me 

I-I-I I'm looking for renewal 
I-I-I won't forget about you 
I-I-I many girls are on my mind 
But the only problem is 
That you're on my mind too 

Tell me how you feel about us, 
Don't you remember yesterday? 

Chorus: 
How do you feel, how do you feel, 
How do you feel, how do you feel... 

I don't know what to do, there's no one else but you 
I know that I'm in love but I don't know about you 
I'm messed up in my world, reality is blurred 
I don't know how you feel, 
That's why I'm messed up in this world 

I-I-I I'm looking for renewal 
I-I-I won't forget about you 
I-I-I many girls are on my mind 
But the only problem is 
That you're on my mind too 

Tell me how you feel about us, 
Don't you remember yesterday? 

Chorus: 
How do you feel, how do you feel, 
How do you feel, how do you feel... 

Tell me how you feel about us, 
Don't you remember yesterday? 

I'm not scared of your tomorrow, 
(how do you feel?) 
I just think about today 
(how do you feel?) 
I'm not crying out for yesterday 
(how do you feel?) 
Just tell me now exactly how you feel... 

Chorus: 
How do you feel, how do you feel,
