STARS

sunny days in a winter world 
scatter deception in her eyes 
a glimmer of white has fallen 
on her smile now she cries, 
a sunny world has died these days 

now I know, she longs for the days she now denies 

chorus: 
she has fallen from the stars 
and I don't know what it was 
the sugar bowl snowed in her tomorrow 
yes, she calls upon the stars 
on her way of broken glass 
to take away that bowl of sorrow 
that bowl of sorrow 

yesterday's fading grey, 
she forgot the kid she used to be 
the pallor white she seeks for day by day, 
I forgot the kid she used to be 

now I know, she longs for the days she now denies 

chorus 

now I know, she longs for the days she now denies
