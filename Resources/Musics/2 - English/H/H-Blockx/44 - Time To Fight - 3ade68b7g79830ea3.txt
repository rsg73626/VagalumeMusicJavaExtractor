TIME TO FIGHT

My name is MC-H on an H-Blockx mission 
We're playing a song about nuclear fission 
An instrument of war and a source of energy 
People do not see that it's our enemy 
The people in Iran and Mr. Bush and the states 
Is what Saddam in Iraq just hates 
So stand up everybody 
Come stand up for your rights 
I'm telling you the truth it's time to fight 

Chorus: 
T-I-M-E T-O (time to) 
F-I-G-H-T (fight) 
TIME TO FIGHT 

The nuky weapon in the hand of the wrong dude 
Can cause the people in the world a bitter pain 
Tshernobyl and Harrisbug is what people have seen 
Sadly only broadcast on the TV-screen 
Because if all mankind knew what this was all about 
They would gather all together to cry and shout 
So stand up everybody 
Come stand up for your rights 
I'm telling you the truth it's time to fight 

Chorus 

It has got to be the duty of all men 
To protect us from desatsters as good as they can 
This is to all political leaders all over the world 
To make us that nature isn't hurt 
I know we need that shit to keep us warm 
But the fact that this risk can do us harm 
Makes me think that it's time to pray 
To let God find us anotherway
