STEP BACK

Hey yo! This is Dee Bullit from Da P-Pack Posse 
Yo, Some motherfuckers tryin' to sweat my homies from the H-Blockx 
But we ain't going out like that, yo, ya listen up real good 

H-Blockx rollin with Da P-Pack 

Once again - c'mon - here it is gee, 
I'm gonna get things straight you better hear me, 
All ya slingers and fiends of ours lookin for trouble 
Ya better gitcha ass out on the double 

Cuz I'll wake and take ya, shake and bake ya, 
Come and forsake ya to try to make ya, 
Understand the plan that is programmed, 
Because you find yourself in our promised land 

God damned, fools, ya best back up 
All you grudging suckers who try to crack up 
What we got and what we came to achieve, 
Hey yo ya better leave 

Chorus: 
Step back - yo ya suckers better get off my back - step back 
Step back - go on - ya better get packed - step back (3x) 
H-Blockx rollin with Da P-Pack 

Ya carry your head too far above your shoulders, 
The longer ya fuss man, my blood runs colder 
Older and older and older I get, 
Cause of the news and the fucked up little lies you spread 

Get packed - MOVE - ya better step back, 
If you just envy what I have, I'll share the stack, 
Just refrain from the pain that you bring me, 
You wanna know all about me just ring me 

To hell with all the prejudice about me, 
If ya only fuss and discuss me ya really disgust me, 
ya know, one thing's gotta be understood, 
I'm a bad motherfucker, gonna wish you would... 

Chorus
