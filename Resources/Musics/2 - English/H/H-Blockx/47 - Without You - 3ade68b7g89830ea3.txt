WITHOUT YOU

sometimes - times I can't think cause your face it lies 
it lies in my eyes 
nor can I stand one day again when we're lost in lies 
no lives can breathe no air at a time 
when noone's fine 
yes, I'm afraid, yes, I'm afraid, I'm afraid I was too late 

can't hear the leaves of the spring 
can't feel no warmth in me 
can't smell the scent of the summer 

cause without you 
whohowow 
without you 

tonights a night I can't feel no warmth 
no warmth in my blood 
I can't dream a dream nor can I scream 
I see your eyes cry 
and I see your pic all night long - noone's strong 
to promise one the sky but we all - all we wish to fly 

can't hear the leaves of the spring 
can't feel no warmth in me 
can't smell the scent of the summer 

cause without you 
whohowow 
without you 
(without you) 
cause without you 
whohowow 
without you 
(without you)
