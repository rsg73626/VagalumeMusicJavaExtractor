FLY

alienated lying there with myself 
myself is someone else 
there's noone handcuffed in the place on that day 
redo the day or die 
that's all I think of 'but' for no lies I will deny 
that I hate myself - that I hate myself 
for all the blackened days that came with myself 
caught ourselves 
and I can't deny that I feel I'll die, that I feel I'll die 

if I can't - if I can't 
if I can't - if I can't 

fly - fly (if I can't) fly - fly (away) 
fly - fly (if I can't) fly - fly (away) 

failures of the old unforgiven I am 
I am told by myself 
noone else fights to fall asleep 
so deep the wound I broke so deep 
the cut it stings 
it stings 
I suffer in silence for my mistakes 
please cut me lose from my own stake 

so I can - so I can 
so I can - so I can 

fly - fly (so I can) fly - fly (away) 
fly - fly (if I can't) fly - fly (away) 

(fly) 

FLY!! 

fly - fly (if I can't) fly - fly (away) 
fly - fly (so I can) fly - fly (away)
