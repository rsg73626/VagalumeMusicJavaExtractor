DISCOVER MY SOUL

Look out for a better world - lost in time 
Look out for a better world - lost my mind 
Look out for a better world - look inside 
Look out for a better world - take what's mine 

Look out for a better world - see the light 
Look out for a better world - shining bright 

Coming out of nowhere coming out of me 

Chorus: 
This is the way to discover my soul, yeah 
This is the way to discover my soul 

Look out for a better world - meeting me 
Look out for a better world - feeling free 
Look out for a better world - make me see 
Look out for a better world - all of me 

Look out for a better world - see the light 
Look out for a better world - shining bright 

Coming out of nowhere coming out of me
