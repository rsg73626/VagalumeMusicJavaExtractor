GIMME MORE

Twenty four seven and a three sixty five 
I am in full effect and I ain't taking no jive 
I got the masterplan cause I'm desaster man 
And I live by the 'gets' not by the 'gives' cause I can't 

Damn, you can't give you always take, take, take 
Take and break and that is wrong wait 
Wrong for God's sake, too much, wake up 
You got it going on 
Too long for you, for me to take and just stake... 

Kindness, friendship, all the people offer? 
All the understandings you would say but I want more 

More, more, more but what is more on your score? 
If you get a whole lot but everything is a bore 
Cause what you get is not at all 
All you thought it'd be 
Dissapointed my man, hell - well 1-2-3 
Now quit it kid and try the 'gives' not the 'gets' 

But I want this I want that, gimme more I'm upset 

I just can't take you no more 

Chorus: 
Gimme more, gimme more, - ah gimme more - 
What are you waiting for, just gimme, gimme more 

So you want this and that hey what's your best bet 

Well I don't know for sure, but I sure need it fast 
Guess I just need a grip on your private notions 

Hell, that is none of your biz and that's a shitty motion 
What you don't care don't need no understanding 
Just demanding, just demanding 

Your life and love's don't give me if's and but 
Cause if I give I lose, I can't afford no cuts 

But I'm not yours, no, not at all 
You can't just take me out 
I ain't no shopping mall 
I gotta - 

Get in return a bit from me to learn? 
What? What I'm all about, no that is my turn 
Earn and get as much as I can 

But what's it good for if then you don't get a friend? 
Guess you're too fucked up in the head 
So you just ignore 
That you got none and want more 
But all you know is gimme more 

I just can't take you no more...
