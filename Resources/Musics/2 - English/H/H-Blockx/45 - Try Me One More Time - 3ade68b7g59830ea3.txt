TRY ME ONE MORE TIME

I took away your reality 
I took away all your memories 
I gave up all the bliss that was made for you 

And now I'm sad cause I missed the time 
And now I'm sad cause my words were dying 
Now that I'm grown and alone 
I see my own silent crime 

Tonight I drown in pain and beg you please 
Just try me one more time 

Chorus: 
Try me one more time 

It takes a mile or a miracle 
It takes some tears just for me to tell 
It takes a year and fear 
To open up my soul for you 

With you I'm blessed and you are divine 
You turned my life from water to wine 
You wame my sleep, are my sun to me 
That I need to shine 

So I regret, will nnot forget what I did 
So try me one more time 

Chorus: 

Can't tell you why I could do it 
Can't tell you why I should face it 
Can't tell you why I could lose it 
Can't tell you why you should try it 
Why - why - why - just can't tell you why 
But please, but please, but please, but please...
