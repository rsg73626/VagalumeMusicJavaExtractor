DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO

I-I know it's time to realize, 
I-I know the love you felt for me has died, 
I-I try to cope with the pain inside 
but I just realize that I cannot hide the feelings that I have inside... 

Can you hear me? 

I-I know it's hard to understand, 
but girl you gotta know, 
you made me be a different man, 
I-I don't want you to feel no guilt inside, 
I just want to stay friend but I feel the fear girl that I never can 

Chorus: 
You gotta do what you wanna do,[hear me] 
still remember what I feel for you,[hear me] 
you gotta do what you wanna do,[hear me] 
still remember that I care for you,[hear me] 

I don't want to see our friendship die, 
I know we need to seperate ways, 
but I don't know why 
I hope someday we both will see, 
that girl our friendship was created for eternity
