THIS IS NOT AMERICA

No pain no gain is the flame in your brain 
And I can't tell you 'you can't do it' 
You will taste the pain 
You gotta be tough and rough like any superstar 
That you see on TV and what is called a gangsta 

Hah, hah, hah, you really think you could be 
Just with the hat on your head and a fist like an O.G. 
Mad it is you know to think you are 
Hardcore as the guys in L.A. are 

Well, my pal, you don't need all that hardcore 
Yo motherfucker, you know what's your fist for 
To put a brick upon a brick now won't you quit 
Yet to give me that bullshit cause this is not america 
Don't give me that bullshit cause this is not america 

Chorus: 
This is not - ah this is not 
This is not - this is not america 

There's people getting sprayed with the bullet of pain 
By the media the guns and you're the aim 
Again 'n' again 'n' again 'n' again 
An american media don't make a man 

Of all you soft ice wanna T's - ah who you wanna be? 
Be an invidual; show personality 
Take all it takes to be somebody else 
And don't belive all of what the hype tells 

Cause if you're down with yourself, and if you're down with your soul 
- Ah, you will quick understand what this was for 
Don't think you gotta be like the 'homies' are 
Cause all you want is bliss and this is not america 
Cause all you want is bliss and this is not america
