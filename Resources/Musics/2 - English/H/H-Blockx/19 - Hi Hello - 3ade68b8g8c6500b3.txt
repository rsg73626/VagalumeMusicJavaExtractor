HI HELLO

You know I got it, you know I care
In every sense of the matter we look and stare
If you have got it, just let it be
Pick up you're ready to find just what you need
If you don't know me I just say hello
And everybody is ready to just let go
You hear me calling, ready to fall
So just a moment we're ready to give it all
This is call out, a call out for you
I wonder how you're doing at all
A call out, a call out for you
I wonder how you're doing at all

So hi, hello, how are you doing?
Hi, hello, how are you doing?
Hi, hello, know what you're doing
When you say what you need and see what I see, I know

You say many, you say too much
So cop the trunk and dance before we talk
If I say ?don't even try
Let's get acquainted, get ready to sympathize
You don't know me, but you say hi
Our many friends so these parties are?the side
Just introduce yourself right now
And everybody is welcome, no matter how
This is call out, a call out for you
I wonder how you're doing at all
A call out, a call out for you
I wonder how you're doing at all

So hi, hello, how are you doing?
Hi, hello, how are you doing?
Hi, hello, know what you're doing
When you say what you need and see what I see, I know X 2
