GO FREAKY

No matter where we are and no matter where we go 
It's our style our line and our music that we show 
Just listen to the beat and a little later you will know 
It's really freaky funky stuff and honest too 
Forget the shit that you hear and you see 
Every night and day on your color TV 
Just listen to peppers pray across the land 
They're really freaky funky and no beat box band 

Chorus: 
Go freaky - in the world we're livin' 
Go freaky - 'cause funk does begin 
Go freaky - in the world we're livin' 
Go what - go freaky! 

No matter where we are and no matter where we go 
It's our style our line and our music that we show 
One of our dreams so it seems is to support a pepper show 
Only meet these guys and let the people know 
That they're the best of the west and harder than the rest 
smooth you might think and honest we know 
Now listen to the beat 'cause Mason's gonna go
