CAN'T BREAK MY FEAR

get out of me wanting to be 
stronger than me you are not me 
cause I feel and I fear whatever it is 
it can't be what's me 
drills out a hole inside my soul 
fills out the hole I want you to go 
I hear you, I fear you, you're in me 

caught in myself like nothing else 
deep in my cells you ring the bells 
what I feel's as cold as steel whatever it is 
it's my achilles heel 

can't break my fear 

I go out to drink don't have to think 
can't find a link, feel like a sink 
just to feel none is real whatever helps 
to wash the pain away 

starting to doubt what I'm about 
inside a cloud can't bleed you out 
I see you, I fear you, you're not me 

hang on so long, until you're gone 
I know you're strong and that you're wrong 
but I feel and I fear whoever you are 
you cut the deepest scar 

can't break my fear 

cause I am scared! I am scared! I am scared! 
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am... scared!!!
