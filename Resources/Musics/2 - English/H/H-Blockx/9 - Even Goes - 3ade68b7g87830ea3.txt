EVEN GOES

waking up late, it seems a little like always 
day is gray and nothing's right - psyche 
I close my eyes - I see the river runs blood red 
and the hourglass is dripping on the wrong side, 
I'm tripping on the wrong side - right 

going blind 

even goes and it shows it's just a fraction of it all 
even goes and I know that time will break my fall 

getting up tired, and nothing's like always 
making my day - I'm going blind - psyche 
memories blurred yet I wanna start all new 
and I try to take a walk here on right side 
I'm walking on the bright side - right 

going blind 

even goes and it shows it's just a fraction of it all 
even goes and I know that time will break my fall 

even goes 

even goes 

even goes and it shows it's just a fraction of it all
