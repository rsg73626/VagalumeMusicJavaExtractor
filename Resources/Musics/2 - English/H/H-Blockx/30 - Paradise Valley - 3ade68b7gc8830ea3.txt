PARADISE VALLEY

can't think straight my mind is covered with clouds 
no doubt what I'm talking about; 
I've never seen a place like this I miss no bliss 
how could I ever forget how it feels, how it heals, 
my wound, my blood, whatever pain my soul has got 
these waters so clear 
near and far all I can hear 
rustle of leaves and insects hummin on trees 

no place like this - no place like this 
paradise valley 

the sun reflects some billion glitters of water 
direct in my face but I can't take my eyes of this place 
so peaceful, beautiful, it flows all into one 
meadows, mountains, I, the sky 
so close I can never feel to gods own miracle 
and then I see, I see that eagle fly 

no place like this - no place like this
