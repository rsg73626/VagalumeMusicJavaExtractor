GOTTA FIND A WAY

Why do I panic? This shit is manic 
I got it going on and I don't know where it's coming from 
I feel no strenght in, I have no trust in 
Myself or anything I liked that's gone so long 

Might be a timeshock - that I took 
Might be my love - love that I locked 
Might be my heart - hard as a rock 
All I know I never knew this lifehook 

Damn this is tragic, where is the magic 
Where's all the glitter, gleam those things 
I dream my selfesteem 

Chorus: 
I've got to, got to, got to 
I've got to find a way 

Guess I am static, full automatic 
There is this fear for me to take and pull it all inside 

How can I - break my prison? 
How can I - get a vision? 
How can I - find some wisdom? 
All I know I need a fast desiscion 

Damn can I try it, I don't deny it 
From dark to dawn from dawn to light your brown eyes turned life bright
