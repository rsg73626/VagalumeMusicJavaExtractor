I CAN'T RELY ON YOU

I'm feeling my mind is 
Blowing me out of place right now 
I cannot deny it 
So I won't and I keep defying 

Those lies you toss, your fake love's a loss 
Is why I can't rely and have no trust 
In you - yes, it's true, I'm thru with you 
Cause if I look back this ain't straight out of the blue 

Hah - you don't have a clue - but - what's up 
With all of these times when you never stood by me 
You never been with me, you never said once at all that you'd miss me 

I can't deny it's true - I can't rely on you 

Chorus: 
Don't have no faith no more in you 
I CAN'T RELY ON YOU 
Can't walk a mile no more with you 
I CAN'T RELY ON YOU 
You're full of lies and nothing's true 
I CAN'T RELY ON YOU 
I know it's tough but true - I can't rely on you 

I wonder have you once 
Tried to walk the way I thought we could 
Selfrighteous, all you stress 
What was right, what was wrong, let me guess 

The thing was never born guess 
I've been ripped and torn 
Just to please your life but now I feel scorn 
You fool - what do you think I am? - a tool? 
I sure will forget your name 

Cool, 'cause I can't stand or understand 
Just how much for your sake, 
Just how much I could take 
When you were trying to break, 
When you were trying to fake 
The whole world I tried to save but now I just hate
