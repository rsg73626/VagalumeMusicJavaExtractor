BLACK SKIES

you're sowing the seeds of hate on fields of peace 
curb your vicinity with vanity 
you're proud on each and everyone fallen to your charm, 
you're proud if all you bring is bitter harm 
you're proud on your filthy evil me, 
your personality is kissed by jealousy 
your hunger stilled when you have killed 
other's dreams to be fulfilled, 
the night drapes the skies in sweet release 

chorus: 
black skies, your eyes, 
the night reveals and heals all the pain inside 
your black skies on my mind 

a stiff body sluggishly on the floor 
drives me insane cause I expected more 
with every minute greed grows in me 
and all these silent voices keep tempting me 
from lust to dust, from day to dawn 
filthy soil I smell the lawn 
I long for the night dressed in sweet release 

chorus 

another day has died, black the sky, 
I licked off the dirt, now it's washed and dried, 
after all this pain you're so far away 

chorus 

(sweet child o'mine)
