RISIN' HIGH

It´s a loffer, poffer ding dong, bigger than King Kongs,
without a doubt, that ain´t nothing to discuss about
when I see you, my friend you take it in your hand
do you like it like I always like it, like it, like it, like it too?
when you hold it nice and tight I think the time is right
to quick make up your mind that you´ll be with me tonight

Chorus:
Risin´ High, risin´ high, let your will fly high!(x3)
Risin´ High, risin´ high oh let your stick fly high

ah, when you´re shaking in your room how to meet this girl real soon
you´d like to think of silly willy how you´d like to do the willy killy
smooth you choose to let your emos run lose but the lose girl is gone with her clothes still on
man it ain´t no thing but a chicken wing cause when I bust you out you will scream and shout

Chorus

Cause I´m living for my loffer, I´m living for my poffer
I´m living for my ding dong I´m living for my King Kong
Say what, girlie hot I wanna bust your spot
you say no, no way, you gotta stop and say
hey stud crack my nut with your lickory stick
rise it high, make me fly cause your my magic guy
That´s why I´m living for my loffer, I´m living for my poffer
I´m living for my ding dong I´m living for my King Kong
loffer di, poffer di, loffer di, poffer di, loffer di, poffer di, ding dong

It´s a loffer, poffer ding dong, bigger than King Kongs,
without a doubt, that ain´t nothing to discuss about
and now you hold it nice and tight and now the time is right
cause you made up your mind that you´ll be with me tonight

Chorus
