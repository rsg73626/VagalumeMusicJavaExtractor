OH HELL YEAH

People think they know me,
Say I'm wound a little tight,
Tell me I go looking for trouble,
That I'm always ready for a fight;
But, I'm just an easy-going guy,
Not crossing any line,
I'm a caring individual,
Most all the time,
Most all the time...
Quite alot of the time,
Its just that,
Its just that!
ITS JUST THAT!!
OH HELL YEAH!

Sometimes I drink a little beer!
Sometimes I make a little mess!
Sometimes I get a little angry!
Sometimes I kick a little ass!

Whoah...!
You know..?
Sometimes...
I kick a LOT of ass,
Oh-hell yeah!

Some people seem unhappy,
With certain things I say,
They seem to think Iâ€™m impolite,
That Iâ€™m cultured in some way.
But Iâ€™m just an easy-going guy,
And I appreciate their advice,
I believe in self-improvement,
And always being nice,
Well...
Sometimes being nice,
Occasionally;
Its just that,
Oh-hell yeah!

Sometimes I drink a little beer!
Sometimes I make a little mess!
Sometimes I get a little angry!
Sometimes I kick a little ass!

Whoa!
You know?
Sometimes I kick a lot of ass,
Whoa!
You know..?
Oh Hell Yeah!
Oh Hell Yeah!
Oh Hell Yeah!
Oh Hell Yeah!
Oh Hell Yeah!

Oh yeah!
Sometimes I drink a little beer!
Sometimes I make a little mess!
Sometimes I get a little angry!
Sometimes I kick a little ass!
Whoa!
You know!

Sometimes I kick a lot of ass,
Whoaaa!
You know!
Oh Hell Yeah

Sometimes I drink a little beer!
Sometimes I make a little mess!
Sometimes I get a little angry!
Sometimes I kick a little ass!

Whoaaa!
You know!
Sometimes I kick a lot of ass,
Whoa!
You know!
Oh yeah!?
Oh yeah!
Sometimes I kick a lot of ass!...
