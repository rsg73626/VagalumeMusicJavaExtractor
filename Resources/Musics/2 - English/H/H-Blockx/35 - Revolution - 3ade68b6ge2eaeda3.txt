REVOLUTION

You make me lose my mind
make me forget what's right
you make me lose
everything

you make me lose my soul
you make me lose

for me to plant a plant of a

that I need to show you that that ain't
right and it's our plight to fight for the
rights of the weak that's why we need
this Re-vo-lu-tion

Chorus
