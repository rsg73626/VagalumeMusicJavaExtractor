JUDGE OF THE DEATH

JUDGE OF THE DEATH

I am the judge of the death
Blinding your conscience
Asserting your final sentence
Forbidding your life sequence

Singing a song of silence
I will see your decadence
Carrying your soul consequent
To you pay your penitence

I judge
You regard
I rule
You shut up
