LAUGHIN AT TOMORROW

Listen!
They all keeps telling
Man, I think I'm giving in
I guess that's what we are!
And since they're headed here
We can't go anywhere
It's been a long time apart!

Bring me one of those. What are you having?
A bottle blue of cold
What's the chance that in twenty years or so
We're laughing at tomorrow!

I guess it's in us
To break our bones and fall apart!
I guess it's in us
To make amends and wake-ups call
While laughing at tomorrow

We all keep dreaming things
Forgetting and forgiving
And in the beauty of the beast
Let me propose a toast
To what we want the most
Let's celebrate the endless nights

With every words you say, getting older
With every friends who stays
Getting closer
In sixty years or so we're laughing at tomorrow

I guess it's in us
To break our bones and fall apart!
I guess it's in us
To make amends and wake-ups call
While laughing at tomorrow
