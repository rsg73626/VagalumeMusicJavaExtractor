THE ONE AND ONLY

Hey...
there's something I gotta tell you
It's hard to say it but I need you to know
I'ts time to write a new kind of story
I try to explain the reason and why I have to go
 
Cause there's a time for love
A time for change
A time to mend a
But I can't pretend
Cause I wanna be
The one and only
 
I guess we all need time
I guess we all need space
I guess I needed mine
The one and only one
I guess we live to find
Where to draw the line
of the life we leave behind
 
Cause I wanna be, Yeah I
I'm gonna be the one and only
 
Hey...
Somewhere in the distance
I know you might find someone somewhere to go
I don't know cause my head keeps spinning
I'm reaching for a new begining
Finally it's plain to see.
