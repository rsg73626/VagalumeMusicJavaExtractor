EYE FOR AN EYE

There must be something in the water
I keep on messing it up
And then I act like a model
And fill my head full of taunts

(Attention, attention, attention)
(Attention, attention)

I try to be good, I try to be better
I keep on dancing with the devil inside
I try to be good, been trying for ever
It's time to leave my life, leave for some time

(It's time to wake up!) I'm the enemy
(It's time to shake up) Oh, yeah
(It's time to wake up!) Cause it's the enemy in me
I have an enemy in me

I keep on rollin' with the punches
I try to walk a straight line
But after all is said and done
I'm still a prisoner of my own restrain

(Attention, attention, attention)
(Listen up!)
(Attention, attention)

I try to be good, I try to be better
I keep on dancing with the devil inside
I try to be good, been trying for ever
It's time to leave my life, leave for some time

(It's time to wake up!) I'm the enemy
(It's time to shake up) Oh, yeah
(It's time to wake up!) Cause it's the enemy in me
I have an enemy in me

(Attention, attention, attention)
(Yeah!)
(Attention, attention)

I try to be good, I try to be better
I keep on dancing with the devil inside
I try to be good, been trying for ever
It's time to leave my life, leave for some time

(It's time to wake up!) I'm the enemy
(It's time to shake up) Oh, yeah
(It's time to wake up!) Cause it's the enemy in me
I have an enemy in me
