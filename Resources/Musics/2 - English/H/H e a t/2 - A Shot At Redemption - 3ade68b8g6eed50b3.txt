A SHOT AT REDEMPTION

I've been hiding for far too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song
I've been tryin' to hard, too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song

Yeah, yeah! Oh

Looks like obscene what one has done
Has turned another man to a rolling stone
I been strucked out, lying on the crowd
With the bitter taste of lovin' in my mouth

I've been hiding for far too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song
I've been tryin' to hard, too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song

And the worst pros and cons
Knowing what I do can never be undone
Lord, have mercy on the souls
And my retaliation strike is about to fall

I've been hiding for far too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song
I've been tryin' to hard, too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song

When you fight for freedom
There's no tomorrow
It's time for you
To pay for your crime

I've been hiding for far too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song
I've been tryin' to hard, too long
Seems like forever been singin' on this song
