MANNEQUIN SHOW

You think you know me, my game
Yeah, you told me you don't believe in fairytales
I should've known you, you fool
I'll break the doubting voice inside of me

I bet you wanna say no but I wanna know it
I bet you wanna be all the things I'm gonna be

Time to believe all the things that you see
Quit holding me back despite the way that you feel
Fall further and fight my inner faith
By the power bestowed from this mannequin show

I'd like to see myself as a wise man
In my perspective it's sex and the only broken dream
Of one thing I am certain
I will never return to what I am and learn

I bet you wanna say no but I wanna know it
I bet you wanna be all the things I'm gonna be

Time to believe all the things that you see
Quit holding me back despite the way that you feel
Fall further and fight my inner faith
By the power bestowed from this mannequin show

Time to believe all the things that you see
Despite the way that you feel
Time to believe all the things that you see
In this mannequin show

Time to believe all the things that you see
Quit holding me back despite the way that you feel
Fall further and fight my inner faith
By the power bestowed from this mannequin show
