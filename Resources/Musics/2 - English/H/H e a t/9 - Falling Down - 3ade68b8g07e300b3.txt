FALLING DOWN

You'll never trust in anyone
You lock your door and life goes on
Love is just a memory
Far from how it all should be
 
Cause I know what you're looking for
It's a small step out of the door
To a road less travelled for sure
 
Cuz I will keep you from falling down
I will be there when you hit the ground
I will never let you down
I promise to stay
I promise to keep you from falling down
 
I know how it feels inside
To walk around with distant eyes
If I believed in broken dreams
They'd never taken you to me
 
I'm the one you're looking for
It's a small step out of the door
To a road less travelled for sure
 
Cuz I will keep you from falling down
I will be there when you hit the ground
I will never let you down
I promise to stay
I promise to keep you from falling down
 
Won't you come a little closer
Cause baby I will be there
 
I will keep you from falling down..
