BETTER OFF ALONE

You're better off alone
Than with the world in your hands
You know it's all up to you
I am beggining for the truth
Is it so hard to understand
 
It's a long wait and see
When you're down on your kness
So good-bye say farewell
Cause I know
 
I'ts time to find another way
I know
It's time to turn the page again
You're better off alone
 
When push comes to shove
We better face the facts
That we can't carry on and lose our track
In a place where we don't belong
 
It's a long wait and see
When you're down on your kness
So good-bye say farewell
Cause I know
