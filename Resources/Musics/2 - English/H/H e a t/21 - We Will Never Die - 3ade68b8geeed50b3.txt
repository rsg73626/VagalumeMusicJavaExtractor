WE WILL NEVER DIE

She came out of nowhere, like a candle in the night
I'll always remember it, as a love at first sight
The way she was dressed was nothing in particular
But I almost knew that she was all that I wanted

Was searching for someone (someone like you)
To live and to love and to fight for

We will never die, stronger than ever
As we won't back down
We will never die, we'll be young for ever
As the years may pass by, we will never die

The times are a-changing, all the struggles we're gonna fool
Put all our arms to the test, but my face says something new
I find myself thinking we're far from indestructible
But now here we stand, some will ride, some will fall

Don't let the sunset, (hold on together)
You get what you've got and you've got enough

We will never die, stronger than ever
As we won't back down
We will never die, we'll be young for ever
As the years may pass by, we will never die
