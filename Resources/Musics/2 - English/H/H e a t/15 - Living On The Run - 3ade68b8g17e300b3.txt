LIVING ON THE RUN

I've been meaning to tell you
I've been trying to tell you for so long
Didn't know how to face you
To cut this off
 
Was it consideration
Or showing signs of a weakness on my part
Was I hoping you'd finally
Hear my heart
 
Am I patient for nothing
Can't you show me a little sympathy
Tell me something is coming please
 
Juast a word from you
To hold onto
Before the night is gone
Can't you see  we're living on the run
Baby close your eyes and realize
Before it comes undone
Can't you see we're living on the run
 
In bed with a stranger
That's how it feels in your bed again
No you are not sleeping baby
Don't pretend
 
Now it seems like I'm screeming
Crying out but I cannot hear a sound
Like the sand in the hourglass
I am running out
 
Am I patient for nothing...
 
Why are we wasting all this time
Who needs another empty night
 
Just a word from you...
