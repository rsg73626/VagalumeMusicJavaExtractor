DOWNTOWN

Meet sir tommy brown
He's the governor of downtown
The law of every street
The city centers heartbeat
A friend is family
But they all have a different need
The vein that turns to gold
From the rush that tommy sold
 
It goes down on and ond on
Everyone sings that song
That slowly fades away
Making all the color turn to different shades of grey
 
Sing...
 
Meet detective tate
He's the law of the entire state
Feared by everyone
He writes your do's and dont's
''to serve and protect''
Has a very wak effect
When detectives glady take
The money tommy plays
 
It goes down on and ond on
Everyone sings that song
That slowly fades away
Making all the color turn to different shades of grey
 
Sing...
 
It goes down on and ond on
Everyone sings that song
That slowly fades away
Making all the color turn to different shades of grey
 
Sing...
