ALL THE NIGHTS

Waking up, falling back into your arms
You're not really here at all only in my mind!
Take away, take this heartache out of me
Like a ghost I cannot see, keeping hope alive

When I hear you
And you say yeah
And I reach
There's not anybody out there!

All of these nights are lies
I have you back
But I know that come the light
I'll open up my eyes
And I'll realize
Only dreams are keeping this love alive
Yeah, all the nights are lies

Don't believe the paper on the early train
It's another day again, living without you
Wasn't it only precious hours ago?
You were mine to love and hold, keeps me all confused

When I hear you
And you say yeah
And I reach
Is there anybody out there?

All of these nights are lies
I have you back
But I know that come the light
I'll open up my eyes
And I'll realize
Only dreams are keeping this love alive
Yeah, all the nights are lies

All the nights are lies
Keeping hope alive
Another day goes by
You know I can't take it no more

All of these nights are lies
I have you back
But I know that come the light
I'll open up my eyes
And I'll realize
Only dreams are keeping this love alive
Yeah, all the nights are lies
All the nights are lies
