IN AND OUT OF TROUBLE

Even though some things will never change
with or without you
I've broken every promise every chain
I have ever been tied to
 
Just another failure in my life
(I gotta fight just to stay alive)
Just another hole to fill inside
 
Somewhere on the way I just got lost
I guess when I lost you
Can't stay between the lines that I have crossed
 
Who will be my accident tonight?
(I gotta fight just to stay alive)
I'm just another memory
 
Running In and out of trouble
Going down going under yeah!
Running in and out of trouble
Hit me hard make it double yeah!
 
Waking up the fire in my mind
with or without you
Wonder how you took it all this time
now you no longer have to
 
Who will be my accident tonight?...
 
Running...
 
Running in and out of trouble hit me hard make it double
Running in and out of trouble for the rest of my life
Running in and out trouble - Hit me hard make it double
 
I'm just a another memory
Running...
