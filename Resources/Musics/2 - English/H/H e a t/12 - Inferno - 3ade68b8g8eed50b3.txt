INFERNO

I am a freak in this masquerade
I'm out to drink and masturbate
Been holding back what's inside of me
All the shadows keep all your sanity

Another side kicked in, who do you think I am?
That's not for me
I'm born to run and I don't even give a shit
But you will never see what I am, see what I am!

UU, I'm a rebel in the dark. I said
UU, and this is how, this is how I'm born

What got in me? Strength to shout a name
And slicy feet, it's a luxury
Another part of me's still in ecstasy
I am just a creep burning down a keg

I'm not quite sure when you look at me the way you do
Who the fuck are you?
I will destroy everyone who gets in my way
I will tear you apart! You're gone, sh, when I'm gone

UU, I'm a rebel in the dark. I said
UU, and this is how, this is how I'm born
UU, I'm not a devil, not a god
UU, I'm just a rebel in the dark

Breaking these chains, I'm letting go
Welcome to my inferno

UU, I'm a rebel in the dark. I said
UU, and this is how, this is how I'm born
UU, I'm not a devil, not a god
UU, I'm just a rebel in the dark

Breaking these chains, I'm letting go
Welcome to my inferno
