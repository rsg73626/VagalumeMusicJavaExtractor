POINT OF NO RETURN

So here I am, I'm what you all been waiting for
Not gotta know, not just the fire, I'm willing to go
My heart is on fire, and now I'm jailed to feel the flames
Let go of your worries, just let the fear become your friend

No turning back, don't tell me no
Cause I'm not gonna let you go

Here I am, here we stand at the point of no return
Here I am, once again, I know that some will never learn
It's the point of no return

No one to blame
You cannot win of you don't play
We need no reason, we need no wonder
Sometimes it's scarce to go insane

No turning back, don't tell me no
Cause I'm not gonna let you go

Here I am, here we stand at the point of no return
Here I am, once again, I know that some will never learn
It's the point of no return
