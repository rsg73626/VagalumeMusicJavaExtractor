BREAKING THE SILENCE

I'ts been seven hours since you walked out
Out of that door
You've been down and out but you keep
Coming back for more
 
One down, two day to go
Do you want more
Let's go
 
We're breaking the silence
Standing united
We're breaking the silence
Anytime you want it
 
You've been kicking tires never found
What you're looking for no
I'ts been said before but we shout it out now
Take you back down
Down to the floor
 
One down, two to go
Do you want one more
Last one
 
We're breaking the silence
Standing united
We're breaking the silence
Anytime you want it
 
We're breaking the silence
We're breaking the silence
Standing united
We're breaking the silence
Anytime you want it
 
It's been seven hours since you walked out...
