1000 MILES

Yeah!

Sleepin' in the subway, walkin' on the highway
Tell to know 'bout the stars at night
Squirting to an dead-end
Broken hearted woman
In the search for a light

I don't know what it's like
To live on that other side...

I, I can walk a thousand miles to be with you
I'd catch a falling star!
I can walk a thousand miles whenever
No matter where you are
'Cause I know you can make it!
Why you gonna break it, baby?
'Cause I'll walk,
A,
Thousand miles!

Oh yeah!

Strumming on a May-day
This story's getting changin'
Nothing new's wanted you should be, oh
No longing for tomorrow
Just show me ? sorrow
In the search for a dream

I don't know what it's like
To live on the other,
Side...

I, I can walk a thousand miles to be with you
I'd catch a falling star!
I can walk a thousand miles whenever
No matter where you are!
'Cause I know you can make it!
Why you gonna break it, baby?
'Cause I'll walk,
A,
Thousand miles!

YEAH! *Guitar solo* (Interlude)
BABY!

You don't know what it's like
To live on the other...
Si-iiiiide...!
-Yeah!

I, I can walk a thousand miles to be with you, yeah!
I'd catch a falling star!
I can walk a thousand miles whenever
No matter where you are
'Cause I know you can make it!
Why you gonna break it, baby?
'Cause I'll walk,
A,
Thousand miles!
