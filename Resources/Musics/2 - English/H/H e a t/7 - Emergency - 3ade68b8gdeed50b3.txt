EMERGENCY

I think I'll have myself a heart attack
If that's the only way to bring you back
I've had a little but I need some more
I feel the hunger burning from the core

Cause one, touch
Is all I need to keep this heart from bleeding
One, more touch
Is all I need, it's an emergency

I need to medicate, I'm screaming out
No treatment left to give but mouth to mouth
I've had a little, but I need some more
No way I'm leaving what my blood burns for

Cause one, touch
Is all I need to keep this heart from bleeding
One, more touch
Is all I need, it's an emergency

Won't you tell the doctor
That I need her now
Won't you tell the doctor
That I need her now
Won't you tell the doctor
That I need her now
Won't you tell the doctor
That I need her now
