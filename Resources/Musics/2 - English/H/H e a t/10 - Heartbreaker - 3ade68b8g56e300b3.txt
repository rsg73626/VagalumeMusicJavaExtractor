HEARTBREAKER

I never knew what your plans
But like I give a damn
Thought you were good
But you're bad
Felt like a king
Like some kind of a super man
Thought I had it under control
 
Feeding my hunger just for your taste
Baby what's wrong
And now I'm here to tell you that you're just a
 
Heartbreaker with a heart of stone
Taking what's ours and make it your own
Heartbreaker got me out of control
Fighting my way to take back what you stole
 
You come and you go as you please
I'ts like a mad disease
The fever's got me down on my kness
You're nothing but a teaser
A dirty mona lisa
The devil's got his smile in your face
 
Feeding my hunger just for your taste
Baby what's wrong
And now I'm here to tell you that you're just a
 
Heartbreaker with a heart of stone
Taking what's ours and make it your own
Heartbreaker got me out of control
Fghting my way to take back what you stole
