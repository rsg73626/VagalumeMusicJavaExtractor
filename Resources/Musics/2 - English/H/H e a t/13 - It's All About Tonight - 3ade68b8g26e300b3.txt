IT'S ALL ABOUT TONIGHT

I am no miracle man
But your wish is my command
You set the stage tonight
And I'm playing it on demand
 
Hop up and pop the bottle
You know where you belong
No stopping giving it all
Nothing gonna bring us down
 
You gotta believe
All the way we're going all the way
You gotta be free
Let it out yeah you let it in
It's all about tonight
 
We ain't got nothing to prove
We ain't got nothing but the truth
It's gonna be all about tonight
We ain't got nothing to lose
We walk where ever we choose
It's gonna be all about tonight
It's all about tonight
 
I am no credible man
And I really don't give a damn
Cause when it comes down to tearing it up
We strike like a battering ram
 
Unpack your back-idi-pack
You gotta catch up if you can
Hit me push me throw me around
Nothing will bring us down
 
You gotta believe...
 
You gotta be free
Let it out yeah you let in
It's all about tonight
 
We ain't got nothing to prove...
