RIP YOUR DREAMS APART

remember what you said x4
i will not forgive
i will not forget

every waking moment i feel like
im breaking down slowly
this is not the way i want my life
im dying, dont save me
everytime that i need you, you run
you werent there for me then
i cannot replace the time we've lost
its gone now forever...

i wake up, the nightmare begins
this time, i cant see
i wake up, the nightmare begins
my life, is diseased
i wake up, the nightmare begins
in my eyes, i cant see
i wake up, the nightmare begins
this time, i cant breathe

your words burn holes
the breaking point
emotions run cold...

im getting weak in my knees again
(this is done, let me go)
you've stabbed me in the back, one too many times
(i just need, to be alone)
I love the way you call yourself, my father
(im in love, play along)
your actions speak louder than your words
(game over, this is done)
you say you love me, like i have never heard a lie before
(this is done)
save it for someone who cares
(this is done)
rip your dreams apart
(this is done)

let the tears fall
from angry eyes
let the blood good
from what we were
let my hand go
im on my own
i will walk away
never look back...
