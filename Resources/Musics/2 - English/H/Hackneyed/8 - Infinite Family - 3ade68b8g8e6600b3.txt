INFINITE FAMILY

All I've kept is in this small box
It is heavy and full of all the thoughts gone past
I once had a vision and it took me on a mission
Blocking all morals - how nice it feels!


Mine
Half of your blood and half of you soul is mine
Coupling is good. We need it for the show, it's time...
Your old enough. We must combine!

It runs in the family

Lying naked on the ground
You know - that - you - are - duty bound to me

It runs in the family

Mine
Half of your blood and half of you soul is mine
Coupling is good. We need it for the show, it's time...
Your old enough. We must combine!

It runs in the family

The game is called incest, now it's time to play
You're mine to possess, don't try to run away

Inbreeding - in breeding is the key to the infinity
The game for the family
