HOLY SLAPSTICK

The black robe makes you trust
Wearing the cross and feeling so close to him
And that's why:

I - play'n my role, feeling so strong
I am the priesterman, am the priesterman
And I - tortured and violated you once
This is what made so strong
I am the priesterman am the priesterman out of control

When you feed me your sins, I'll puke out advice
If you give me your trust, I'll throw you back lies

Raping the sheep, abusing the weak
You feel something, but there's nothing
Clinging to lies - till the day you are dead

I am your priesterman!
I am your priesterman and I will see you dead

Dead

I coerced you once, then the rain begun
With the second stab: tempest overcome
Your mind starts rambling and fading away

I - play'n my role, feeling so strong
I am the priesterman, am the priesterman
And I - tortured and violated you once
This is what made so strong
I am the priesterman am the priesterman out of control

When you feed me your sins, I'll puke out advice
If you give me your trust, I'll throw you back lies

Raping the sheep, abusing the weak
You feel something, but there's nothing
Clinging to lies - till the day you are dead

I am your priesterman!
I am your priesterman and I will see you dead

It's the way you be, when you're treating me
This pain I can't flee - Holy agony

Welcome to the Circle of God

See how nice I'll be - Christian vanity
Send your kids to me - Holy Trinity

Welcome to the Circus of God

I am your priesterman!
Raping the sheep, abusing the weak
I am your priesterman!
You feel something, but there's nothing
Clinging to lies - till the day you are dead
