DAMN (YOU'RE DEAD AGAIN)

The gate is opened,
I come to make demands
You think you can choose,
But you don't have a chance

Dead Again

You fool around and still can't see:
The worlds has changed and it's not
As rosy as it seems to be
The flesh is foul, the blood is thick
The make-up hides all the lies
Which you wanted to deny

Damn, you're dead again

The way you're acting -
You're falling to your knees
Your view is panicked -
Incurable disease

Dead Again

I play the role, you beg of me
To change the rules, to let you go
I never want to set you free!
The time has come, the knife flashed by
Your skin turns white, loss of blood
And now you gonna die

Damn, you're dead again

I play my role, I am your god
The one you want, the one you love,
I rape you from above
I am a pig, you're in my sty
I am the one, you gonna die!

Damn, you're dead again
