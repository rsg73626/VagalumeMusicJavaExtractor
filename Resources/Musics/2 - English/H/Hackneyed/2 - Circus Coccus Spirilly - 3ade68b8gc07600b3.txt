CIRCUS COCCUS SPIRILLY

The circus, the circus coccus spirilly

There is something inside me
I don't know why, but I think it will prevail
The death comes clearly,
I see everyday like it's a chase

Death within, I feel it is stalking around
Death within, I'm coming. I'm coming unbound

Feel inside. I feel it is growing inside
Feel inside. I feel it grow inside!

There is something inside me
Don't know why, but piece by piece I die
The Death is coming after me
Don't know why, but piece by piece I die!

The silent, the silent is take-over
Is raised above me and takes away the pain
There is something that grows inside me
I don't feel fear - the end is near

There is something inside me
Don't know why, but piece by piece I die
The Death is coming after me
Don't know why, but piece by piece I die!

The violent take-over is done
Eating me, there are no limbs to flee
It's taken over, it rules inside
I can't feel fear, the end is near!

It'S Taken Over

There is something inside me
Don't know why, but piece by piece I die
The Death is coming after me
Don't know why, but piece by piece I die

There is something that gnaws inside of me,
No brain to fear, the end is here
