MAGIC MALIGNACY

Compurgation of my dreams
Compurgation of my dreams - Begone!

I - I must please my - soul,
By - ripping you from neck to ass
Somehow - I statisfy - life
I - hope to find something to behold

My spirit's rising, my spirit's rising
With every bite of you
And when you're screaming, I scream too
And find my peace in you

Compurgation of my,
Compurgation of my dreams
Bathing in your philtre
Is compurgation of my dreams - Begone!

I - I swallow your - soul,
And - I tear your mind apart
From now, you've reached the dead end
Cry - cause there is no hope left,
With my hands in your chest,
I will rip out the rest,
Till there is nothing left,
Just rotting skin and flesh - and bones

Bones - The framework starts to droop
Bones - Basis for my soup
Bones

My spirit's rising, my spirit's rising,
And you're very tasty too

Compurgation of my,
Compurgation of my dreams
Bathing in your philtre
Is compurgation of my dreams

My hands are sliding over you
I want to show you something new!
Exploring every inch of you
I'll get to know you through and through!

Feel my hands inside of you
Feel my heart, can you feel me too?
A deeper love you will not find,
As I stroke my hands along your spine

Compurgation of my,
Compurgation of my dreams
Bathing in your philtre
Is compurgation of my dreams
