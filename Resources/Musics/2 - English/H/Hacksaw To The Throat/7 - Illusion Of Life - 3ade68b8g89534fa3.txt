ILLUSION OF LIFE

endless filth
covering every inch of poisoned earth
no way to escape
the endless bile piling up at the back of my throat
no purity it's an illusion that never was
their shit stained face leaves me quenching end
wretched vile nothings are still more than me
fuck life it is nothing
no reason to strive for an existence I cant achieve
no new thought just plagiarism of life
everything of worth is forgotten tomorrow
fuck everything that god calls life
my life is shit that god will flush away when he finishes
I affect nothing not even myself
