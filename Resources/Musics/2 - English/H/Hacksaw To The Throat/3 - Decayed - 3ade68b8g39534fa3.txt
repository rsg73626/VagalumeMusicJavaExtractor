DECAYED

white washed bleeding sky
breathing vision slowly dies
enclosed a capsule
no mind no desire
a violent revolution
a poisoned awakening
choking cold... asphyxiation...
five deaths... kill temptation
worlds wasted on yesterdays tears guided into tragedy
stale breath, no promises left to keep
enclosed a capsule
no mind no desire
a violent revolution
a poisoned awakening
tonight the air is grey with death
the end is all I hear
remaining a dying echo
blinded cold and fading
white washed bleeding sky
breathing vision slowly dies
