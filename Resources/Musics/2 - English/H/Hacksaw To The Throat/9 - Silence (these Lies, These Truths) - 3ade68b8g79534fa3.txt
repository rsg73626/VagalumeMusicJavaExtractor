SILENCE (THESE LIES, THESE TRUTHS)

in her silence I hear no rejection
in her silence I hear no truth
why can't I see the truth to save myself
no I know she lies
wordless but still I can hear
her lips have yet to move
two voices tear at me
these lies, these truths
need to escape in dream
to this world where I am god
my fears no longer drain
fear no longer crucifies
silence is my peace
silence is my pain
my peace is hidden lies
lying empty my fears consume my mind
here I am god (crucified)
why this pain destroys... destroys
her mouth sewn shut, dissolving painful truths
with her I'm in pain, without her I'm blind
