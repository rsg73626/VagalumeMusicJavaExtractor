FAILED EXISTENCE

fallen into hell. contained in my failed existence
apathy has control, there is no hope
no shelter from endless failure
I cannot care... I cannot win
my shell... my shell of disbelief
shattered... shattered are all my dreams
in agony, yet I feel nothing
being numb is the greatest pain
piercing eyes of truth stare through my lies
I protect that which I hate
justice vanished for my suffering
I've become the cause of my pain
no release from ignorance
no escape from the end
cannot hide weakness
perseverance erased
my last step into total darkness
is my first step into blinding light
