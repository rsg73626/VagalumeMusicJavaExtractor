ALONE IN THE END

Every word, exactly what I need.
horrible truths erased
quiet whispers spin me in perfection
where nothing can be wrong.
her body shudders in ecstasy as I caress her flesh.
The sound of her breathing hypnotizes me soothing me into a deeper state of bliss.
Everything that escapes her lips is exactly what I need to hear.
She says I'm perfect, I'm beautiful, smart, so pure.
Every word contradicts my thoughts.
The voice inside me escapes
Maybe she just knew what to say
To dissolve all of my pain
Being with her is everything
I love her-she makes me love me.
I'm not alone
I'm left alone
