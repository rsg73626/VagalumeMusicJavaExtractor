FALL

force-fed emotion
not grief not sorrow not fake
sour and pungent
tear stained face
hate is forgotten
useless shit falls away
above it all
fuck fate
emotion--dissolves--hatred returns--too weak to resolve... Fall
power too strong, forced to let go
cannot contain lies of content
anguish is mine, never set free
endless pain, destroys me ... Fall
