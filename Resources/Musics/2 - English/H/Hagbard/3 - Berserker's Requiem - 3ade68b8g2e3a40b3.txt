BERSERKER'S REQUIEM

Against shields I charge
Spears and swords I block
When the chance comes
I will crush their heads

The odds to survive
Are now but none
Dilacerating those bastards
I hold my ground

Eyes filled with rage
Hand holding a blood red mace
Ground covered by broken skulls
As I remain slaying those fools
I keep raging on and on

I've already lost the count of
The number of dead bodies
But the end of their army
Still cannot be seen

Surprised they watch
A smile emerge on my face
Guess they can't understand
The thrill to face death itself
