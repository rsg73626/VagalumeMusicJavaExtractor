MYSTICAL LAND

From father to son a tale is passed
About a mystical land
Where the sun is warmer 
And moon shines brighter
Everyone sings and dances

But if you find it, you will never come back 
From this land so far
Delightful fountain of life will envolve you
And purify your heart

Sailing North
Where our dreams will become true
In our way to the lost land
We will find the fountain of youth
Singing with our friends
We keep our hopes alive
Celebrating the day that will come
And leaving our fears behind
