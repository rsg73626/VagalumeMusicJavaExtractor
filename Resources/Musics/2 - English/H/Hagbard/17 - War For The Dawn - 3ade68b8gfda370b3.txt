WAR FOR THE DAWN

The long night
Came as a whisper
It froze everyhing, everywhere
A never ending winter
Brught hunger and horrors, no one could bear

Demons from the lands of aways winter
Marched towards the kingdom

They came with swords of ice and wights
And fought the living with all their might

A war for the dawn, terros unleashed
The others were fierce, unstopable beasts

Finaly, the end of night came, as the last hero made his fame
Lightbringer brought their demise, eternal glory, is his prize

Raised trought magic an impervious wall
Build to guard us and seclude them all

To the nights, watch sworn brothers
The duty to protect the borders

A war for the dawn, terros unleashed
The others were fierce, unstopable beasts

This is the war for the dawn
Brought to our core, the others were fierce, unstopable beasts
