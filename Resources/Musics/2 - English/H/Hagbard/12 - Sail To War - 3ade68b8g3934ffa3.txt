SAIL TO WAR

Walking on white plains
Coldness surrounds us
In search of a ship
To travel far east

We've got nothing to offer
We've got nothing to trade
When we find this ship
It'll be better if nobody is around it

For long days we've sailed
To aid our brothers at war
The enemy we will engage
And provoke a new carnage

We've found our vessel
In a seashore nearby
We will go on and fight
And slay the unending guards

Six for each of us
And still they fell
We are but invencible
With the support of our gods

Sails up high
Wind blowing strong
Excited and anxious
To join the slaughter

We are getting near
The warcries can be heard
We shall disembark
And rip them all apart!
