WARRIOR'S LEGACY

Since we were born
We were chosen to fight
To be the heroes of our land
Honoring our sacred sand

Gods blessed our swords
With glory and might
No matter how hard one tries
No mortal can take our lives

Warriors have no fear
Honor and glory is all we need 
Valhalla awaits me
Fighting for life and that's how we live
We are the warriors' legacy

My mission is to protect the kingdom
To be the strongest and never fail
All the enemies I will defeat
Or my friends will do it
