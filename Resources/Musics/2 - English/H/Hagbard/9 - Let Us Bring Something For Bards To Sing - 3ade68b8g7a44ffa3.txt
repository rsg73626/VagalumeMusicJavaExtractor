LET US BRING SOMETHING FOR BARDS TO SING

May the gods be with us
While we tread our path
To fulfill our fate
We go without regrets

In search of wisdom
Treasures and battles
We travel across the horizon
Uncovering all the unknown

Through the mountains we ride, through the seas we sail
Our instincts guide us through these battlefields
Let us bring something for bards to sing
With fearless hearts challenges we'll win 

The stories we lived
Will be sung by our sons
They'll remember our names
And be proud of our deeds
