MARCH TO GLORY

An ancient bard had a vision
"Tonight the end will come
A mighty army will come from the north
To burn our kingdom to the ground"

But we decided to fight
To protect our friends and family
I recruited an unstoppable army
And to the northern valley we went

(With our hearts) we will fight
(With our Swords) we will strike
(With our strenght) we will bring death to the oposers

To save our kingdom we would die with honor
In the sky our swords will shine
A glorious return
Our enemies will fear our names
We'll defeat them with our strenght
And send them to the grave

Arriving at the valley
we found the enemies marching 
With rage, we started the attack!

Only a few survived that battle
But the mission was complete
The living ones can rest
Because our kingdom is safe
