STORMBORN QUEEN

Start the freedom revolution
Conquer an army with bright light
Disgrace taught her retribution
The true heiress is ready to fight

See the dragons' breath in the sky
As blood and fire shows us the way
Hear our mighty war cry
In her name we'll slay

Inside the fire she became the mother of dragons
Unburnt and strenghtened
Viserion, rhaegal and drogon
The iron throne she'll reclaim

Fly my sons show them our might
I'm destined to rule as your queen and I'll fight
Born in torment filled with pride
