DETHRONED TYRANT

The king's words
"Pay what I demand
If you do desire to live
Otherwise my army will hunt you all
No one will be able to flee"

We shall fight against his opression
The king does not own our lives!
United we'll knock them down
And show him the people's might!

I recruited
So many comrades
To face the king's wrath
With unbreakable will
And unspeakable might
We fought for our freedom

The Kingdom is in ruins
As we celebrate our victory
Better days are coming
We are finally free
