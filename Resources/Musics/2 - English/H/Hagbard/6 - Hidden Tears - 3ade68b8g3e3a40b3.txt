HIDDEN TEARS

Time has come
look what've you become
a fearless man
with generous heart
my Lovely last born son

Now you're a man
and you have to leave
find your love
and make your dreams come true
we will miss you so

Go my son follow your path
gods will guide your steps
Go my dear, your journey starts
hidden tears of my heart

Dont be afraid
of challenges you'll find
fulfill your fate
and never give up
you'll prove your worth

Your fate will be trailed
by the choices you'll make
take my love
we'll wait for you
until the end of time
