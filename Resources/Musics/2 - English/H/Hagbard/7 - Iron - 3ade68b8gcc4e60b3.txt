IRON

The silence breakes the ground
a shadow is riding the horizon
an arcane man arrives to town
remoresless and condemned
tasted the snake's poison
broken every bone
felt a thousand gunshot wounds
but there's nothing that whiskey can't cure

ride through the crossfire
ride through the flames, like a predator in the night
the eagles fly into eternal sunset
the heroes die, dying for their pride

awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
eyes are filled with lust to kill
beware, he's crying out your name
now the time has come
when the iron tears the heart
and the trumpets will ring loudly
as the stars are painted with blood

blazing fire under the moon
burning taste of lead
we'll ride forever
cause' the iron is stronger than death
