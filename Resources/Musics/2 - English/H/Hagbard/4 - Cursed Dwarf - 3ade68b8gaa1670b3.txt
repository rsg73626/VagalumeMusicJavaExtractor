CURSED DWARF

All over the golden castle
A whining echoed
When a monstrous birth
Brought the third heir of the lion
A shame for his father
Condemned by the family
Exposed as a freak
The imp had a heavy burden to keep

Through suffering he learned
His value lies not
In the reach of his arms
Nor in a bright smile
But in his mental excellence

The wind blows against him
But he shall not stop fighting
Following his path without regrets
And always paying his debts

Branded for eternity
To live in deep sadness
For the cost of his first breath
Was his own mother's life
Rejected from the start
Forced to face his limitations
To owners of broken hearts
Whores and wine come as consolation

Bearing an uncertain future
Blamed for crimes he did not commit
In spite of his size
He was strong as a lion's roar
The cursed dwarf

The wind blows against him
But he shall not stop fighting
Following his path without regrets
And always paying his debts
