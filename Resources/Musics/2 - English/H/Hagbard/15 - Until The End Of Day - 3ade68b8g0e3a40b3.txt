UNTIL THE END OF DAY

All the rules I'm breaking down
I'm leaving my den with a vow
And there's no how
I'd go back now!

Striking enemies with my sword
Making my way through the unexplored
Facing some hordes (without forfeit!)

I came from the lake of fire
where glory is our desire
Drinking and singing with my friends
Until the end of day! HEY!
