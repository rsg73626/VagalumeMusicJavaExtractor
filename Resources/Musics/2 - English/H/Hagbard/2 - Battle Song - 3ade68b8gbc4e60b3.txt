BATTLE SONG

Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
feel the winds of death on your skin
see the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
hear the screams of men, as they die

as the die
we won this battle with might and fearless hearts
we came and we fulfilled our prophecy
so now we shall march back towards our kingdom
with heads up high and glimmering eyes
we returned with our glory

silence now falls upon this blood red field
vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
this is a great moment for all of us
but now it's time to head back home victorious

victorious
we won this battle with might and fearless hearts
we came and we fulfilled our prophecy
so now we shall march back towards our kingdom
with heads up high and glimmering eyes
we returned with our glory

aahh!
(aahh!)
we won this battle with might and fearless hearts
we came and we fulfilled our prophecy
so now we shall march back towards our kingdom
with heads up high and glimmering eyes
we returned with our glory
