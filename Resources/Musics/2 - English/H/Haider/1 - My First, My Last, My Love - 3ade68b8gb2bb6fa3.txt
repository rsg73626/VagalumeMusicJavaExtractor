MY FIRST, MY LAST, MY LOVE

Such a beautiful face 
She had
His eyes shined 
'N captured me
Was I dreamin'? 
(I think I'm in love) 

Oooh, oooh, oo, uuh

Now let me represent
The biggest part of me
Oh, girl  
Am I good for you?

You my first 
You my last, my love

Love me baby 
I'll love you twice
Show you things 
The world
If you're ready 
Take a fly with me 
(Fly with me)
Show you things 
I swear it's real 
(I swear it's real)
Show me baby the same 
(The same for me)
Now you got ma heart 
I swear it's true baby

Oooh, uuuh

(Yo the only one)
Yo the only one
The reason 
I'll give up my world
Just to be with you

Oooh, oooh, oo, uuh

Now let me represent
The biggest part of me
Oh girl 
Am I good for you

Now believe 
That my love for you 
Is real
All the words I said 
It meant to the end
By the way, just wait 
Don't go to far
I'm gonna walk 
The distance 
To you're heart

You my first
You my last, my love
You my first 
My last, my love

You my first 
You my last, my love
You my first 
My last, my love
