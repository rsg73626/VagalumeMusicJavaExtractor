WE SAIL THE OCEAN BLUE

We sail the ocean blue,
And our saucy ship's a beauty;
We're sober men and true,
And attentive to our duty.
When the balls whistle free
O'er the bright blue sea,
We stand to our guns all day;
When at anchor we ride
On the portsmouth tide,
We have plenty of time to play.

Ahoy! ahoy! the balls whistle free.
Ahoy! ahoy! o'er the bright blue sea,
We stand to our guns, to our guns all day.

We sail the ocean blue,
And our saucy ship's a beauty;
We're sober men and true,
And attentive to our duty;
Our saucy ship's a beauty,
We're attentive to our duty;
We're sober men and true,
We sail the ocean blue!
