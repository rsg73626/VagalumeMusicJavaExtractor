WHERE THE HEART IS

High above the tallest trees
courage will come your way
It's the need that burns the trust that shines
When you climb out of the shade

Your high awakes the things you want to be
Where the air is thin and sweeps you off your feet

Where the heart is
When the light's at your side
When the faith is ready
No more guidance
Take the leap of your life
As the ground is shaking

Shaking off your troubled soul
As silence seems to grow
It's the faith in sight, the doubt that fades
As the world dissolves below

Your high awakes the things you want to be
Where the air is thin and sweeps you off your feet

Where the heart is
When the light's at your side
When the faith is ready
No more guidance
Take the leap of your life
As the ground is shaking

You are falling to the stars, you are falling
You are falling to the stars, you are falling
You are falling to the stars, you are falling
You are falling to the stars, you are falling

Where the heart is
When the light's at your side
When the faith is ready
No more guidance
Take the leap of your life
As the ground is shaking
