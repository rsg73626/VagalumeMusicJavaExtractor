FINDING OUT MORE

Won the fight
She tell you not to wait
I rather it haze
Wild man take a turn
Finding out more
So many times
Longed for the break of dawn

It's the morning we'll call
With courage waking up
Finding out more
We're finding more ways
If you need it all
We'll try to operate
(Humming)
Show me light
Come to the other road
Where the cold never stays
Wild man take it all
If you like to go far, run fast

But if you chase love don't pass
Chances never build to last
I better run and chase
Finding out more
Finding more ways
If you need it all
We'll try to operate

If you like to go far, run fast
But if you chase love don't pass
Chances never build to last
I better run and chase
And I will find more
Finding more ways
If I need it all
Try to operate
And I will find more
Finding more ways
And if I need it all
Try to operate
