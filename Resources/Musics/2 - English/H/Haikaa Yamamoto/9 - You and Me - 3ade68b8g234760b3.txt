YOU AND ME

It's not about a trip
It's not about a hobby
It's not about the clich√©s they repeat
It's not about a party
Where everyone was there
I haven't got that sorta time to spare

It's not about the ties
It's not about a habit
It's not about the part of me they wish to see
Many people you have known
Do they make you feel you're on your own

It's not only you and me
I know there are people out there
Like you and me
And maybe we can be friends
In harmony
With our differences
I wanna find out where they are
I wanna find out who they are
Can someone tell me where they are

It's more about a fool
Trying to be cool
It's more about the identity you lose
It's more about a sense
Of having to be there
It's more about avoiding silence

It's more of the same
Listen to what they say
"But we always do it this way"
Many people you have known
Do they make you feel you're on your own
