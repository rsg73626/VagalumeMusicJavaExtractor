THE ONLY REASON

Time and again I get the same
What do you want from life
I'm not sure you'll understand
It's kinda hard to be defined
It makes the sun shine
It makes a new day rise
It can be greater than life

It gives me courage
And inspiration
To turn my world around
I need it like the air I breathe
I am made of it
The answer's love
The only reason worth living for
Time and again I hear someone 's voice
Can love be a goal to strive for
I put my feet back on the ground
I look at the world around

It's meaningless
It's clear to me
It's devoid of happiness
There's nothing I missed
If there's no love
I'll cease to exist
It gives me courage
And inspiration
To turn my world around
