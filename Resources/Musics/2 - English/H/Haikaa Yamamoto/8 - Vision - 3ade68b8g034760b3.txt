VISION

I ran so hard
To end up
Wanting more
Different faces
And names
But I've been here before
Different places
They feel

The same
I need a way
To get out
Of this maze
To the left there's a wall
To the right well I've been there before
Left and right back and forth
To get out I got to look above

Vision of love
Vision of faith
Vision of inside
Vision of joy
Vision of hope
Vision of light
It seems
Uncomfortably

Familiar
Stuck in a scene
I have seen
Over and over
In the wrong place
Trying is
In vain
I need a way
To get out
Of this maze

To the left there's a wall
To the right well I've been there before
Left and right back and forth
To get out I got to look above
