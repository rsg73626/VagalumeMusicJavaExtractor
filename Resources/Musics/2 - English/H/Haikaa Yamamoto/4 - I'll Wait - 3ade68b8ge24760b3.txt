I'LL WAIT

I light up a candle
I speak to your angel
I fill the room with roses
I'll wait in happiness

I look deep inside
I understand the reasons why
I cherish every day
And wait in happiness

Even though you say
You don't feel the same way
I know it's just a matter of time
For you to open your eyes
And see how we belong together

The day you come walking through that door
And you give me the smile I adore
The day you come walking through that door
To make things much better than before
Only to be with me to
Hold me to love me till the
End of days I'll wait

The sun will always rise
Snow will melt away
The flowers will blossom
I'll wait in happiness

Even though you say
You don't feel the same way
I know it's just a matter of time
For you to open your eyes
And see how we belong together
