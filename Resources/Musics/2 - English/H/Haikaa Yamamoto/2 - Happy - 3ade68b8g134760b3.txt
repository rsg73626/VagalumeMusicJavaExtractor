HAPPY

Dancing
As if I could swim in the air
Looking at the moon
And think it's smiling at me

Living
As if life were a stream
Not fighting
Against it as it is

Changing
When change is what it takes
Watering my garden
With the tears I shed

Knowing love
Whatever size or form
Letting go
As the best is yet to come

These are the things
That make me happy
These are the things
That make me happy oh
These are the things

That make me happy
These are the things
That make me happy oh so happy
Life's beautiful
I think you're beautiful
Don't you think I'm beautiful?
Cause everything is beautiful

Freeing
All the fears I hide
Singing all the songs
That get me carried away
Waiting
For the right time and place
Letting grow
The things that make me dream
