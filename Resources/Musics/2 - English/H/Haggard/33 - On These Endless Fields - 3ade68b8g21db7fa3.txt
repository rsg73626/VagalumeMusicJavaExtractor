ON THESE ENDLESS FIELDS

Their horses heavy 
In clad and chain armor 
March into battle 

Man against man 
Sword against sword 
Hammer and axe against shield 

Let the banners fly high 
Mortal screams pierce the cold air 
As steel meets flesh and the strong rule the weak 

And then, the great rains set in 
And but for a moment it seemed 
As if all the blood had been cleansed by the Gods
