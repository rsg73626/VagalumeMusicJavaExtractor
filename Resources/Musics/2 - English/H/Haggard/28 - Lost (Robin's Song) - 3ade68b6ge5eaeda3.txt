LOST (ROBIN'S SONG)

Running away in the autumn rain
Did you ever see a little child sleeping?
"To be near them will my sorrow drain..."
Suddenly I stopped, their bodies weren't breathing anymore
And I couln't help!
They captured my heart with their sorrow... it grows
-
Due to the ones who fear
Dance in the morninglight
Due to the ones who fear
Slaves to this innocent might
-
Due to the ones who fear
Dance in the morning light
Due to the ones who fear
Slaves to this innocent might
-
Carrying away the ones I love
Folden hands, they have been blessed
Now I feel angry 'bout the ones above
Just no warning, no sign
Hey, yes, I fear!
And I just really feel darkness inside
Lost without a chance to hide
-
Due to the ones who fear
Dance in the morning light
Due to the ones who fear
Slaves to this innocent might
-
See me down
Down on the ground
Hoping that nobody hears
The sound of these falling tears
-
Endless bleeding
Hoping that nobody sees
What you did to me!
-
Endless weeping
Hoping that nobody hears
The sound of these falling tears
-
Endless mourning
hoping that nobody knows
These feelings below
