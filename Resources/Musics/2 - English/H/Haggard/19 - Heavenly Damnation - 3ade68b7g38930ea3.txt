HEAVENLY DAMNATION

Suffering dementia
Unchains the secret's bearer
Unholy visions "God forgive me!"
Are coming nearer - coming nearer, Amen!

Lux perpetua, domine

Dementia slowly unlightens the mind
And satan steals the morninglight

Domine

Viju svet V notschi tumanoi
Ne prognat mne prisrak strany
Svet Negasnusei svetschi
Gorit, Gorit V notschi
Svet Negasnusei svetschi
Gorit, Gorit V notschi

So God has found him weeping
And wrath flickered deep withing His eyes
So thy shalt suffer
As long ago the one's been crucified
The keeper of the Lord's mark
Is rising up with this ability
Heavenly damnation
So thou shalt trust the seer...

Svet Negasnusei svetschi
Gorit, Gorit V notschi
