OF A MIGHT DIVINE

Requiem eternam 
Et dona eis domine 

Ride, ride, over the land 
Sorrow comes without a warning, dear 
And do never start to sacrifice your faith 
They, they betray 
And poisoned voices creep into your mind 
For this will be their final stand 

Ride, ride over the land! 
Outside - a light! 
He awakes in the deep of a stormy night 
They have come to get him now 
A feast for the raging crowed 
With torches still alight 

Supressed by a might divine 
"Your science of the dark" 
Revoke what has been told 
Or at the break of dawn you will feel the holy spark 
Of a might divine 

La falce della luna Ã© in lutto questa notte 

"Inside - I cry 
All I trusted in should die?" 
An instrument to ship the blind 
Through the sea of ancient times 
Of a might divine 

Now the night breaks 
And the final trial awakes 
Pressure's getting more and more 
Betrayed - all I was living for 
Of a might divine 

Supressed by a might divine 
"Your science of the dark" 
Revoke what has been told 
Or at the break of dawn you will feel the holy spark 
Of a might divine 

La falce della luna e in lutto questa notte 

Requiem eternam 
Et dona eis domine
