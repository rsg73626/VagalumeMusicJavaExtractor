PER ASPERA AD ASTRA

Lyric By Boto

(Adesso sono qui.) 
An old dungeon hidden from all the light 
Thirteen candles enlighten the dark 
Shadows are playing their games on the wall 
And a shimmering glow fills the arch 

Now, as night steps as side, and a new dawn will break 
Silently a new age of science awakes 

Old theory that has been wrong 
Power of the universe 
Will take me to the place where I belong 

Through the clauds of lies and fear 
In silent moments it comes near: 

In my deepest hour of darkness 
They will shine. 
(feel my scorn) 
endlessly. 
(The sword that killed the unicorn) 
Splenderanno . per aspera ad astra 

His theories and knowledge 
Mean danger in these times 
And those accused of heresy 
Will not longer be alive 
Hide, hide your secrets well 
For in your darkest hour you should dwell 

(Adesso sono qui.) 
An old table covered with parchments and rolls 
The great one has children of four 
Callisto, Europa, Ganymed e Io 
The bright universe to adore 

Old theory that has been wrong 
Power of the universe 
Will take me to the place where I belong 

Through the clauds of lies and fear 
In silent moments it comes near: 

In my deepest hour of darkness 
They will shine. 
(feel my scorn) 
endlessly. 
(The sword that killed the unicorn) 
Splenderanno . per aspera ad astra
