THE OBSERVER

So all the stars 
Will guide us on our way 
The Sextant as a leader 
Has duration for all days 

Look at the amazing sky 
In long and profund discoveries 
With a strong and a clear mind he's encryping 
Secrets of astronomy 

In endless nights 
He observes the sky 
This publications will change the world 

Galileo Galilei 

Only what my eyes will see, I will believe! 
Day and night - seperated by the light 

In Pisa he's required 
To teach the theory 
That the stars and all the planets 
Revolve around the earth 
But he believed 
In a different truth 
The helocentric one 
Proposed by Kopernikus 
A new age had begun 

The stolen sun 
Made their fear rise 
And man had sacrificed 
A shadow was the reason why 

And all the servants of the cross - they will deny 
Will deny the starlight 

In Pisa he's required 
To teach the theory 
That the stars and all the planets 
Revolve around the earth 
But he believed 
In a different truth 
The helocentric one 
Proposed by Kopernikus 
A new age had begun
