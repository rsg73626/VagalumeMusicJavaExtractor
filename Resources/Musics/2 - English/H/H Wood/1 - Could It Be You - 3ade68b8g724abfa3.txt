COULD IT BE YOU

I like a punk rock chick with hair just like Rihanna
Like a go-go girl who dance like Lady Gaga
They the girls that start the party
(Hey! ) So Baby could it be you
Could it be you, be you, be you [x2]

I like them girls
Girls who don't care
Sweat pants or stilettos
It don't matter what she wear
Girls that like to party
Girls that like to dance
Girls that get it poppin' but ain't looking for no man man man

Yeah party rock that ass
Can we get it started Baby drop that class
Your the type of chick that I'm not gonna pass
Look a little parched let me stock your glass
You could be the one that I choose for the night
Looking for somebody who ain't new to the life
Doesn't really matter if it's wrong or it's right
That's just what I like
