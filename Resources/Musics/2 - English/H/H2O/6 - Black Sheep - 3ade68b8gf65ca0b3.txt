BLACK SHEEP

Never fit in
I never wanted to, picked on
In school for my identity


Cos I chose to skate all day
not go to keg parties

This path was my fate and I'll
Never find my place in a 9 to 5 world
I appreciate it all now
This path my fate
No 9 to 5 world

My life my rules
Can't tell me what to do
My brothers saved me with this music scene
Theres somewhere I belong
Not on the football team

This path was my fate and I'll
Never find my place in a 9 to 5 world
I appreciate it all now
This path my fate
No 9 to 5 world
My mind was always somewhere else
Theres always a way out
