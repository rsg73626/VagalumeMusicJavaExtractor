STILL DREAMING

Started with one man
Started with his dream
United people

All human beings

Now
Ohh ohh racism
Ohh ohh poverty
Noo ooh
How does this shit
Still stain our nation

Burning down buildings
Fighting in the streets
We both want the same things
So don't point your fingers at me
Burning down buildings
Fighting in the streets
We're not making changes
Just watching on Tv

We gotta educate
Let's change history
Equality no matter religion
Love unconditionally

But
Ohh ohh politicians
Ohh ohh citizens
Who's to blame when
The fire ends

We gotta motivate
We gotta educate
We gotta stop the hate
