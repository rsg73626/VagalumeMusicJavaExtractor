UNDERNEATH THE FLAMES

Did anyone know their names? 
No oh! 
They took a leap of faith and landed 
Underneath the flames. 
That's where the learning begins. 
Giving and taking, 
But do we ever know? 
Brain stops, the heart keeps beating. 
Where does the feeling go? 
Where does the feeling go? 

Like a moth burned twice, carried far away. 
Keeps coming back because it's drawn to the flames. 
That's where the story begins. 
Living and dying to never question why. 
Silence beats the wings. 
Still we feel we need to try. 
Hearing... without a sound. 
Screaming... without a voice. 
We have, we have, we have no choice. 
Because we're drawn to the flames. 

Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames (we will follow blindly).
Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames (we will follow).

Did anyone know their names?
No! 
Did they know their names?
No! 
Did they know their names?
No! 
Did they know their names?
No! 

Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames (we will follow blindly).
Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames. 
Underneath the flames (we will follow).
