WHAT HAPPENED?

When it began, for those who don't know
it didn't matter how you looked or what you wore to a show
dress codes, FUCK NO! we didn't care
about the brand of your jeans and all that shit in your hair

But now the biggest part is all about the image and not the art
Fashion before passion!
And at nights, it makes me mad that I should have to ask:
What happened to the passion? (passion!)
What happened to the reason for screaming?
What happened the music and the message that I love?
What happened to the hard work? (hard work!)
And why does everybody look the same?
What happened the music and the message that I love?

And I know, that people change
and we go through different stages in life
and I'm not here to criticize
but the reason I scream, is a feeling inside

But now the biggest part is all about the image and not the art
Fashion before passion!
And at nights, it makes me mad that I should have to ask:
What happened to the passion? (passion!)
What happened to the reason for screaming?
What happened the music and the message that I love?
What happened to the hard work? (hard work!)
And why does everybody look the same?
What happened the music and the message that I love?

Lost (1,2,3,4) lifetime ago it seems
you gave up on your wildest dreams
but i refuse to let mine go
I took an oath, you can find me here
with an open heart and ears
refusing to surrender
I can't believe they don't remember
what it feels like to be young

What happened to the passion? (passion!)
What the reason for screaming?
What happened the music and the message that I love?
What happened to the hard work? (hard work!)
And why does everybody look the same?
What happened the music and the message that I love?
