SCARRED

Once again you find yourself
Alone without a cause
Still the same bad habits
But you haven't paid the cost
Still searching for the seed
That grew into your need
That's who you are don't hide the scar

Now you look around for sympathy
Your life's a fuckingg mess
And she can't look into your eyes
And never hate to guess
She's looking for a stone
That crushed into your home
And you're still wanting to believe
That you can cover up the scar
That's who you are, we see the scar
That's who and what we see the cut
Wear the scar that's who you are

Thinking back to when
You were a lost and lonely kid
A look back at the tragic
And the damage that it did
Still waiting for the day
It all just goes away
That's who you are don't hide the scar

Now you know the reason
Why you feel so full of hate
Throw a stone I'm sure you'll
Hit someone who can relate
And now you know the reason
For the way you are
But you're still wanting to believe
That you can cover up the scar
That's who you are, we see the scar
That's who and what we see the cut
