RESPONSIBLE

Am I responsible for what I think and feel?
Is there a model I could never be
Am I depending on you
To show, to say, to tell me what to do
Because I think, I say
It helps me find a way
To voice my opinion without all this shit
And I know, I try to read between the lines
Cause some truth may lie there waiting
But I don't

I won't sit back and let it happen
I will stand up, I won't sit back
And watch the tables turn
Is this a lesson that we've all got to learn

How can one person really know?
And set a path for me to follow
Reality deviod of truth
Can only represent the concrete proof
That I need to hear
It tells me what to fear
