EZ 2.B.

I thought this was suppose to be about open minds and unity
Not alienation, separation or who is more pc
You people pointing fingers, judging others need to realize
To each their own, get off your soapbox thrown
Who are you to criticise?

And it's so easy to be anti, close your mind up tight
And you walk around the world
Thinking everything you know is right
It's so easy to protest and so hard to fucking give
No one person has the answers, there's no one way to live

Nobody's better than no one else, straight edge or what you eat
Stand up for what you think is right, you don't have to be elite
Think of all you're missing when your on that narrow road
Do you really believe or is it just what you've been told

Stand up for what you think is right, but who are you to criticise
Your narrow mind has left you in a moral state of imaginary grace
Your cause has lost it's taste
And now you're gone
Just like that you're gone...and you're never coming back!!!

And it's so easy to be anti, close your mind up tight
And you walk around the world
Thinking everything you know is right
