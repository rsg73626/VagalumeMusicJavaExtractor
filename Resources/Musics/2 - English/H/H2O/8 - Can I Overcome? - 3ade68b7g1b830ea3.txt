CAN I OVERCOME?

Can I overcome thse things I'm feeling, a coldness deep inside
The violence, the loss of friends, it's got me desensitized
Why in the world, does the world keep trying me
I'll try, don't wanna hear all the hurt, I don't wanna see
Why can't you see

Sometimes I feel numb, I can't feel no pain
Can I overcome, things I can't explain

And I still want to try and trust again
But I just can't believe
The things I read, I just wanna close my eyes
The TV news gets me confused, so now I'm paralysed
And I can't close my eyes, pretending not to see what I've become
