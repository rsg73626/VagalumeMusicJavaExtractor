A THIN LINE

I'm calling you out for everyone to see
Because you look like, act like people you wanna be
I'm calling you out, for everyone to know
Because you look like, act like a fake!

I know you kid, so don't play the part
Yeah you got pride, you got heart
But the world you come from is much different than ours
Cos there's a thin line between
What's real and what's fantasy

I'm calling you out for everyone to see
Because you look like, act like people you wanna be
I'm calling you out, for everyone to know
Because you look like, act like a fake!

I know you kid and what you been through
and it's okay to fuck up, just be you
no one believes you in your new outfit
Cos there's a thin line between
What's real and what's fantasy

Welcome to the real world
You're not welcome in my world
You're not my brother, you're not my friend
I told you before, once again I must remind you

I'm calling you out for everyone to see
Because you look like, act like people you wanna be
I'm calling you out, for everyone to know
Because you look like, act like, a fake!
