MITTS

I can hear it on the line
While you keep saying everything is fine. 
But there's a static in your voice
And all I wanna do is read between the noise

I hear you but I can't hear you 
And I feel that something is wrong again
And now I'm losing my friend
Have we been disconnected again
I'm feeling disconnected 
Must have been something I said
Disconnected

Try and believe in what you say
I hear the click and its giving you away
And I wanna be there when you're down
Leave a message now that I'm not around
Cuz I know you but I don't know you 
You cannot tell me what's inside
why can't you swallow your pride

Have we been disconnected again
I'm feeling disconnected 
Must have been something I said
Disconnected

I hear you but I can't hear you 
And I feel that something is wrong again
And now I'm losing my friend
Have we been disconnected again
I'm feeling disconnected 
Must have been something I said
Disconnected

Have we been disconnected again
I'm feeling disconnected 
Must have been something I said
Disconnected
