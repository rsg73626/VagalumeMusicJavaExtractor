WELL BEHAVED

So listen up 'cause this one goes out to the way we hate
We wonder how we all got so /
And yes it's true we have to /
But I will never understand just how
You can pretend you are a fan when you don't question
The things that you were told
You said you told and you might as well /
Only your heart will ever know

I don't want to be part of the way we hate
I miss that good old fassioned chaos
Don't want to be another boring story
/ stand for glory

So listen up 'cause this one's all about the game we played
You made the rules and we obeyed
And if we changed it you would only feel betrayed
And you will never understand just how
We can't progress if you invest in the unchanged
'Cause it's so safe to stay the same
But I refused and as long as i resist
I must resist it but I know I'm about to lose

I don't want to be part of the way we hate
I miss that good old fassioned chaos
Don't want to be another boring story
/stand for glory

You /
How could you know?
/ but are you where you wanna be?

I don't want to be part of the way we hate
Can't fight the system when you got no rage
And I know we'll win if you give it all away

I don't want to be part of the way we hate
I miss that good old fassioned chaos
Don't want to be another boring story
/ stand for glory
I don't want to be part of the way we hate
I miss that good old fassioned chaos
Don't want to be another boy in the story
