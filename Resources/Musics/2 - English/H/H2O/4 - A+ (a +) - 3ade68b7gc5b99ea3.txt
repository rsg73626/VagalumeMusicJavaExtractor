A+ (A +)

All the feeling 
Leaving you 
Till you left alone inside a hollow shell 
Twice repeated 
Me then you 
Till your left alone not knowing who to blame 
But I, I see the handle to the hilt 
You know I'm always pulling 
But they, they won't stop 
They won't stop pushing 
I remember 
Feeling guilty 
Was it something I did? 
Or was it what I said? 

It's not you, it's not me 
The situations telling us to be 
Not you, not me 
It's what the world has left us to be
