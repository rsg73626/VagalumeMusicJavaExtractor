OLD SCHOOL RECESS

Old School-Recess!!! (4x)

Where did we go so wrong, how did we last so long
All I can think now that we're here, is when we gonna have
Some fun can't forget what we were, even if it's all a blur
And never forget why we're still young
And how we all still endure

I don't wanna be 13, I only wanna share the scene
All I really want to do is to have Saturday
Everyday for the rest of our lives

Old School-Recess!!! (4x)

When did it come to this, too much of this business
I'm not under no fucking gun
So when we gonna have some fun
Tell me how you got so sad, with all the good times we had
When all you really want is to have Saturday
When you're tired of living in the past - Saturday
When you only want good times to last - Saturday
