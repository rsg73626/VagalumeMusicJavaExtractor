ON YOUR FEET

Just when you thought you had it made
You had a life your bills were paid
But your heart was numb inside
Abandoned by your foolish pride
And this I know, nothing comes from shallow goals
I've tried and you will find, all your riches they come from inside

And here it comes that empty feeling again
I wanna help you out
I wanna make you understand what it's about
I'm not just here to be your fairweather friend
We'll see this to the end and get you on your feet again

Now that you've lost, you win so much
Now there's only you to trust, with your mind left open wide
First day of the rest of your life
So now you know there's something you can't control
It's ok, your war has died, but the battle still goes on outside
