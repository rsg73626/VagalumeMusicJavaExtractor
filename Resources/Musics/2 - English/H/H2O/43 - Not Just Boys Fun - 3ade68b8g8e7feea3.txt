NOT JUST BOYS FUN

Man you've gotta problem, who made you fuckin' king A macho pig with nothing in your head.  No girls around you, their place is not at gigs, Don't want 'em on the dance floor cause they're weak.  A woman's place, the kitchen, on her back, It's time to change that attitude, and quick.  Showing us your phobias, you're scared to see 'em think, You'd rather dress 'em up in pretty lace, All nice and colored pink.  You feel so fucking threatened, When they stand out in front, A stupid, passive piece of meat is all you really want But it's Not just boys' fun There's girls who put out fanzines, others put on shows, Yet they're not allowed to get out on the floor.  Some make the music, well that you can accept.  Hell, maybe live you'll get some tits and ass You fucking moron, your brains have run amuck, A girl's only lot in life is not to fuck!
