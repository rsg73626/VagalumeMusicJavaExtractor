EMPTY POCKETS

All these politics, it's deception
Falling on America's weak
They say we're keeping ourselves down
We sold out on half ass trailer park dreams
So now we're living with rednecks, racists, blk/white hatred
I'm trying so hard to love my nation
Underfed, overbred, I just can't get ahead
It's not about the race or the revelation

People shooting up the blocks because of empty pockets
Fighting with the cops because of empty pockets
Selling what we got because of empty pockets
Blaming every other face for our empty pockets

And I think we need a shift in direction
Better wake your ass out of sleep and stop judging others
Cause now we're living with hard times, sex crimes
Friends are hard to find, I'm trying not to lose my mind
In the low-class, high-class, in the middle sinking fast
I know you wanna blame it on my education

I'm hanging on the block because of empty pockets
Fighting with the cops because of empty pockets
Selling what I got because of empty pockets
Blaming every other face for our empty pockets
Lost without a trace because of empty pockets
