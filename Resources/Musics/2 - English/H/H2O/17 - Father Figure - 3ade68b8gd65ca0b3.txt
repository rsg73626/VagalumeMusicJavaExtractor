FATHER FIGURE

Felt like the black sheep
When I was young
After my dad passed

My life became numb
Mom working three jobs
To make ends meet so

I looked up to you
Said I don't want to grow up
Out of step with the world

No father figure in my life
Except the ones who played here tonight
Taught me to be myself
Always do whats right

I looked up to you
Said I don't wanna grow up
Out of step with the world

Fast forward to now that my change has come
To be the role model for him to rely on
Pass down the words the guidance he needs
Give back what they did for me
