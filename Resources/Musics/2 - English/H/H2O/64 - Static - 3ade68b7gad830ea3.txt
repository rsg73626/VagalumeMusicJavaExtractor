STATIC

I can hear it on the line
While you profess that everything is fine, but
Thereâ€™s that static in your voice
And all I want to do is read between the noise

I hear you, but I canâ€™t hear you
I feel like somethingâ€™s wrong again
And now Iâ€™m losing my friend

Have we been disconnected again?
Iâ€™m feeling disconnected
Have we been disconnected again?
Iâ€™m feeling disconnected

Iâ€™m trying to believe in what you say
I hear a click, and itâ€™s giving you away, and
I want to be there when youâ€™re down
Leave a message that Iâ€™m not around, cause

I know you, but I donâ€™t know you
You can not tell me whatâ€™s inside
Why canâ€™t you swallow your pride?

Have we been disconnected again?
Iâ€™m feeling disconnected
Have we been disconnected again?
Iâ€™m feeling disconnected

I wanna know what itâ€™s about
Canâ€™t understand when youâ€™re cutting out, but
Youâ€™re pretending that itâ€™s clear
Use the static when Iâ€™m driving near, so

I hear you, but I canâ€™t hear you
I feel like somethingâ€™s wrong again
And now Iâ€™m losing my friend

Have we been disconnected again?
Iâ€™m feeling disconnected
Have we been disconnected again?
Iâ€™m feeling disconnected

I hear you, but I canâ€™t hear you
I feel like somethingâ€™s wrong again
