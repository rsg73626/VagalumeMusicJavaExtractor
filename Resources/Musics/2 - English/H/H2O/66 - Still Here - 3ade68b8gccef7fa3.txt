STILL HERE

Straight edge before you were born
heard Minor threat and it was on
it was on

38 years edge what the fuck you gotta say?
Is anyone out there still here today?
Nailed to the X, man I live this shit
I am an S.E.O.G. don't ever forget it
They said my views would change but they never did!

Still here, still here, after all these fucking years
Where did you go?
Still here, sincere, after all these fucking years
Where did you go?

To all the new kids this is a way to live
it's not a passing trend, a way to fit in
I never preached shit, I just spoke my mind
to live a positive life and don't waste your time
Nailed to the X man, I live this shit
I am an S.E.O.G don't ever forget it.
All my friends did it all but I never gave, gave in.

Still here, still here, after all these fucking years
Where did you go?
Still here, sincere, after all these fucking years
Where did you go?

Where did you go? [x3]
Still here, still here, and I will never give in
