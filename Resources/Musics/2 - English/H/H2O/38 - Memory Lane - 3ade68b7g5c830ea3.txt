MEMORY LANE

Am I wasting all my time
Chasing innocence to find
A time in my life when I should have known better
Have I wasted all these years
Hiding back the tears behind a smiling face
Am I a liar?
Because I want to do what's right
But I need to understand
Do I burn the bridge /
As these thoughts come floating in
Will the memories race to a higher price to pay

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the millionth time today
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much to say

As I fumble through my lines
Tripping wires in my mind
There's a script to (fail to reach and im running)
From another place in time
Where the memories race to a higher price to pay

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the millionth time today
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much to say

Looking foward for tomorrow
Still / yesterday
Can't you see that I tried (and i know)
Can't you see that I
Can't you see I'm (driving blindly)

Am I wasting all my time
Chasing innocense to find
A time in my life when I should have known better
Have I wasted all these years
Hiding back the tears behind a smiling face

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the billionth time today
I'm still waiting


Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much to say
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
Looking for another place to play
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
