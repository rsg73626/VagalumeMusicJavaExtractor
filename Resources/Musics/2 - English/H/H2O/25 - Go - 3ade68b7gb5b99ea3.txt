GO

When you talk about your homelife 
I try to identify 
With my own memories 
Childhood life was such a breeze 
But now i'm slipping away 
From the boy my mother made 
I'm growing on, but i hold on 
To the days that made me fell so 
Powerless and ignorant 
Without a cent, without the sense to know 
That one day i would have to try 
To survive and go 

First time you gotta leave your home 
Second time you live alone 
Third time you just don't know 
Fourth time you gotta pack your life and go 

On the day my father died 
I was too naive to cry 
Inside i was so unclear 
I always thought he's reappear 
But now i'm slipping away 
From the lost child he made 
I'm growing but i hold on 
To his name and to the days of 
Innocence and selfishness 
I find these things impossible to shake 
But i won't break, until i take 
Take a fuckingg chance and go
GO
