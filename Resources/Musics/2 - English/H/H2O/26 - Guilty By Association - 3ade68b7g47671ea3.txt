GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION

Six years ago, a very hot summer night, avenue A with friends hanging tight
No future, no goals, and no destiny
Hanging on the corner for the world to see
Some friends drunk, some friends high
Laughing talking shit as the people walked by
The air was tense and muggy as fuck 
Lower east side, running amuck

Guilty by association, judged by who I know
Can't keep all my friends out of trouble
When they got no place to go

Me drug free in the midst of it all
Crazy fucking summer hanging out with madball
People got their ass kicked, people got hurt
But I was accepted for all it was worth
Bad repuations are hard to live down
I'm not guilty for who I hang around

Sometimes I felt like an outcast, trying to talk my friends out of trouble
Tried to be a positive role model, but I got caught up in the rumble
We had ideas scribbled on walls, six years later, our destiny calls
Living our lives, some of us in bands
Touring the world, but we know where we stand
we play shows together, or just hanging out talking 'bout the good times, how we got out
We're still the same fellas, still all tight, young till we die
And ready to fight for what's right
As I look back now on that summer vacation
