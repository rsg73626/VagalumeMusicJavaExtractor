WRONG

Go on, I can not blame you
No one to teach you that
The truth is hard to find
You have to seek it
You have to meet it
Reset your mind to stay in time

No oneâ€™s gonna hear you talking now
No oneâ€™s gonna care what it is all about
Cause when your mind is shut so tight
And you think youâ€™re always right
You never listen, and keep on missing

What you think is wrong
Youâ€™re standing still
While the world keeps moving on
What they say is wrong
Iâ€™ve known you for a while, but
Youâ€™re just catching on

And it doesnâ€™t phase you
Youâ€™re always saying that
Youâ€™ve seen it all, but
Youâ€™ve got to find it
Canâ€™t hide behind it
Slip on excuses â€˜til you fall

No oneâ€™s gonna hear you talking now
No oneâ€™s gonna care what it is all about
Cause when your mind is shut so tight
And you think youâ€™re always right
You never listen, and keep on missing

What you think is wrong
Youâ€™re standing still
While the world keeps moving on
What they say is wrong
Iâ€™ve known you for a while, but
Youâ€™re just catching on, and on
Catching on

No oneâ€™s gonna hear you talking now
No oneâ€™s gonna care what it is all about
I donâ€™t want to hear you talking now
I donâ€™t really care what itâ€™s about

No oneâ€™s gonna hear you talking now
When your mind is shut so tight
And you think youâ€™re always right
You never listen, and keep on missing

What you think is wrong
Youâ€™re standing still
While the world keeps moving on
What they say is wrong
Iâ€™ve known you for a while, but
Youâ€™re just catching
Known you for a while, but
Youâ€™re just catching
Known you for a while, but
