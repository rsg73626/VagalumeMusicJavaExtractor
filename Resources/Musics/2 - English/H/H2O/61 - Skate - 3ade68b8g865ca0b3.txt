SKATE

Everyday all I cared about
Kept me out of trouble
Wouldn't stop until it hurt

Carving, grinding, falling down
Always by my side, ready to ride
At any time, I'll ride anytime- Skate!
Everyday all I cared about
Kept me out of trouble
Said it was a fad waste of time
Back side, front side built to grind
The sweat, the pain, the scares the scabs
Skate and destroy, skate and create
