M & M

Growing up full of apologies 
Spent all my time trying to be me 
We all know it's never really easy 
At least I know I can admit it 

You need to remember, you need time to forget 
We need the time to change our minds 
And separate the present from tomorrow 
Disguised as yesterday 

Time moves so slow, but change comes too fast 
On top of the world, how could it last? 
So many hands to shake, never give you a break 
They think you have it all 
But where are those hands when you're falling 

I remember how it used to be 
Things were great, why did they change 
You need time to remember, you need time to forgive 
We needed time to make our minds 
And try to change the present for tomorrow 
Because of yesterday
