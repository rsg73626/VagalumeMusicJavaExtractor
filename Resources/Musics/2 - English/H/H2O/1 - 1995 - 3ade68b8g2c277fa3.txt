1995

So Fresh, So Green 
Back then there was a scene 
That's when the music meant the most to me! 
First tour we want more, be careful what you wish for 
If you were there then you know what I mean 

This is the only life I want to live in 1995! 
I'm not coming home there's nothing there for me. 
Time flies, it goes by and then you realize 
I'm not coming home, this is where I want to be 

First song, first show and then before you know 
We're on our way to Tokyo 
Our family tree, it was just you and me 
With a whooaa it came to be. 

This is the only life I want to live in 1995! 
I'm not coming home there's nothing there for me. 
Time flies, it goes by and then you realize 
I'm not coming home, this is where I want to be
