FAMILY TREE

Roots 
Don't forget your roots 
Don't forget your roots 
Don't forget your roots 

I was thinking about the good old times 
And all the people who helped me survive 
Now who the hell knows where I'd be 
Without the branches of my family tree 

I was thinking about the friends who cared 
And all the times that we shared 
And if I had the strength to be what I could be 
Love and respect to the branches of my tree 

Family Tree!! 

Roots 
Don't forget your roots 
Don't forget your roots 
Don't forget your roots 

I was thinking about the good old times 
And all the people who helped me survive 
Now who the hell knows where I'd be 
Without the branches of my family tree 

I was thinking about the times we shared 
And all the times I was scared 
Living and learning in the NYC 
Shout out's go out to my New York Family 

Family Tree!
