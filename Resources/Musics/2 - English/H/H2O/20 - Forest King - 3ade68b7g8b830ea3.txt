FOREST KING

Do what you want it really doesn't matter anyway
A lot of different people got a lot of different things to say
But what is a reason for hunting anything
What are you hiding, what are you running from
What went wrong and made you kill for fun
It just don't make sense

Clawed my way to the top of the food chain
God gave me the biggest brain
Used my smarts to build a weapin
Now I am the forest king

Do what you want I just don't see the reward
No matter how you slice it killing is a cowardly sport
Murderous ambition, your ammunition
You really slay the fuckin' competition
A little trigger to help turn a boy to a man
I don't understand

Clawed my way to the top of the food chain
God gave me the biggest brain
Used my smarts to build a weapin
Now I am the forest king
Clawed my way to the top of the food chain
God gave me the biggest brain
Used my smarts to build a weapin
Now I am the forest king

Is this common sense?
Clawed my way to the top of the food chain
God gave me the biggest brain
Used my smarts to build a weapin
Now I am the forest king

I am the forest king
Do what you want it really doesn't matter anyway
I am the forest king
Do what you want it really doesn't matter anyway
I am the forest king
Do what you want to, do what you want to
