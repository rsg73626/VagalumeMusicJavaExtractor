TRUE ROMANCE

Rich or for poor
For better or worse
People made bets on us

Said it wouldn't work
No one believed in us
As we did each other
20 years later best friends together

True love
Exists I see it everyday
Our love
My inspiration
True love
Exists in us everyday
My strength my inspiration

Can't say it enough
You had my back from day one
You're so cool, you're so cool

Don't think I'd be
The person I am
Supported my goals and dreams
Always kept it true
When no one believed in us
We never looked back
20 years later a family forever
