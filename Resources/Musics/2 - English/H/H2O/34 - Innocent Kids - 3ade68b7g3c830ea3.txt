INNOCENT KIDS

Innocent kids!

Young, dumb, and naive
Told when to come and when to leave
Used and abused, like a bad habit does
Then accepted and neglected like and MTV buzz

Innocent kids!

Make a past for yourself
Get out the handbook
Off the fucking shelves
So put on your best fake smiles and
Pull the knives out of their backs
This better than you fantasy
Has been done kids, way, way back!

Sorry it took so long, for you to see
Made up your past now
