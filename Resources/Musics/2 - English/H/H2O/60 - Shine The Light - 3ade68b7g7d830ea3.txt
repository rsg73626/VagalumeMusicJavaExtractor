SHINE THE LIGHT

At the cost of living I die
At the cost of dying I live
At the chance of sounding selfish
It's my life time
On the chance that I'll survive
And I'll keep my soul alive
Written on the wall and sign says
It's my life time

Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me
Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me

At the cost of losing I win
At the cost of winning I lose
I guess I only have to choose
'Cause it's my life time
On the chance the world slows down
And I'm finally losing my ground
In the end I hear the sound
And it's my life time

Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me
Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me

Somebody tell me what I'm doing here
I can't find the answers in the dark
You want to know about my biggest fear?
It's wasted time, time, time
Am I wasting time?

Standing here waiting for a sign
All I want to know is am I wasting time
Click click click time 
Click click click time
Click click click am I wasting time? 

Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me
Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me
Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me
Shine the light down
Shine the light down
Shine the light down on me
