5 YEAR PLAN

My friends look out for me like family
My mom's been struggeling since I was three
My friend's look out for me like family
My mom's been struggeling since I was three
Am I scared, am I pushed, Am I worried?
Another Day, another year so what's the hurry

Here I sit, alone and in despair
The world outside is cold, alone and unfair 
No motivation, no college degree 
Day to day survival starting to worry me 

No goals, no money, no inspiration 
My cool tattoos, that's my only salvation 
5 years from now where will I be? 
On the same road with no future to no destiny 

No ideas and fear is on my mind 
Tell me, is my life just a waste of fucking time 
Someday maybe I'll find a way 
To make all my fears go away 
5 years from now where will I be 
On the same road with no future to no destiny 

My friends look out for me like family 
My mom's been struggeling since I was three (2x) 
Am I scared, am I pushed, am I worried 
Another day, another year so what's the hurry? 

Only one love in my life 
You know the rest, they never felt so fucking right 
There's got to be more, stop procrastination 
Like depending on others for touring vacation 
5 years from now where will I be 
On the same road with no future to no destiny
