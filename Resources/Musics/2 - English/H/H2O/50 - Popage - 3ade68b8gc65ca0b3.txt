POPAGE

I hear a song on the radio play
Can sing it all by the end of the day
Would you laugh at the words that I'm saying

Pop music is what I'm playing
I've got no shame

Still nothing to prove
Songs can change you
Or just make you move
Parachutes, Fireworks, Beautiful Days
You're to angry to say

I've got my mind open wide
And its fine
If you despise it
Lives to short to hide what you like
Guilty pleasures are alright
Music changed my life

They get me singing
Every time that I hear it
Even though they're not screaming for change
They pick me up when I have a bad day
I've got no shame
Still nothing to prove
Some songs change you
Or just make you move
Ain't it fun, Don't speak, Holiday
You're too angry to say!

When I got the music I got a place to go
Underground or on the radio
You are who you are, theres nothing you can do
People will always pass judgement on you
