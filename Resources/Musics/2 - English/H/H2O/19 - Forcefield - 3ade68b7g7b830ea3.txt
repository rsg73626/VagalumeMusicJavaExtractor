FORCEFIELD

I'm staying away from your negative space
You're only bringing me down
Whenever you come around
I see the look on your face, you're in a world of hate
Don't wanna be the one you take it out on

Anger is a wall around you
No-one's getting through
Friendships falling down around you
What are you gonna do?

I'm trying to give something positive
You wouldn't understand
Cause it's an open hand
Not a closed fist, are you getting the jist
Or are you just getting pissed

I'm not willing to waste my time
Believing that you're gonna do what's right
I won't be there to catch your fall
