FOLLOW THE THREE WAY

Never really been into religion
Never gave a fuck about superstition
But such strange things are happening
First once, then twice, then once again

Never really thought we'd reach a third one
Still there are those who haven't heard one
So we still have such a mission
Our trilogy must have tradition
Then once, I could not believe, even twice I was still naive
In my heart, in my head, these words are said

I don't care what you say, I'll follow the three way

I've never been into science fiction
So I guess this is a contradiction
