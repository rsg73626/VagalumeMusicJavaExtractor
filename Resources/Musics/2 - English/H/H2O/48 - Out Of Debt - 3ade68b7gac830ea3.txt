OUT OF DEBT

Giving all I got and I feel so drained
Preaching motivation, trying to fan that flame
Now it's time to turn around and do something for me
Something must have changed and you can blame reality

Something's changed but I don't feel the same
No reason why, I got no alibi and no regrets 
I must be out of debt
I must be out of debt

Lied awake at night just wondering if I did it right
Tried to be the optimist and help two worlds unite
But now I got to step it up so I don't get left behind
Something must have changed but it's ok and I'm alright

Something's changed but I don't feel the same
No reason why, I got no alibi and no regrets 
I must be out of debt
I must be out of debt
I don't owe anymore
I don't owe anymore

I'm still the same, something must have changdd
Now the world has turned and this is what I learned
I've done all I can now I'm changing up the plan
Because I need to find a way to do my own thing

Something's changed but I don't feel the same
No reason why, I got no alibi and no regrets 
I must be out of debt
I'm finally out of debt
I must be out of debt
I'm finally out of debt
I don't owe anymore
