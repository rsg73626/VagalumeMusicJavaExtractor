THICKER THAN WATER

My family looks out for me like friends
Our story never ends
We've run into the fire
And somehow water somes to save us
There are so few we can depend on
With blood there is an honor
We behave like we don't care
But it's so deep inside

It's more, more than you can see
It's thicker than water
It means more, so much more to me
It's thicker than water

We've all been struggling since I was three
How happy can we be?
We've turned some bad times into good
Always knowing where we stood
Now time has led us to the water
We get by on H2O
But remember what is stronger
And we let it flow

It runs so thick inside my viens
Through all the heartache and the pain
And everything I've come to be
