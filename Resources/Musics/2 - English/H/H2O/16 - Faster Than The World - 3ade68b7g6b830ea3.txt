FASTER THAN THE WORLD

Look for us in Cali - east bay to LA
Or with our friends in DC - the UST
We made it through the Canadian border
Back home next week in NYC

Because we're faster than the world we can't slow down

I hear the windy city calling - chitown, chitown
As we arrive in Tokyo - edemio
And the kids are cool in Kansas
Tomorrow's the Philly troc show

New York City - you can't slow down
East coast to the west coast - you can't slow down
Japan to Europe - you can't slow down
World wide hardcore punk - you can't slow down

The world will try to catch up
When they think that this is a trend
But we'll keep moving fast enough
