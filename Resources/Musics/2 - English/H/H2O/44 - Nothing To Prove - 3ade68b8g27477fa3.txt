NOTHING TO PROVE

Me and all my friends we got nothing to prove, nothing to lose! 
you know us and what we achieved 
from the streets of L.E.S to your TV! 
Many have come, and many will go, but 20 years later 
Who's still runnin' the show 
Hard times have come our way, we held it down and kept the PMA! 
With only one voice we have more to say - still mentally vexed 
TCOB!!
