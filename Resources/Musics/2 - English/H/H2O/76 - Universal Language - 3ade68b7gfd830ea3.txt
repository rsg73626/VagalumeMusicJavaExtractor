UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

What is the universal language?
Could it be hate if it's not love?
Could it be money, sex or power?
I say it's music and none of the above

When you act that way
Can't you see you're using the wrong fuckin language
A language I don't know

Do you feel an evil in the world?
Do you chase the dollar or the girl?
What's the motivation in your life?
