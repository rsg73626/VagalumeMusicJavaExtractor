FAIRWEATHER FRIEND

My friends look out for me
Like my extended family
They always have my back, right or wrong
Despite our differences
I even gave you money to live
After everyone had written you off, right or wrong.

You were a fairweather friend
You didn't have my back til the end
You took what you needed and disappeared again
Fairweather friend, you didn't have my back til the end
You took what you needed and disappeared again.

I always had a weak spot for you
You only needed me when it was convenient
I learn now, don't let people in my life so fast
Cos' they never last
I find my childhood friends are the ones I can depend on.
Cos' everyone has a past, right or wrong.

You were a fairweather friend
You didn't have my back til the end
You took what you needed and disappeared again
Fairweather friend, you didn't have my back til the end
You took what you needed and disappeared again.

We don't need friends like you
We don't need friends like you
We don't need friends like you
Right or Wrong

You were a fairweather friend
You didn't have my back til the end
You took what you needed and disappeared again
Fairweather friend, you didn't have my back til the end
You took what you needed and disappeared again.
