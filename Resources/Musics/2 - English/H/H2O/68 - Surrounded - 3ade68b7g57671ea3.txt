SURROUNDED

I wrote a story in the book of life today 
I turned the page and then I turned and walked away 
Cause what I wrote was just symbolic of the time 
I've been surrounded by another state of mind 
You do this, to gain control 
You say that, to make yourself feel whole 
You say this, just to be kind 
I see it's all just a waste of fucking time! 

Sometimes the problems freeze the pen that's in my hand 
No rules provided that will make me understand 
And then I think about the notes that I just took 
I look around, then turn around, then close the book. 

Cause I see the writing how it can be 
I write this paragraph to tell me that I'm me 
All rules provided, symbolic of the time 
It keeps me from falling into another state of mind 

I do this, to gain control 
I do this, to make myself feel whole 
I say this, not to be kind 
I see it's all just a waste of fucking time!
