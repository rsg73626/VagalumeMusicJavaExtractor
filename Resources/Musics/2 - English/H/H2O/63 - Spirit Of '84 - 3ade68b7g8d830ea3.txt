SPIRIT OF '84

You can't have me 
I won't sign my life away 
I'm not even gonna listen 
Cause your words are based on lies 
The truth escapes you 
You put your foot in your mouth 
Let me tell you what it's all about 

I feel it here 
The feeling is real 
It's the only thing you can't take away 
I feel it here 
The feeling won't go 
I'm gonna let you know 
You can't have it 
I wont give it 
You can't take it away 

Your foolish tounge 
Has been divided 
Two pths to follow 
I'm on the side of the truth 
Cause I'm united to something real 
Something that you'll never be 

I feel it here 
The feeling is real 
It's the only thing you can't take away 
I feel it here 
The feeling won't go 
I'm gonna let you know 
You can't have it 
I wont give it 
You can't take it away 

H2O GO!!

I feel it here 
The feeling is real 
It's the only thing you can't take away 
I feel it here 
The feeling won't go 
I'm gonna let you know 
You can't have it 
I wont give it
