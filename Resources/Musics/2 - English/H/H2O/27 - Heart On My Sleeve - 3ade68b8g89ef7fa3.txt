HEART ON MY SLEEVE

You see me on the street, 
there is no need to explain,
I'm not what you think I am,
I'm just like you, but with tattoos!

Cuz I wear my heart on my sleeve,
my appearance may be deceiving,
it doesn't matter what you think,
because the truth is in me!
This is the life I chose, 
this is the only thing I know,
so don't pass judgement on me!
The places that I've been, 
forever written on my skin,
so don't pass judgement on me!

You see me walking down the street,
and you grab your kids and cross the other side,
looking me like i'm a fucking criminal a degenerate lowlife,
you got me all wrong!

Cuz I wear my heart on my sleeve,
my appearance may be deceiving,
it doesn't matter what you think,
Because the truth is in me!
This is the life I chose, 
this is the only thing I know,
so don't pass judgement on me!
The places that I've been, 
forever written on my skin,
so don't pass judgement on me!

You know you can't judge a book by it's cover,
you know you got me all wrong,
and I know my appearance may be deceiving, 
but I feel...
I feel it all, 
so don't pass judgement on me!

This is the life I chose, 
this is the only thing I know,
so don't pass judgement on me!
The places that I've been, 
forever written on my skin,
so don't pass judgement on me!

It doesn't matter what you think,
because the truth is in me!
