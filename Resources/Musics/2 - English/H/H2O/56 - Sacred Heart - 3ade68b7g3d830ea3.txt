SACRED HEART

Hear what I'm saying
It was always true
I was never playing
When it came to you
Never good at showing
What you mean to me
Here's my last chance
To set my mind at ease

And all the times you slipped
Between the cracks disguised
As something sacred
Never knowing that I wanted you
Hold you in my arms, protect you
Never let the world upset you
Handing my life over to you

I was always running searching for excuses not to be together
Now the chase is over with this ring on your finger
