REPAIR

Sunshine!
It's so revealing in my head.
It's still unwinding from the road
Where I've been broken down.
But it's nothing that I can't fix.

I've been feeling, feeling broken.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.
I've been feeling, feeling broken.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.

In my mind I'm always seeing someone else's pain.
Then I remember when I felt the same.
It takes a little patience, but some time will heal the scars.

I've been feeling, feeling broken.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.
I've been feeling, feeling broken.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.

I'm alive, I never thought I'd wake up.
And now I know I still believe.
Inside the fog is lifting
Now I see what I've been missing.
And I know I only had to stop.
And pack my things it's time to go. Let's go.

I've been feeling, feeling broken.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.
Fix me up and take me home.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.
I've been feeling, feeling broken.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.
Fix me up and take me home.
I'm in need of repair. Feeling broken.
