THIS TIME

Standing alone in a situation
Somebody's talking their shit
Trying to control my frustration
Somebody's gonna get hit

But when is it right to fight?
And when is it right to walk away?

Sometimes we have no choice
And this is the price we pay Cause we don't have to be
What people see
Got our own minds
Got our own realities
We try to stick together
And let the music be our might
But this time there's gonna be a fight

We're not about senseless violence
Don't wanna spoil the fun
But when you get pushed, feels like an ambush
And this time you cannot run
