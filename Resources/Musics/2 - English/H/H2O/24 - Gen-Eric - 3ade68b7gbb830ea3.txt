GEN-ERIC

Where were you
You weren't here 
I screamed and shouted 
But you disappeared 
Where is the shoulder that made me cry 
You went away but I don't know why 

Where, were you? 

When I needed somebody to trust 
When I needed somebody to stand by 
I never wanted all that much 
Why did you leave? 
Why did you lie? 

Where were you? 

I used to love you 
But I want to pretend 
Your fucking game 
I won't play again 
Where were you? 
When I needed somebody to hold
