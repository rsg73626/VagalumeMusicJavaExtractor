MY CURSE

Too many questions 
But no one seems to know 
The value of the answers 
Too many fingers and all pointed back at me 
Is it because I was the one who pointed mine first? 
I see a problem but maybe it's part of me 
Excuses without reasons 
I have a conscious inspiring to be 
More than a thought that's burning deep inside of me 

I see a doorway and I fumble for a key 
How many turns until it opens? 
And what will it reveal? 
I'm at the center, or is it left of me 
When will it open? 

On the surface, the smile evades the truth 
The words are even cheaper 
I ask for something impossible to give
