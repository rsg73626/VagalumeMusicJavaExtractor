SCENE REPORT

Well I woke up with this feeling yesterday 
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't say 
Where it came from and what it did to me 
Like a hole inside too wide and way too deep 

But I know 
I'm gonna find my way 
and I know 
I gotta have my say 

I hate when I turn on my fucking TV 
A newsman's trying hard to explain my scene to me 
Hardcore's been my life since way back when 
It's my family, my future, my best friend 

But I know 
I'm gonna find my way 
And I know 
I gotta have my say 

It's not fashion or a TV show 
It's my life, It's the only one I know 
It's not a new concept on MTV 
It's something real beating inside of me 

Woke up with this feeling yesterday 
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't say 
Where it came from and what it did to me 
Like a hole inside too wide and way too deep 

But I know 
I'm gonna find my way 
and I know
