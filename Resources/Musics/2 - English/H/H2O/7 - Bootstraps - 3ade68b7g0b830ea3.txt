BOOTSTRAPS

I got your bootstraps, I'll pull you up and won't think twice
And you can take it as advice, we've got to help each other out
Cause that's what this is all about
And how the fuck can we forget, how we got here today, no way

Now it's time to make it clear, that we would not have made it here
Without the ones who pulled us up, taught us how to make it work
And if you ever get the chance to change somebody's circumstance
I hope you know what you should do
Cause that shit will come back to you

I got your bootstraps, I'll pull you up and won't think twice
And you can take it as advice, we've got to help each other out
Cause this is how we all survive and we're never gonna stay alive
