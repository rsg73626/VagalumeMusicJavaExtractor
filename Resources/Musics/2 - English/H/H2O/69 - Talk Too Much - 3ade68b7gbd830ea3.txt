TALK TOO MUCH

She was with him, now everybody knows
Cause she told a friend, and that's the way it goes
People have loose lips, sometimes behind your back
You know, that's how they get their kicks
When the conversation lacks, you know

Tell a tale of contradiction
Gossip causes crucifixtion
They talk too much shut up
They talk too much
And I don't like what they say
It's just a bunch of bullshit anyway

He took her out to see what he could get
He got nothing but had to tell the guys he had
That's how rumors start
Just how they end I don't know
Go on spread the word
