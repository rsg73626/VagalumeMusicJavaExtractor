DAY BY DAY

Today's a new day, not like the old days
What else can I say, that's not been said
Each day I rise up, thinking I've wised up
I realise that I don't know shit

Don't know where I'm gonna be - day by day with me
I don't know where I'm gonna land - day by day with me
My five year plan has turned to ten
And it's all gonna happen again

Milleniums coming, better start running
Straight for a place in history
So fast the past went, none of our time spent
Wondering what's gonna happen to me

Again and again through time I see - day by day
I'm going through changes to find what's best for me - day by day
I know where I am and I know where I'm from
