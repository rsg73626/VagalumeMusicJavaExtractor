HI-LO

Hi-Lo what does it mean 
Another word for temperature, followed by degree 
I know it may sound simple 
But when I look in your eyes 
Degrees of seperation is what I find 

You lie, I try, you lie, I try! 

You lie from the center, distracted by everyone 
Cause everything revolves around you 
Not saying that I'm better 
But when I look in your eyes 
Degrees of seperation is what I find 

You lie, I try, you lie, I try 

Time's up, I won't lie 
Your whole life is a fuckin' lie 
You fake, but me I stay true 
Flags up, wave 'em high 
The grass is greener, on the other side 
My mistake was ever meeting you
