I SEE IT IN US

I see it in us, I see it in us
I know it's in us but I
I see it in us, I see it in us
I see it's in us but I
I can't quite put my finger on it

We're all guilty of it
How many times do we end up with nothing
When we try real hard and only see it one way
We think we'll go further but where will we be?
Just one step closer, still moving closer
To a million miles backwards
Reality reasons, it wasn't meant to be
All this time I felt so strongly
And it was all for nothing
Nothing


I SEE IT IN US

I see it in us, I see it in us
I know it's in us but I
I see it in us, I see it in us
I see it's in us but I
I can't quite put my finger on it

We're all guilty of it
How many times do we end up with nothing
When we try real hard and only see it one way
We think we'll go further but where will we be?
Just one step closer, still moving closer
To a million miles backwards
Reality reasons, it wasn't meant to be
All this time I felt so strongly
And it was all for nothing
Nothing
