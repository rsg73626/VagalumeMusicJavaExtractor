USE YOUR VOICE

I'll use my voice
For the tortured
For the weak

Use my voice
For the innocent
Who can't speak
I'll use my voice
When the people look the other way
Got to inspire
The youth of today

Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Can't you hear the crying
I'll use my voice
For the tortured
For the weak
Use my voice
For the innocent
Who can't speak
I'll use my voice
When the people look the other way
Got to inspire
The youth of today

Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Can't you hear the crying

So many wasted lives
For things we just don't need
So many have died
For our selfish greed
So many wasted lives
For things we just don't need
Why do we have to die
For our selfish greed
I'll use my voice
For the tortured
For the weak
Use my voice
For the innocent
Who can't speak
I'll use my voice
When people look the other way
Got to inspire
The youth of today

Stand up
Stand up
Stand the f*ck up
