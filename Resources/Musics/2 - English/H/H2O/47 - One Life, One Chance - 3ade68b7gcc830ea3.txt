ONE LIFE, ONE CHANCE

What if I said, I was an accident waiting to happen
Woudl I trip and fall, fall on my words
And would you say, say that I was wrong
My words were out of place, went where I didn't belong

This to me is fact and fiction plays a role
Confusing situations that I can't control
The heart of matter, it beats with pride
Sometimes I wear it on my sleeve, sometimes I keep it inside

And no one said it was gonna be easy
And I'm not afraid to try
And with the odds stacked up against me, I will have to fight
One life, one chance, gotta do it right!!!

And I can't let fate dictate what's best for me
Gotta take control of my own destiny, you can't relate
You think there's no escape but I got everything at stake
Here just to prove you wrong!

And no one said it was gonna be easy
And I'm not afraid to try
And with the odds stacked up against me, I will have to fight
