RIPE OR ROTTING?

The clock is ticking but I'm rotting

Tell me are you rotting?
If you're going to change just do it now
Are you ripe or rotting?
Only you can keep you down
Are you ripe or rotting?
If you're going to change just do it now
Are you ripe or rotting?
Don't want to deal with life's / and / it makes you afraid
/ all the plans that you made
So much potential but you never see
Rotting away but you used to be ripe

I want my pictures back
My innocence I can't I can't retrieve
If it's so hard just to believe
Time to take it back
Don't let them kill your dreams
It's not as hard as it may seem
Don't be afraid to take a chance
Must be a way to make your circumstances right

How many doors will they slam in your face?
