FROM THE HEART

Sacrifices made
To follow our dream
Grass isn't greener

Or so it seems
A boat full of sailors
No rules apply
Play our hearts out
Until the day we die

We made our mark did our part
Straight to you from the heart
Half our lives playing these songs
Doing what we love
Can't believe how long

A blessing and a curse
All in one
Losing time with our loved ones
In the name of fun
Bonds were made along the way
And friends were lost
We play here for you
At any cost

H2o go!
