I KNOW WHY

And so she said to me 
I'm leaving, I can't take it anymore 
For all that it's worth, I knew that was over 
Long before she turned the handle on my door 

Cause I can read between the lies 
And I can see behind your eyes 
All the lies and alibis 

And I can understand your mind 
I can see through all your lies 
All your eyes and alibis 

And so it's over as the pictures 
From my wallet hit the floor 
Well I stand in distrust 
Cause I can't believe it's happening 
And my head tells me my heart should close the door 

Cause I can read between the lines 
And I can see behind your eyes 
All the lies and alibis 

And I can understand your mind 
I can see through all your lies 
All your lies and alibis 

I tried hard to erase 
Cause I don't think that I could ever replace it 
I think of all the time I wasted 
Listening to your lies 

And so it's over 
As I wipe the visions of you from my mind 
Well I don't count for much 
Nut I know the next time 
Listening to these reasons 
Are they truth or alibis?
