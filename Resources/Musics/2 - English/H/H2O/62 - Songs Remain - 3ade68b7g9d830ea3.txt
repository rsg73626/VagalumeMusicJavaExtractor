SONGS REMAIN

well those 5 years are gone now,
so i've got a plan that's new.
I'm seeing the future.
but I can't forget my roots cause it's still not a concept,
someone made up on tv.
it's still something real,
way down deep inside of you and me.
(Chorus:)
All the bands we loved the most,
all the songs that give us hope reasons we're still here today,
people change but songs remain,
songs remain, songs remain in our hearts.
no matter what we do, i know you can feel it,
dispite our different views.
so if you make a connection,
we'll have both sides to see,
and noone can take that away from you,
and noone can take that away from me.
All the bands we loved the most,
all the songs that give us hope,
reasons we're still here today,
people change but songs remain.
and when you put that music on you can feel it,
you just know it, it's right for you.
and even though the times have changed that spirit,
i still feel it, it carries on,
and even though your life has changed that spirit,
you still feel it, it carries on, it carries on in every song.
All the bands we loved the most,
all the songs that give us hope,
reasons we're still here today,
people change but songs remain
