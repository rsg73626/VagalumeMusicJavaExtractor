FRIEND

If I say something that you don't like
Just think about it cause I may be right
If I say something just hear me out
Cause I just might know what I'm talking about

If I say something whatever I say
Cause my words have meaning and that's the truth
Life's full of problems and baby that's ok
Inside the crew and that's the way

So just remember that what I say
When I say something well don't turn your head
I'm here to help you when things go wrong
