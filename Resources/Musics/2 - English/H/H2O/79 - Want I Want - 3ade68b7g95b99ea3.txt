WANT I WANT

I want what the other kids have, I want it all 

I want I want what the other kids have 
I want brand name shoes 
I want perfect teeth and something to smile about 
I want an invitation 
And my own cell phone and something to talk about 
I want imagination 

But there's no money for me to pay 
I want I want what I want and I want it now 
There's enough food on the table so I guess it's ok 
I want I want and I want it now 
I want I want 
I want I want what the other kids have 
I want I want, I want it all 

I want I want that video game 
Don't want to have to use my brain 
I want to go where the cool kids go 
I'm sneaking in but they don't know 

There's no money for me to pay 
I want I want what I want and I want it now 
But there's enough food on the table so I guess it's ok 
I want I want and I want it now 
I want I want, I want it all 
I want I want 
I want I want what the other kids have 
I want I want 
I want it all 

If I don't get these things I ask for maybe I should run away 
But there's enough food on the table so I guess I'll stay 
I want I want 

I want I want what the other kids have 
I want brand name shoes 
I want perfect teeth and something to smile about 
I want an imagination 

There's no money for me to pay 
I want I want what I want and I want it now 
But there's enough food on the table so I guess it's ok 
I want I want and I want it now 
I want I want what the other kids have 
I want I want I want what the other kids have 
I want I want I want it all
