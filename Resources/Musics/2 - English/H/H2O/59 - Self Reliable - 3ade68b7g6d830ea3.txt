SELF RELIABLE

What if you could live your life
Like you're the only one around
Would you do it just to see if you could
Or would it scare you too much
Not to see your friends hail, hail the gangs not here at all

Self reliable, that makes you responsible
For all the lies that you told
And you're telling them to yourself

What if you could live your life a minute at a time
Make the most of everything you do
Or would it scare you too much to enjoy the life you lead
Always complain about the things that you don't need

Self reliable, that makes you responsible
For all the lies that you told
And you're telling them to yourself
Self reliable, it may be a lot of work
But in the end it's the job that pays you well
Job that pays you well

Introspection, self doubt
Just trying to understand what you're all about
Will it end with contradiction
Would you feel the urge to scream
And wake up from this dream you don't know why

Self reliable, that makes you responsible
For all the lies that you told
And you're telling them to yourself
Self reliable, it may be a lot of work
But in the end it's the job that pays you well

Self reliable, that makes you responsible
For all the lies that you told
And you're telling them to yourself
Self reliable, it may be a lot of work
But in the end it's the job that pays you well

Self reliable the job that pays you well
Self reliable the job that pays you well
