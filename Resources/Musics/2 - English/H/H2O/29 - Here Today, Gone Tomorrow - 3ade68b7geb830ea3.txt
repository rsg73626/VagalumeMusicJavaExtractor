HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW

I remember all those bands 
Preaching with motherfucking X's on their hands 
The Youth Of Yesterday, what else can I say 
The times have changed and they've faded away 

The times have changed and the trends move on 
The spirit of youth I still carry on 
Close minded attitudes, you know the youth crew 
Alienating everyone who didn't think like 
who didn't 
Act like 
Who didn't 
Look like you 

Here today 
And gone tomorrow 
Memories Of Yesterday 
Leave me in sorrow 
Here today 
And gone tomorrow 
Sincerity? It was only borrowed (Repeat) 

Hey but where are they now? 
Cause I'm still here and I'm drug free and fucking sincere 
Hey but that's okay cause they're out of the scene 
They're denying hardcore while they chase the green
