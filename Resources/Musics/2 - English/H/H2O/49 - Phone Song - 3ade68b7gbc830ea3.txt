PHONE SONG

Sitting by myself at home
Waiting for a ring
I fight the urge to pick it up
so I can do my thing
I try to stay connected to
The lives of everyone
Tonight i'm calling you
Cause i got nothing better to do
I feel so alone and I
Can't get off the phone
I hope you're not at home cause I
Can't get off the phone

I know it's my obsession
But i see you got nothing better to do
I call because hearing is believing
And the only time I can't hear it ringing
Is when I'm singing
The phone is an extension
To my arm and mind
I talk, talk, talk to dusk to dawn
