REPUTATION CALLS

Know all about you but are you just a name
You like the feeling a reputation brings
Some say your violent and people are afraid
I say you're silent and holding back the pain
Inside - you just can't live a lie
Inside - just can't live a lie

Reputation calls and now it follows you
But what about the changes you been going through
One of these days the things they say
Won't mean the same as before then when reputation calls
You don't have to answer anymore

One of these days when you don't feel so hard
One of these days when you put down your guard
Heart hanging out for the world to see
