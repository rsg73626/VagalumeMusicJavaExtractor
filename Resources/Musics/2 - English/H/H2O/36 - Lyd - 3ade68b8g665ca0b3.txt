LYD

Woke up this morning
The wrong side of the bed
Negative thoughts

Inside my head

Have I lived my dash the best I can
I know I'm not a perfect man
I'm just doing the best I can

Life's short
You only live once
Doesn't mean under the influence
Life's hard
Struggle sometimes
Gotta keep a positive mind

Won't give people time
That try and pull me down
Inspiration
I choose to hang around

Dig deep for that Pma go
