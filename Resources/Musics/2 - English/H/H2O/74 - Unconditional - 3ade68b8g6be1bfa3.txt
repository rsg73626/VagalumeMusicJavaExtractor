UNCONDITIONAL

Yesterday you let go of my hand
And now I'm trying hard to understand
Was it really me you loved?
Or some imaginary, perfect man?
Cos' I will miss the good and bad

And all I wanted was someone to love me
Just the way the way I am
So far from perfect, just doing the best I can
You're leaving and I know why
So look into these tear-filled eyes and know
I loved you through it all
It's unconditional, It's unconditional

Yesterday you had to say goodbye
And I didn't even have to wonder why
Cos' we had so many things go wrong
I was there, but you were not as strong
Cos' I will miss the good and bad

And all I wanted was someone to love me
Just the way the way I am
So far from perfect, just doing the best I can
You're leaving and I know why
So look into these tear-filled eyes and know
I loved you through it all
It's unconditional, It's unconditional

And all I wanted was someone to love me
Just the way the way I am
So far from perfect, just doing the best I can
You're leaving and I know why
So look into these tear-filled eyes and know
I loved you through it all
It's unconditional, It's unconditional
