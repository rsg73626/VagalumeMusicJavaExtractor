THICK AND THIN

Some stayed clear
Some dived in
The right path or a wrong decision

Both sides of the coin when you flip it
Through the songs
We're connected

Through
Thick and thin
With you
Till the end
I'l always find the best in people
Everyone is my equal

Some wear a badge, some arrested
Over the years we all get tested
I'm not a jury just hope for the best and
Through the music
We're connected

Some grow up some stay the same
I'll never change
I love them either way
We're all here
Guilty!
