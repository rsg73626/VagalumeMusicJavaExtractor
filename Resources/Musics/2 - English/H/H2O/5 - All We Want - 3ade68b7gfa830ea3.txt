ALL WE WANT

Cover up your eyes
And put your fingers in your ears
We're about to say some shit 
That you dont wanna hear

There's too many kids out there
Who never stay changed
Who say some basic truth
Their mom and dad don't understand

All we want
Is only to be heard 
And no one told
And the kids are going crazy
Now while we're screaming for attention
No one told
And the kids are going crazy

Try and point the finger
While your running from the man
Blame it on the music 
Or the movies and the games
Turning up the volume
So that you can hear the sound
Cause what's a kid supposed to do
When no one is around

All we want
Is only to be heard 
And no one told
And the kids are going crazy
Now while we're screaming for attention
No one told
And the kids are going crazy

It's just a matter of attention
It's too late for intervention
Never give back what you lost
Cause we spend too much time together

Always on a mission
So you're always on the go
You seem to forget the homework
From someone you don't know
You were never loved
You had a choice of what to be
Your spent all your money
Trying to cover your mistakes

All we want
Is only to be heard 
And no one told
And the kids are going crazy
Now while we're screaming for attention
No one told
And the kids are going crazy now

Yeah, the kids are going crazy right now
And the kids are going crazy now
While their screaming for attention
No one told

And that's all we want
Is to be wanted
No one told
And the kids are going crazy now
While we're screaming for attention
No one told
