HELPLESS NOT HOPELESS

Ain't it strange how time just slips away
Then I got your call the other day
All these years and you're still in that place
And you really don't have much to say
Like, what about your dreams?
And are they blowing away
While you sit there wishing you could start again

Are you stuck in a rut? Helpless not hopeless
Got a fear in your gut? Helpless not hopeless
Are you waiting for luck? Helpless not hopeless

And I know how hard it is to change
With so many lives to rearrange and every time you feel so close
You forget about what you want most
Like what about your dreams
And are they blowing away
While you sit there wishing you could start again

Time, it's funny how time slips away
Time, and all your dreams they won't wait another day
Time, and it's hard, hard to make that change
