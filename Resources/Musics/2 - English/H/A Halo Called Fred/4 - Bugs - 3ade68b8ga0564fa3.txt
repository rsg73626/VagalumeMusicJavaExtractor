BUGS

are always happy
Bugs are always happy
Over here over there
Happy cause they just don't even care

If you could think just like a bug
Then you'd just do just what you want
And who would care about worries of any sort
When you're a bug
Life is just too short

Bugs are always happy
Oh so goddam happy
On the ground in the sky
Bugs are just another guy

Bugs could not ever go veggie
Cause they eat stuff that you can't see
They don't do health food or cigarettes or drugs
And even vegetatians
Like to kill bugs

There is just no reason why
