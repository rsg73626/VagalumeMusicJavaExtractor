BLYMY THE PYRATE

Blimey! I'm a Pirate! And I've got a patch on my eye!

EVIL PIRATE :
I'm the evil pirate! I want that Blymy Dead! Gonna make him walk the plank and have the sharks bite off his head! Kill that damn Blymy!

COOK:
I cooked his supper jolly out of boiled cats and schnauzers. No need to spend our bounty on a tin of SPAM from Krausers. So like Inspector Gadget, Blymy turns to me and says: "Wowsers! I'd rather be having a splendid time in Trevor the Wanker's trousers!"

SHIPHANDS:
OI!

PARROT:
Brok! He's a Pirate! And he's got a patch on his eye!
