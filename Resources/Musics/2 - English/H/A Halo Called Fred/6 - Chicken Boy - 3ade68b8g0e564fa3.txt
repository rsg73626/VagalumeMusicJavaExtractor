CHICKEN BOY

His name is Chicken Boy. He is a chicken. He is a boy. It fits. Chicken Boy.
And Chicken Boy, he looks like a Chicken Boy.
I know this guy named Dave who looks just like a Harold. Every time I see him I go, "Hey Harold! How ya doin'?" 
And he says, "I'm not Harold. I'm Dave." And I'm like, "Oh Dave! I'm so sorry! I keep calling you Harold!" 
I'm so fucking stupid. 
I keep calling Dave Harold. But Chicken Boy, he looks like a Chicken Boy. His name is Chicken Boy. 
He is a chicken. 
He is a boy. 
It fits. 
Chicken Boy.
