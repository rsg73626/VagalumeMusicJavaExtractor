CLOWN NOSE

I'm frightened of the clown nose. 
It looks like it's getting bigger. 
I don't think there's any more room. It's got biceps like Schwarzenegger. 
We all fear the clown nose. Soon it will take over. 
It's red like the fires of Hell or the hat of Smokey Stover. Its big red shoes will stomp on your world. You soon will know the clown nose. 
Its tone will pierce your soul. Its grip will make sure you're free or fall forever though the nostril hole. 
I have become the clown nose. 
At last I understand. It talks in tongues. 
I hear it. 
Its wish is my command.
