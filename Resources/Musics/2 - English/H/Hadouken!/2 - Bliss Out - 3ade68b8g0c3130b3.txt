BLISS OUT

I'm on my way up
So high up now
I'm floating in the clouds
‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high off life
I'm floating in the clouds

Yea yea yea
So this is my weekend story
I won't fly the newly glory
Wake up, outside the rain is pouring
I don't care, I'm inside with you I'm sorry
Still sleeping nice and easy
It's origin, life is peachy
So sweet, heavy on my full stop weeks
That's how more I whips

Feels like I'm on the edge of a cloud
And only you can say it
Blissed out and I don't know how
How did you see clearly
And I love it when I see you over there

‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high up now
I'm floating in the clouds
‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high off life
I'm floating in the clouds

Feels like I'm on a rock point sittin
And I'm passed away in the bedroom tight and I'm
Livin, I wanna stay here forever
You make me rise when we come together
I'm lazy, mind is hazy
Just the way you send me crazy
Woke up in the middle of the night
Then you come down and the war is finals

Feels like I'm on the edge of a cloud
And only you can say it
Blissed out and I don't know how
How did you see clearly
And I love it when I see you over there

‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high up now
I'm floating in the clouds
‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high up now
I'm floating in the clouds

I'm on my way up
So high up now
I'm floating in the clouds
‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high off life
I'm floating in the clouds
‘Cause you make me bliss out
I'm on my way up
So high up now
I'm floating in the clouds
I'm on my way up
