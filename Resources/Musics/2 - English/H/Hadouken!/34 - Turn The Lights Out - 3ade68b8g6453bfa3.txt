TURN THE LIGHTS OUT

Turn the lights out, turn the lights out
Turn the lights out, turn the, turn the
Turn the lights out, turn the lights out
Turn the lights lights out

Make way for the ultraviolet, teenage riot, don't try it
You can't (stop this, stop this) You can't (stop this, stop this)
You see I'm lit like a molotov
Get out my way when the riot kicks off
You can't (stop this, stop this) You can't (stop this, stop this)

Get ready for the rough and tumble
If you wanna be starting something
You aint seen nothing yet, no you aint seen nothing
Push your way to the pit, stand tall raise your hands
If you wanna be starting something
You aint seen nothing yet, no you aint seen nothing

Turn the lights out, turn the lights out, turn the lights out

Make way for the bass
We fracture ribs and the dim when the sun comes in
(Go, go go go go go go go)
Make way for the drums
We pillar these beats so hard like concrete sheets
(Go, go go go go)

We lit the fuse and we're ready to blow
I don't care where we are, I don't care where we go
You better run from cover where the filaments go
I don't care where we are, I don't care where we go

This is your last chance boy, this is your last chance
This is your last chance, your last chance (x4)

Make way for the cardinal sin
When the boys come out when the freaks come in
(Go, go go go go go go go)
Make way for the horror show
If you wanna bring it then we'll come a loco
(Go, go go go go go go go)

We lit the fuse and we're ready to blow
I don't care where we are, I don't care where we go
You better run from cover where the filaments go
I don't care where we are, I don't care where we go

I don't care where we go
I don't care where we go

Turn the lights out (3x)
Turn the turn the
Turn the lights out (3x)
