LOVE SWEAT NAD BEARS

Let's Go....

At home on that friday night
and his weekends been made
because he's just been paid
he'll be out tonight
cuz it's a hadouken! gig
he's got his tickets and it's gona be big
gel on his hair and he's finally ready
his sheets are washed and his life ???
only 17 and he's up for the game
straight out the door
meet his boys on the train

What he don't know
is that She's on HER own
Cuz at the gig
hes gonna meet a girl
there gonna loose there mates
there gonna stay out late
Cuz he is lovin' the crowd.

BIG MUSIC YELL OUT VOLUMES
BLASTIN' OUT BEAR AND HORMONES
BRIGHT LIGHTS AND RIPPIN' GUITAR
THATS WHEN HE MET HER
AND HE SPOTTED THE CEILING
PARTY AND THE WAY HES FEELING
HE CRASHES OUT AND EVERYONES SCREAMING
THATS THEN WHEN SHE KISSED HIM.

at home on the early evening
She's getting dressed up
with her mates in the room
they simply farse what she's tryin' on
slaps on her nicest perfume
the girls tell her that she looks hot
they drink alcho pops and neck a few shots
time up and there ready to rock
the shops sells 20 they can buy FAGS from the shop

What he don't know
is that he's on his own
Cuz at the gig
hes gonna meet a girl
there gonna loose there mates
there gonna stay out late
Cuz he is lovin' the crowd.

BIG MUSIC GET OUT VOLUMES
BLASTIN' OUT BEAR AND HORMONES
BRIGHT LIGHTS AND RIPPIN' GUITAR
THATS WHEN HE MET HER
AND HE SPOTTED THE CEILING
PARTY AND THE WAY HES FEELING
HE CRASHES OUT AND EVERYONES SCREAMING
THATS THEN WHEN SHE KISSED HIM.

so there inside the venue
it's quarter past 8
got an hour till the band takes stage
she looks over and spots her boy
he's lost his mates and hes acting coy
sure the party won't great???
one hour and she lives with her mates
she walks over and she gets closer
he looks and turns and notices her...

(I'LL BE FINE)

THE LIGHTS GO DOWN
THE AIR IS THICK
I'LL SEARCH FOR WOOD
AND THE STARE IS SICK
SILHOUETTES APPEAR
THE CROWD ALL CHEER
IT FEELS LIKE THEY WHERE WAITING YEARS..
