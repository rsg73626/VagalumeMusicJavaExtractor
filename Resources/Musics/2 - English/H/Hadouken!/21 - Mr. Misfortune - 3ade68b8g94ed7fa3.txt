MR. MISFORTUNE

Come along mate,
You gotta cheer up,
I know down on your luck but,
Don't be down in the dumps,
Don't be down in the dumps,
Yeah don't be down in the dumps,
I know you're down on your luck but,
You got to listen up.

Coz real lads,
They don't sink,
They brush it off.
They hold up.
They take it on the chin.
And nice girls,
Won't leave you out of pocket,
Won't make you buy their mates all their drinks,
Then leave you there to sock it.

And OH OH OH OH!
He's only gone and done it.
She's dumped him again.
And OH OH OH OH!
He's only gone and done it again.

So tell it to me straight now,
Are you one of those guys,
Who always need the hassle and the stress in their lives?
And switches on and off from girlie to girl,
Misfortune always turning your world.

Mister Misfortune
We need to sort you,
(Check!).

And all our friends agree,
That since the age of fourteen,
You've played to lose and took the blues,
You need a slap on the cheek,
Coz now it's gone too far,
You need a swift reminder,
So lick your straightener scars,
And dry your eyeliner.

And OH OH OH OH!
He's only gone and done it.
She's dumped him again.
And OH OH OH OH!
He's only gone and done it again.

So tell it to me straight now,
Are you one of those guys,
Who always need the hassle and the stress in their lives?
And switches on and off from girlie to girl,
Misfortune always turning your world.

Mister Misfortune,
Mister Misfortune.
We need to sort you,
Mister Misfortune.

Don't be down in the dumps,
Don't be down in the dumps,
I know you're down on your luck but.

Don't be down in the dumps,
Don't be down in the dumps,
I know you're down on your luck but,
You got to listen up.

You got to listen up.

He's only gone and done it again.
