BAD SIGNAL

You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Where did we go wrong?)
Keep me hangin' on
Keep me hangin' on
(Cause you're giving me a bad signal)
Keep me hangin' on
Keep me hangin' on
Keep me hangin' on
Where did we go wrong?

It's been nearly a week
So now I'm thinking is it ever too late?
I didn't realize my heart could break
So easy from another status update
More days pass and then great
On my timeline up pops your face
No notifications babe
But I noticed all the tags you erased
Cause in my mind you're trending
And I wait and my hearts still pending
I see you there on my newsfeed
Don't leave me on voicemail please
All the boys you've friended
Seems like this contract's suspended
From the signal you are sending
Got a feeling this is ending

You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Cause you're giving me a bad signal)
You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Where did we go wrong?)

Three Am, drunk, I'm a mess
I'm sitting on the pavement alone
Should I send? Yes
Vomiting thoughts on the keypad
Send other drunken Sms
I'm foolish when I get pissed
Wake up read your inbox
You'll get the gist
I wore my heart on my wrist
To the girl that I love on my contacts list
Cause in my mind you're trending
And I wait and my hearts still pending
I see you there on my newsfeed
Don't leave me on voicemail please
All the boys you've friended
Seems like this contract's suspended
From the signal you are sending
Got a feeling this is ending

You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Cause you're giving me a bad signal)

You keep me hangin' on
(Cause you're giving me a bad signal)
You keep me hangin' on
Where did we go wrong?

You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Where did we go wrong?)
You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Cause you're giving me a bad signal)

You keep me hangin' on
(Cause you're giving me a bad signal)
You keep me hangin' on
Where did we go wrong?
