SUPERSTAR

Superstar

You Don't Like This Scene,
You Don't Like My Song,
Well If You Do,
Somewhere I've Done Something Wrong.
You Don't Like My Clothes,
Are My Jeans Too Tight?
Have I Ruined Your Gig?
Somewhere I've Done Something Right.

[Repeated]

I Know A Superstar,
Hes A Smart Kid, Real Hip, Real Cool,
Well Maybe Not An A-List Star,
In Fact This Kid Is A Class A Fool.
A Few Months Back Started Acting Keen,
Now He Reads ID Magazine,
Bought An Indie Fringe,
With Stubble On His Chin
And A Dick On His Head.

Its Not That I Don't Like Your Style,
Its Just Now You Act Like A Tool.
Maybe You Can Step Back For A While,
While Having A Smackstyle, Beat-Box School.
Will You Shoot This Fool
Because The World Doesn't Recognise
Your Fake ID,
And Will You Understand
With The Other 3 Pricks In Your Waistband

He Got His Clothes,
In A Retro Shop!
And He Looked Like A Million Bucks.
With Brand New Styles,
Such A Nice Haircut,
And Now Hes Got A Girl,
HE RULES THE WORLD!

Hes A Superstar!
HES A SUPERSTAR!
Hes A Superstar!

Go Back Where You Came From.
Start Back Where You Left Off.

So You've Just Done A Line
Heres News I Got For You Too
And Heres What I've Saved,
Lectures I've Got To Give To Boys Like You.
'You Treat Girls Like Shit
You Put On Your Front
And You Wear A Silk Scarf
AND YOUR SUCH A CUNT!'

Go Back Where You Came From.
Hes A Superstar!

You Don't Like This Scene,
You Don't Like My Song,
Well If You Do,
Somewhere I've Done Something Wrong.
You Don't Like My Clothes,
Are My Jeans Too Tight?
Have I Ruined Your Gig?
Somewhere I've Done Something Right.

So You've Got The Brains,
And You've Got The Looks,
AND THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU A STAR, LUKE!
You're Going To Be A Superstar!
You're Going To Be A Superstar!
He's A Superstar!
He's A Superstar!
