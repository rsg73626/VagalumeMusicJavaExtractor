M.A.D

We drop beats
That'll crack your cranium

Bring it on
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum

Bring it on
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum

We will play along
We will play along

Pop goes the pot its pandemonium
Poison the sushi with plutonium
We eat enriched uranium
We drop beats that'll crack your cranium

We call shots and the beats are rolling on
When the beats drop you'll get hold of em
Solder them
And we about to blow
With a fuck you fuck you ?? A comium

You wanna go son
You wanna go son
You wanna spar

You wanna go son
We can bang the drum at your door

You wanna go son
You wanna go son
You wanna spar

You wanna go son
We can bang the drum at your door

Bring it on
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum

Bring it on
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum

We will play along
We will play along

What've we started here
What've we done the outcome is always clear
The path choosed surely assured
Now what are you waiting for

Bring it on
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum

Bring it on
You can bang the drum, you can bang the drum

We will play along
