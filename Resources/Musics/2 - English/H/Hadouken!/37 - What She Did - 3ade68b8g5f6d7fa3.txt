WHAT SHE DID

I took a call in the night
She explained to me
It turned out i had been right
I told her i already knew

'Cuz you know
What i know
And i know
What you did

What ya did
What ya done
What ya said before
Got me high
Left me low
Now its nevermore
Honestly now you feed me your lies
What did ya think?
I got feelings, not feeling alright
In your head
You're not right!

Her taxi's waiting
Its dark now, raining
My eyes are stone cold
I told her to leave now

'Cuz you know
What i know
And i know
What you did

What ya did
What ya done
What ya said before
Got me high
Left me low
Now its nevermore
Honestly now you feed me your lies
What did ya think?
I got feelings, not feeling alright
In your head
You're not right!
