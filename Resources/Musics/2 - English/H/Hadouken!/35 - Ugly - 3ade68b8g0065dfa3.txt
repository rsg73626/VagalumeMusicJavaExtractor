UGLY

It's getting ugly

Ugly

You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin
Ooohh

I'm gonna fuck your face up
Break bones with this bass line
Break your nose with a faceplant
Don't care what i say ya

Fuck this place up
Land em low with a rizzlers roll
This stuffs gonna make you taste blood


Into the sonical warfare
Into the oral vortex
Gauge out balls with this flow
Out to the scum who called it
You might be on my case but
I can't take you straight
Tell that to my face boy
I'm gonna fuck your face up


It's ugly like your sister
As ugly as your sister
It's ugly like your sister
As ugly as your sister

You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin

It's getting ugly

It's ugly like your sister
It's ugly as your sister
It's ugly like your sister
It's ugly as your sister

You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin
You'll take it on the chin

It's getting ugly
