WAIT FOR YOU

(LalalalalalalalalalalalaÂ….)
And I will wait for you
And I will wait for you

I don't wanna be the boy who's always on he's own
I don't wanna wake you up so I'll sit here to dawn
I'm on my ownÂ…Â…. Its all gone wrong

And I'm waiting here but you're walking on
But you're walking on your stepping on
And I'm waiting here but you're walking on
But you're walking on your stepping on

And now when our paths they cross you try and walk on
And now when I call you on the phone you hang up
I saw you from the car I saw you walk in the door
It hasn't been the same since you tried ending it all

Now where've you gone, your bedroom light aint on,
I don't wanna stay too long
With my head in my palms and the handbrake on
Tell myself that it's all gone wrong
Now where've you gone, it's all gone wrong

And I'm waiting here but you're walking on
But you're walking on your stepping on
And I'm waiting here but you're walking on
But you're walking on your stepping on

And now when our paths they cross you try and walk on
And now when I call you on the phone you hang up
I saw you from the car I saw you walk in the door
It hasn't been the same since you tried ending it all

And I will wait for you
And I will wait for you

(Sorry the person you have called is unavailable)

And now when our paths they cross you try and walk on
And now when I call you on the phone you hang up
I saw you from the car I saw you walk in the door
It hasn't been the same since you tried ending it all

And now when our paths they cross you try and walk on
And now when I call you on the phone you hang up
I saw you from the car I saw you walk in the door
It hasn't been the same since you tried ending it all

And I will wait for you (lalalalalalaÂ…)
And I will wait for you (lalalalalalaÂ…)

Well I don't know what I'm doing here
Well I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know why I'm here
I will wait for you
