EVIL

Don't you feel alive
Don't you feel alive

I saw you take the path on the other side
Take the forward path for the second time
Been waiting for this moment
all my life

Listen, when I come from the rave
I go right from the stage
bustin my cup for the re-fill
I don't particulally like my peer view
You know we're not evil people
Bullshit sticks to a glorified equal
If somethings you've learnt from the free fall
Come back the second time, make it a sequel

We're just people, we're just buttons
Living our life in a circle
We play our cards and we have found
We lay our equals to the ground

No no no I won't go
no I won't go
no I wont go
no I won't
no

I can take your beating every once in a while
but I can't find the will to pluck up a smile
'cos I'm like a wheel
go round and round
I'm plugged in the speaker but can't make a sound

I won't go
no I won't go
wont go
no I won't go

no no, no I won't go
no I won't go
no I won't

WON'T GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WON'T GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I

WONT GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WONT

WONT GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WONT GO
NO I WONT
