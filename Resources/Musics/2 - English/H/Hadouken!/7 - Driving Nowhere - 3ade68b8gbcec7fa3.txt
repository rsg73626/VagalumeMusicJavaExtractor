DRIVING NOWHERE

She always seemed to lead him astray,
She'd filled his tank up for a trip on the dual carriageway,
In his enamoured state he'd always obey,
But yeah anyway,
She'd never leave his side,
Eyelids open wide,
Eyelids open wide,
He always relied.

She's done such bad things, yeah you must understand,
She's lost his house and friends,
She'd almost made him kill a man,
Always under his skin,
She'd taken cash from him,
(Still he took her back)

And they go out tonight,
He don't even know her,
She's taken him over,
And they go out tonight,
Driving to nowhere,

She sits there silent in the passenger seat,
Eyelids stiffened and arteries replete,
Condensation on windows,
He don't feel a thing no,
Feels nothing,

He gets pulled over by the cusp of the morning,
He doesn't flinch coz he lets her do the talking,
She's got a way with words,
And they got nothing on her,
So they carry on,

And they go out tonight,
He don't even know her,
She's taken him over,
And they go out tonight,
Driving to nowhere,

Take it away,
Said take it away,
Take it away,
Before the dusk turns to day,

I'm driving alone,
I can be strong on my own,
I can be strong on my own,
I can be strong on my...

And they go out tonight,
He don't even know her,
She's taken him over,
And they go out tonight,
Driving to nowhere,

And the journey alone ain't so appealing,
He's gone he's lost all feeling,
Driving to nowhere,
Driving to nowhere.
