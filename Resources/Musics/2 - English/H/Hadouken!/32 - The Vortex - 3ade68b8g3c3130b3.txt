THE VORTEX

Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
Don't worry, I don't wanna worry

Welcome to the birth of a storm
It's another hurricane tornado warning
Tension swelling, bodies are swarming
There's no escape from the vortex forming
Like eight drums colliding
Like dictators inside and violence
And I'm just spilling with verses
Like cypher really in curses
Best of the worse kind

Each and every weekend
We spend it like the whole world's ending
Each and every weekend
Let the whole world know how we like to spend it

Welcome to the birth of a vortex
It's a new drop so it's contortion
Forcing in another hurricane caution
So awesome just leave to the caution
Just about to get violent
Take the sirens off silent striding
On the last burn of a high street ride
Your paycheck is just how we like it

Each and every weekend
We spend it like the whole world's ending
Each and every weekend
Let the whole world know how we like to spend it

Each and every weekend
We spend it like the whole world's ending
Each and every weekend
Let the whole world know how we like to spend it

So rush out
It's clear to walk my friend
And you'll find the now in the vortex you are today
Jump in the vortex!

Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
Don't worry, I don't wanna worry
