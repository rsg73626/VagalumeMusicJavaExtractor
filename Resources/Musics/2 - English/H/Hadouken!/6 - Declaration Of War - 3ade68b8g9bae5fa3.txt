DECLARATION OF WAR

I'm walking hunted (wounded?) on the ground 
But I will stand here tall 
Well I will stand here tall 

Well if you want war with me 
If you want war with me 
If you want war with me, then bring on beef 
If you want war with me 
If you want war then you got war. 

You try to rip me but I don't tear and I don't care 
My skin is thicked out, our love was lost years before (?) 
This time I'm ready for your war 
But now I'm ready for your war 

I should have put this flame out years ago 
but you burnt my house down, I won't leave 
and if I stand here alone in this dust I've got nothing left to lose 
nothing left to lose 

Cuz I see your ways and I know your plan 
cuz you've been around and I've seen this place before 
I won't do this anymore 
but if you want war, you got war 

So bring your friends out, I'll take my place and you take yours 
and launch your guts out but will the parents (?) let us war 
I should have seen this years before 
but now I'm ready for your war 

I should have crossed these borders years ago 
but you left me somewhere I don't know (?) 
and as I stand here in no-mans land 
I contemplate your attack 

Cuz I see your ways and I know your plan 
cuz you've been around and I've seen this place before 
I won't do this anymore 
but if you want war, you got war 

You can try and hurt me 
I'll come back for more 

Cuz I see your ways and I know your plan 
cuz you've been around and I've seen this place before 
I won't do this anymore 
but if you want war, you got war 

Cuz I see your ways and I know your plan 
cuz you've been around and I've seen this place before 
I won't do this anymore 
but if you want war, you got war
