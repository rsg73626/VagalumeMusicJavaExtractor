MECHA LOVE

Remember in days gone past
I spied you through a wall of glass
And there you were, kicking my heart back and forth.
But now your not so tough.

You wanted the world
You wanted it all
You wanted the world
You wanted it all
You wanted the world
You wanted it all
You wanted the world

So here it is, the planets cried.
We'll rip the still sky.
Make way when walls collide.
I know what heart but still will reconcile your mecha love.
You hold your thought so tall
You think you've got it all

You wont break a lie
I will never surrender

Take a walk
So this is the last stand
So this is your last chance
So this is your last

You wanted the world
You wanted it all

As I ready for war,
My exoskeleton,
I'm not a passenger, I am the carrier.
I know this vessel will withstand I love your mecha love
I've got you figured out
I've got you figured out

You wont break a lie
I will never surrender

Take a walk
So this is your last stand
So this is your last chance
So this is your last

You wanted the world
You wanted it all
You wanted the world
You wanted it all
