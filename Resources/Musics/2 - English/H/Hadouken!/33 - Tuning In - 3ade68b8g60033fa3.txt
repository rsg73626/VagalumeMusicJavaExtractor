So I'm seen* in some trendy bar
with a girl who i met through my mate Char-lott
she's a bit of a sort, everything was cool until we talked
now she didn't offend me, but her chat was proper empty
i realised the girl i'm *scoring*
is fit but fucking boring
and i'm nearly snoring
because she goes on and on
about her boresome family
and the village she is from
and she's studying maths
her favourite colour is black
and she's a terrible cook
and-i can't help from staring at her rack

cos i'm listening
yeah-i'm tuning in!
cos what you say is really interesting (yeah!)
cos i'm tuning in
yeah-i'm zooming in!
cos when you talk i really do listen

so we get onto this conversation it was oh so fun
and when she finished i downed another drink of coke and rum
i got a toilet break and had a cheeky fag
she went when i came back i had to guard her bag
-if you come home with me i work all you need
cos i've got a myspace and i don't mind we can walk at your pace
if you wanna stay the night then it really is alright
cos theres enough space and i really think that you'd like my place

cos i'm listening
yeah-i'm tuning in!
cos what you say is really interesting (yeah!)
cos i'm tuning in
yeah-i'm zooming in!
cos when you talk i really do listen (honest!)

*Snoring*

yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah yeah yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
yeah, yeah, ok-ok, uhuh but, yeah yeah yeah

So i asked her what music she liked
- A bit of everything really
I asked her be more specific, but she can't answer my query
ok thats enough, i've heard enough mindless chat
i need to curb on the bullshit and get her back to my flat
- girl i've heard enough, you talk about such wanton stuff
cos i've got a myspace and i don't mind we can walk at your pace
- i've sat right here polite, lets go back now i'm borderline
cos theres enough space and i really think that you'd like my place

*Intro in background*

cos i'm listening
yeah-i'm tuning in!
cos what you say is really interesting (yeah!)
cos i'm tuning in
yeah-i'm zooming in!
