HOUSE IS FALLING DOWN

House is falling
House is falling
House is falling
Down

I am a victim of you
And your misery
I feel resentment in my blood
Oh how the wounds are so deep
Theres nowhere to hide
And for between misery
Behind and blind is where you want us to be

Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?

Do you know you're breaking on me?

House is falling
House is falling
House is falling
House is falling
House is falling
House is falling
House is falling
House is falling

I'm left on my own every week
I wake up sweating in my sleep
We have to break down all the walls
You must dissolve this palacey

Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
Do you know you're breaking on me?
