PRAYER

Get on the dancefloor,
Yeah, its Hadouken!
Remix your brain,
Yeah, remix your game.

That's right yeah, Im unstoppable,
Get in my way you get kicked like a soccerball,
You What? You What?
Okay, lets go, lets go, lets go.

If you wont dance then get out, get out,
And if you cant sing them shout like me,
If you've got a drink then neck the whole cup,
If you don't know the words then just make them up.

Volume is all it takes,
Make some noise, wake up your flatmates,
Play this loud out your window,
Earn yourself your first asbo.

Lord, give me grace and dancing feet and the power to impress.

That's right yeah, Im unstoppable,
Get in my way you get kicked like a soccerball.

Lord, give me grace and dancing feet,
Let me outshine them all.
You What? You What?
TAKE IT TO THE CHORUS!

Tonight make me unstoppable,
I will charm, I will slice, I will dazzle them with my wit,

That's right yeah, Im unstoppable,
Get in my way you get kicked like a soccerball,
Fix up cause now im hear,
Poking your brain like I'm raping your ear,

Is it so wrong to crave recognition?
Second best, runner up.
Is it so wrong to want rewarded, to want more than is given to you?

See, I've got this alter ego, looks like James but its not quite me though.
He's evil, so I'm sick when I'm 'ere,
So the crowd at the front get covered in vomit.
Nasty! I'm not hear to please ya,
I spit blood and guts like a Pok√©mon seizure,
Kids, you can be sick like me,
Just drop an acid tab in Grandma's tea.

If you wont dance then get out, get out,
And if you cant sing them shout like me,
If youve got a drink then neck the whole cup,
If you don't know the words then just make them up,
Volume is all it takes,
Make some noise, wake up your flatmates,
Play this loud out your window,
Earn yourself your first ASBO,
TAKE IT TO THE CHORUS!

Tonight make me unstoppable,

That's right yeah, Im unstoppable.
Get in my way you get kicked like a soccerball.
Fix up cause now im hear, poking your brain like I'm raping your ear.
I will chop, I will slice, I will dazzle them with my wit.

I reference ASBOs, I've got such wit.
The Guardian's just gonna love this shit.
Such a shame 'cause grime's gonna hate it,
And this tracks so short!
