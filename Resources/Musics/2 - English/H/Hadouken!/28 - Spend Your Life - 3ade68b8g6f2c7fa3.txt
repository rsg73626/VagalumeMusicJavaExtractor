SPEND YOUR LIFE

Listen I've got a bit of fiscal trouble
I don't wanna sob but I need a few bob
In the last year I've seen my debt double 
And I can't pay it back coz I ain't got a job
It must have been the small print I misunderstood
The offer on the leaflet looked so good
I was poor, my motor was rusting
The man on the advert looked so trusting

Isn't it funny how people spend their life away?
Buy now pay later then consolidate your life 
On daytime telly the trusted man brings peace of mind
And a lifeline for those who don't work
And isn't it funny how people live a life of debt 
To a person that they have never met
On a leaflet just sign on the dotted line
Stay in the red till the day that you're dead

I'm drowning deep in debt
And all I do is spend spend spend
I can't afford the life so why'd they let me lend again
I can't bank on a credit culture life of greed 
I don't know how I'll cope with mortgages and mouths to feed

Isn't it funny how people spend their life away?
Buy now pay later then consolidate your life 
On daytime telly the trusted man brings peace of mind
And a lifeline for those who don't work
And isn't it funny how people live a life of debt 
To a person that they have never met
On a leaflet just sign on the dotted line
Stay in the red till the day that you're dead

Listen I've got a bit of fiscal trouble

And I can't pay it back coz I ain't got a job
It must have been the small print I misunderstood
The offer on the leaflet looked so good
I was poor, my motor was rusting
The man on the advert looked so trusting

Isn't it so funny how we people spend our life away?
Isn't it so funny how we people spend our life away?

Isn't it funny how people spend their life away?
Buy now pay later then consolidate your life 
On daytime telly the trusted man brings peace of mind
And a lifeline for those who don't work
And isn't it funny how people live a life of debt 
To a person that they have never met

Stay in the red till the day that you're dead
