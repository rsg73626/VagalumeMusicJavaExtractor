LEVITATE

Heart in my mouth but, my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
I'm realizing

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays, I close my eyes and
Levitate (levitate, levitate, ...)

I jacks on

The jump is eletric, the high is a scent
I can feel it charging
I'll never forget, we transcending
I don't know we've started

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate (Levitate!)
With every chord that plays, I close my eyes and
Levitate (levitate, levitate...)
I levitate (levitate, levitate...)

Heart in my mouth but, my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
I'm realizing

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays, I close my eyes and
Levitate (levitate, levitate...)

I jacks on

I can levitate
I can levitate

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays, I close my eyes and
Levitate (levitate, levitate...)
I leviate (levitate. levitate, ...)
