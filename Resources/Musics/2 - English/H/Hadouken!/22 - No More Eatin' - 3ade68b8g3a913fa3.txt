it started when i was 8
first time i ever got 8
what a piece of cake
mans eating of me like i was a plate
now im in a state
walkin the streets of gate
with eyes of merd
with tears stream down my bloodshot face
coz some irish kid took my bike away

turn the page 6 years late
and now im 14 years of age
lifes a daze so my brain
smoking to much purple haze
thats how i spent my dayz
til i prove to snap
coz im holdin it down at school
on the streets im still gettin jacked
still gettin attacked
and thats why i cant find the balls
to hit um back
hit um back
eat up these cats like
i eat up the track
its only when i turned 16
that i start facin facts
so i had a weed named yack
kicked the habbit
like it was laced with crack

i know this kid
on my estate
got no habit
and he likes to take
he jacks kids at the local park
works all the time
when it gets dark
no-one screws and
no-one moans
so he takes ipods and video phones
and we have to stop
this silence
so i might advocate in violence

im a vigilante boy
and i wont let the big boys take my toys
he tried to take whats mine
when we was standing outside (?)
big mistake cos i brought the beef
and this (?) shoulda ducked
i pushed a brick to his teeth
and now his face is fucked

hit the road jack
you've gotta hit em back
You go pow, they go ow
no more eatin for them now

you've gotta hit em back
give that boy a smack
this is how, pow!
no more eatin for them now

Im 19 years to the day
And its been 3 since someone tried it
As soon as they do im gonna knock there lights out
like they were ultraviolet
They got there eyes on my stash
But trying to hide it
They know im making cash
Though i look brassed
Cos i try to keep it quiet

But i shot the his pen
It aint no secret
And given half a chance yo half these cats will wanna eat
Plus they know that i dont get high
So my supply builds up their appetite
And now they wanna feed it
Take me for a fucking egit

No more eatin for you now x6
Gotta hit em back

Your with me it was gonna happen
So when it did i beat the kid
Till he was blue n black n
told him who you think your jacking
Packed a punch, yes a punch thats what i was packing
Hit the fucking cunt so hard, hed already started bloodin'
Before he hit the floor like a sack o' pototoes
Face plant, knocked the teeth right out of his cakehole
And sent him on his way yo, but one was thing to say though
Thought I was something to eat up, you made a mistake bro

hit the road jack

You go pow, they go ow
