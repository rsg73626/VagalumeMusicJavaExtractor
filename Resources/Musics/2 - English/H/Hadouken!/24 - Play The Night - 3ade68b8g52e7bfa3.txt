PLAY THE NIGHT

Theres no morning in sight
We hear the beat and play the night

Theres no morning in sight
We hear the beat and play the night

Theres no morning in sight
We hear the beat and play the night

Theres no morning in sight (echo)

GET FUCKED
GET FUCKED UP
JUMP UP
GET FUCKED
GET FUCKED UP
JUMPED UP

You gotta voice, resite that
If you got a lighter, light that
Twist it, when you hear the film come
Turn your back, when you see the first sun
Don't stop, give it in despite that
Your gonna play the night here
We got one more hour
Man your tower
You can fight that

Fade away, we fade to grey (x4)

GET FUCKED
GET FUCKED UP
JUMP UP
GET FUCKED
GET FUCKED UP
JUMPED UP

Help, we're burning out
and my eyes are full
as the glare burns deep down
Help, we're burning out
We retract these walls
As the heros fall

Fade away, we fade to grey.(x8)

ooooooooooooooooooo...
ooooooooooooooooooo...
ooooooooooooooooooo...

Fade away, we fade to grey(x7)
