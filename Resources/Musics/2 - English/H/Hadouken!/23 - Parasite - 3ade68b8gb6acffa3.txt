PARASITE

No longer one,
Not symbiotic.
It's all I have,
I gave you everything.
Take what you want,
Then neutralise it.
It's all I have,
I gave you everything.

Take all you want from me,
Take all you need from me.
I took a step back, now I realise,
I'm being consumed by a parasite!

Half of me is half of you,
Half of me is half of you.
Take all you want from me,
Take all you need from me.
Before my eyes,
Then I realise,
I'm being comnsumed by a parasite!
Oh

But I won't fall this time,
And thats the thing,
You won't get everything.
You sap my life,
But I won't fall this time,
This parasite!
Is still alive!

Uh!

This parasite!
Is still alive!
Oh


But I won't fall this time,
And that's the thing,
You won't get everything.
You sap my life,
But I won't fall this time,
This parasite!
Is still alive!
(Jump!)

Uh!

Before my eyes,
Then I realise,
I'm being consumed by a parasite!
Oh

But I won't fall this time,
And that's the thing,
You won't get everything.
You sap my life,
But I won't fall this time,
This parasite!
Is still alive!

Uh!

A parasite!

Take all you want from me,
Take all you need from me.

This parasite!
Is still alive!
