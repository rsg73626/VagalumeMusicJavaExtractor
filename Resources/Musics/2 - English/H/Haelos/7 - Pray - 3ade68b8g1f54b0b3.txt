PRAY

Well, you just can't hold the heist
Like sunday skies
And broken rhymes
Run out of love, lost our way
To pass the clouds
And rolling waves
Pray don't fall down
Pray don't fall down
Pray don't fall down
Pre-pre- pray don't fall down
When all the hope fades around
Embrace your soul
From dusty ground
Stuck in reverse, the record won't play
The ending fades
Unbroken days

Pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
Pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
Pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
Pre-pre- pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)

Pre-pre- pray don't fall down
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)
(pre-pre- pray don't fall down)

Pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
Pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
Pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
Pre-pre- pray don't fall down
(pray don't fall down)
