ORACLE

Hear me out
Watch as the sky falls down
Dissolve under caustic cloud
Spin as the world goes round

Savour the calm
Savour the calm
For your salvation
Savour the calm

Senseless sick
Caught up in politick
Spend my time out of it
Spin as the world goes round

Savour the calm
Savour the calm
For your salvation
Savour the calm
