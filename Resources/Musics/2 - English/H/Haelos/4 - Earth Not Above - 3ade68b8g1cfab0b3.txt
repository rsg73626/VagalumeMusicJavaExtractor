EARTH NOT ABOVE

Some of us need kindness
An act that we learn
A sun from the wasteland, calling
Bringing us back home
Shadows will guide us
Show us what's true
Thoughts of the garden calling
I faded out too soon

Is this is what we have become?
Is this is what we have become?

Clear from the silence
Like finding out you know
Sight from the blindness, drawing, closer
Futures we own
It brings us back home

Is this is what we have become?
Is this is what we have become?
Is this is what we have become?
Is this is what we have become?

Some people need healing
Some people need love
Some die for the feeling
From Earth not above
Some people need healing
Some people need love
Some die for the feeling
From Earth not above
