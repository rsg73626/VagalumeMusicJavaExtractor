DUST

Still
The space and the time
Doesn't it flow like
Shadows entwined
Forget about us
Alone on the mountain
Lost to the sound

I can't feel enough
To be the weight of us
I can't feel enough
I can't feel enough
To keep this wasted love
I can't feel enough

This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine

Come
The lepoard and lace
The faces that tore me
Keep guarding my way
What happened to us?
Torn from the moment
Of weeping in dust

I can't feel enough
To be the weight of us
I can't feel enough
I can't feel enough
To keep this wasted love
I can't feel enough

I can't feel enough
To be the weight of us
I can't feel enough
I can't feel enough
To keep this wasted love
I can't feel enough

This old love, you know now
(I can't feel enough)
It's not over
Just go now
(I can't feel enough)
What goes 'round
Comes back around

This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine

This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
This love ain't mine
