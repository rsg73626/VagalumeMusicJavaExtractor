ALONE

I don't belong
Slowly slip back inside of my mind
Where the weather's warm
Shielding me from all judgmental eyes

So I won't lie to you
Because I know what love is
And that's why ours is good
No I won't lie to you
Because I know what love is
And that's why ours is good

Desire
With folded wings
Safe here from the silhouettes behind
The dreams that we spin
Leave no ripples or no trace or sign

So I won't lie to you
Because I know what love is
Because I know what love is
And that's why ours is good
No I won't lie to you
Because I know what love is
Because I know what love is
And that's why ours is good

[Outro x3]
Never be alone
Never speak alone
Never drink alone
Never feel alone

Because I know what love is
Know what love is, know what love I
