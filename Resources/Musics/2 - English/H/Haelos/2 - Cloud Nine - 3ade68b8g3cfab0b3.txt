CLOUD NINE

Hey there's our heaven dissolving
Some broken universe unfolding

Foreign futures by night
Lit by distant insight

You took all of
You took all of my faith
And there's no sense here
Just so empty this space
You took all my
You took all of my faith
There's no waking here
There's no air in this place

Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?

Black bliss for comfort
Reason fading
Same dark euphoric recall lately

Foreign futures by night
Lit by distant insight

You took all of
You took all of my faith
And there's no sense here
Just so empty this space
You took all my
You took all of my faith
There's no waking here
There's no air in this place

Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?

Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?
Why did you leave me here?
