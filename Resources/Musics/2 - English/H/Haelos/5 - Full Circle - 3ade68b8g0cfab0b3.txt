FULL CIRCLE

We've come full circle
Like a serpent coiling no end
Just the same mad circus
Wait
For blood to blossom
The saints and soulless to mend
Like we've all forgotten again

Round again
Coming round again

Colours in my head
You

If my heart's sinking
Then I'll walk this waste land again
In some dead bar drinking
Used to be so simple my friend

Round again
Coming round again

These colours in my head
You
