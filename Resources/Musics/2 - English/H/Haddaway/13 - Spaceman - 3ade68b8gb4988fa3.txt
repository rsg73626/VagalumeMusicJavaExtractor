SPACEMAN

Know this man hanging out in space
Living together with a man in space
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Venus shines every day and night
Living with her just feels right
Somebody told me
Somebody told me

Cuz living out here is not so bad
The ladies I know always turn me in circles
Turn me in circles

Spaceman, touchdown, come around
What you do, and what you found out there
There's somebody out there
Spaceman, touchdown, come around
What you do, and what you found out there
There's somebody out there

Titan's new giving us new light
The voice from Earth, looking for life
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Pluto's flying alone out there
Little by little, man wants to care
Somebody told me
Somebody told me

Cuz living out here is not so bad
The ladies I know always turn me in circles
Turn me in circles

Spaceman, touchdown, come around
What you do, and what you found out there
There's somebody out there
Spaceman, touchdown, come around
What you do, and what you found out there
There's somebody out there

Are you gonna wait for me 
Tonight
Mars will give us light to see
So bright
Guide me to the clouds
The Earth
The Moon
The sea
To you now

Spaceman, touchdown, come around
What you do, and what you found out there
There's somebody out there (What you found out)
Spaceman, touchdown, come around
What you do, and what you found out there
There's somebody out there (What you found out there

(repeat to fade)
