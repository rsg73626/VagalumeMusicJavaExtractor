TOUCH

Touch,  
When I need you, you're there.  
Touch,  
You can drive me to despair.  
Hey,  
I spent hours by the phone  
Just to hear from you,  
Why don't I hear from you?  
  
I call you every day,  
I call you every night,  
'cause something on my mind just don't feel right.  
Maybe I am wrong  
and maybe it's tonight,  
But something in your eyes tells me something's just not right,  
Something's not right.  
  
Touch,  
You got a lot of things to do,  
Oh but touch,  
That don't make me blue,  
But hey,  
I spent hours by the phone  
To get an answer from you,  
  
Though I call you every day,  
I call you every night,  
'cause something on my mind just don't feel right,  
Something's not right.  
  
So tell me why you never care about what i do  
and leave me here in my despair,  
I feel a lot of despair.  
  
I call you every day,    
I call you every night,    
'cause something on my mind just don't feel right.    
Maybe I am wrong    
and maybe it's tonight,    
But something in your eyes tells me something's just not right,    
Something's not right.
