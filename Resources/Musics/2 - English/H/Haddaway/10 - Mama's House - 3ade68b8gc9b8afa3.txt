MAMA'S HOUSE

Get up; get up
Oh yeah, Oh

Now I can show you
Life's not lonely
And I can take your fears away
Even the darkest heart has a heart
Should I show you where you're going to find out

Just go to Mama's house
She'll show you the right way
Go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house

Oh you're unhappy
You feel you're the only one
But the people brought their lies away
Scenes of a broken heart, shows of mistake
When I play the part you don't have paid

Just go to Mama's house
She'll show you the right way
Go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house

When you world is thieving
And when your heart's not sharing
And you need some love

Just go to Mama's house
She'll show you the right way
Go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house

Just go to Mama's house
She'll show you the right way
Go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house

Just go to Mama's house
She'll show you the right way
Go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house
Just go to Mama's house
