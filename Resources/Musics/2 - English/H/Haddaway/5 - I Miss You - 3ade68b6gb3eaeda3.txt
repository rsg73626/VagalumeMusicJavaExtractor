I MISS YOU

I know if you could hear me 
You'd say there's always two sides for every story
Here's mine, I found out
I can't live without you

Loving you was easy,
And being true was hard,
One two many lies and you were gone
I didn't wanna face up to the things I've done
I thought I'd be alright but I was wrong

(chorus)
I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say

Saying that I'm sorry isn't good enough
I need to show you just how much I've changed
'Cause girl if you could see what I'm going through
You wouldn't be afraid to try again

(chorus)
I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say

I miss you... I miss you...

I'm gonna need you...

I miss you, more than words can say

(chorus)
I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say
