MAKE ME BELIEVE

Make me believe  
  
You don't know why  
after all you meant to me  
I'd wanna leave so easily  
and say goodbye.  
  
You did me wrong,  
You let your heart go out to play  
and now you want my love to stay.  
  
And I would die  
If I walked away from you.  
  
Make me believe in you,  
Look in my eyes.  
Make me believe in you,  
Tell me no lies.  
  
They say that time  
Can help to mend a broken heart  
Like the one you tore apart,  
Tell me no lies.  
  
(But) I realize  
Time itself don't mean a thing  
Without you right here with me.  
  
'cause I would die  
If I walked away from you.
