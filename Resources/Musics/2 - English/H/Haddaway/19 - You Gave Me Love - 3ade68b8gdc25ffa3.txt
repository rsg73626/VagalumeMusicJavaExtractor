YOU GAVE ME LOVE

You gave me love, don't leave me this way
You keep me awake all night and day
You gave me love, you gave me love,
You gave me love, you gave me love,

Whenever I'm laying with you
Whenever you will say you leaving me
Whatever I was giving you
When never ever mother
My mama's had a toothache
And I don't know what to do
'cause this thing has really happened
She's got a sexy body, my friends all say she's hot
...really tru, so I'm sorry

You gave me love, don't leave me this way
You keep me awake all night and day
You gave me love, don't leave me this way
I'll be keeping inside my heart this pain
You gave me love,you gave me love,
No matter what I meant to you
Or even when you say you needed me

Whenever I was keeping you
If it doesn't really matter
You gave me love, don't leave me this way
You keep me awake all night and day
You gave me love, don't leave me this way
I'll be keeping inside my heart this pain

You gave me love,you gave me love,
You gave me love,you gave me love,
You gave me love, don't leave me this way
You keep me awake all night and day
You gave me love, don't leave me this way
You keep me awake all night and day
Only you baby ...yeah
You gave me love
