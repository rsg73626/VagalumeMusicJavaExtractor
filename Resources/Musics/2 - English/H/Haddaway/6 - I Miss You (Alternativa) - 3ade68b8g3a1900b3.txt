I MISS YOU (ALTERNATIVA)

I know if you could hear me you would 
Say there are always two sides of a story 
You're so right, here's mine 
I cannot live without you 

Love was never easy, 
But leaving you was hard, 
And time didn't heal my wounds at all 
I wonder, if you know what I'm going through 
All the lonely times that we're apart 

Chorus: 
I miss you, oh I miss you 
I'm gonna need you more and more each day 
I miss you, more than words can say 
More than words can ever say 

Saying sorry was a question of my pride 
Pride can push aside a loving heart, 
In the end emotion has ruled my mind 
And I'm asking for a second start 

Chorus 

Maybe I've said words that really didn't 
mean, but I know, every day 
When a man does wrong 
I know I miss you
