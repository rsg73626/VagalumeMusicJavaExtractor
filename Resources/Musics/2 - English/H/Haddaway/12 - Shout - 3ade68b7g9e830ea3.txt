SHOUT

Feel the rhythm
Deep inside my soul
Feel the rhythm of my love
I want you

Revelation
Absolutely stalls
When you're giving it to me
You make me

Shout, shout
Baby if you'd rather moan
Shout, shout
Baby if you'd rather moan

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

In the mirror
You can see my face
You know what you do to me
You make me

Shout, shout
Baby if you'd rather moan
Shout, shout
Baby if you'd rather moan

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Yeah

Shout, shout
Shout, shout
Shout, shout
Baby if you'd rather moan

Stay with me
Stay with me

Shout
