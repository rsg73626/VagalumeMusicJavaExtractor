Back to the 90's 
Yes, we love the 90's 
Rhythm is a dancer, It's my life 
I sing hallelujah, what is love 
In the middle of the night 
All that she wants is pop

How many times did you ever recall 
The special voices of the 90's show 
Forget those faces that we never ???

Jump around, jump around, jump around in a slow motion! 
Haddaway and Dr. Alban in a cool colaboration.
