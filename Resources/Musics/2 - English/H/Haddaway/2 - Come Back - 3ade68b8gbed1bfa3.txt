COME BACK

I stay 
I decide 
I never wanted to see your face again 
But when you passed me by 
I was back on fire 

Love 
Love has got a hold of me 
(Baby just can't you see) 
Love 
Love has got a hold of me (hold of me) 
Come back 

Since I closed my eyes and 
Made a picture of you in my mind 
My love is eating me 
I want you by my side 

Love 
Love has got a hold of me 
(Baby just can't you see) 
Love 
Love has got a hold of me (hold of me) 
Come back 

(oh, come back) 
(oh, come back) 
Come back 
Come back 

Love (love) 
Love has got a hold of me 
(Baby just can't you see) 
Love (love) 
Love has got a hold of me (hold of me) 
Love 
Love has, love has 
Love has, love has got a hold of me 
Come back...
