SEND MORE PARAMEDICS

My blood moves due to these machines
Quietly living in wires
I call to you through these lcd's
Look what our lies have transpired
Focus. promise.
I never meant for you.
I never meant for anyone to...
I've seen better days

Before we lose control,
Be sure to let the paramedics know
To cut away what's not critical
First check your pulse and then commit
Breath to your lungs, whats left of them
I must have wanted this
I'm sorry that I dream it

Do you wish that I stay asleep
Hiding the truth in my dreams
My lips will not pass your secret on
Against my will it's safe with me

Focus. promise.
I promised everyone I know.
I am home.
I promised everyone I love

Before we lose control,
Be sure to let the paramedics know
To cut away what's not critical
First check your pulse and then commit
Breath to your lungs, what's left of them
I must have wanted this
I'm sorry that I dream it

Don't wait here until we bleed out
It's not that hard. I've come too far
To turn this ship around
Don't worry, about me
You take the pieces that you know,
I'll take the pieces that don't fit (kyle sings, brad screams)
I'll focus, I promise
I promised everyone I know,
I promised everyone I love (brad sings, kyle screams)

Before we lose control,
Be sure to let the paramedics know
To cut away what's not critical
First check your pulse and then commit
Breath to your lungs, what's left of them
I must have wanted this
I'm sorry that I dream it

Before we lose control,
Be sure to let the paramedics know
To cut away, cut away, love
First check your pulse and then commit
Breath to your lungs, but don't forget
I must have wanted this
I'm sorry that I dream it
