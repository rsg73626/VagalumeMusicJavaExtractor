AN ANTHEM FOR LOST FRIENDS

Prove to me that you're still there
And I'll follow you
Yeah, you can lead me anywhere
I write to keep you to myself
I tried so hard I split my lip and drowned in blood
My love, no one cares to know that I miss you

Now this will never end, I learned this all from you
No one, no one cares to know I miss you

Everything you said I did, I didn't mean
I took it back for you once but never again,
Never again, never again, well I told you
Everything you said I did, I didn't mean
I took it back for you once but never again,
Never again, never again

Save a life like you know how
And I will believe you
I will believe anything
I tried to keep this to myself
I cried for you and told your friends what I had done
My love, they told me no one would miss you

Now this will never end. I learned this all from you.
No one, no one cares to know I miss you.

Everything you said I did, I didn't mean
I took it back for you once but never again,
Never again, never again, well I told you
Everything you said I did, I didn't mean
I took it back for you once but never again,
Never again, never again

I'll catch this spark and relight your fire
I'll catch this spark and relight your fire
Yes I will. I will, always

Now this will never end. I learned this all from you.
No one, no one cares to know I miss you.

Everything you said I did, I didn't mean
I took it back for you once but never again,
Never again, never again, well I told you
Everything you said I did, I didn't mean
I took it back for you once but never again,
Never again, never again
