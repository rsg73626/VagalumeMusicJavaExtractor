THEY CALL US THIEVES

Tell me everything I need to know to believe in.
I don't believe, I can't believe, I don't believe I'm breathing

Bring it down
Your voice is too loud
It carries secrets to their ears
Don't bring it up again
If you bring it up again
They'll put us straight into the ground

And I hope we win them over
We can head straight for the door
No matter where this goes, (all the way back home)
If it's all the same I'd like to go home

Tell me everything I need to know, about you
Because they're coming, because they're coming, and I don't know what they'll do
Tell me everything I need to know
I don't believe, I can't believe, I don't believe I'm breathing

They call us thieves
Call us anything to take the pressure off themselves
It's not your blood I want
For all those things you've done
I just wanna see you in hell
And you saved me miles and miles
Of tracks and heart attacks and bodybags
And countless hours I will never spend

And I hope we win them over
We can head straight for the door
No matter where this goes, (all the way back home)
If it's all the same I'd like to go home

Tell me everything I need to know, about you
Because they're coming, because they're coming, and I don't know what they'll do
Tell me everything I need to know
I don't believe, I can't believe, I don't believe I'm breathing

These stories, like accurate corpses
Creep out of their coffins and on to my front door and now
You've never been this simple, a cemetery sun sets on us both
I've never been this desperate, or dangerous. I'll lie here waiting

No matter where this goes, if it's all the same I'd like to go home
Carry me
No matter where you are
It's all the same, it's all the same now

Tell me everything I need to know, about you
Because they're coming, because they're coming, and I don't know what they'll do
Tell me everything I need to know
I don't believe, I can't believe, I don't believe I'm breathing
