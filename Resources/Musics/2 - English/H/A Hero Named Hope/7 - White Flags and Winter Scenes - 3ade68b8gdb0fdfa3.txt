WHITE FLAGS AND WINTER SCENES

To you he is like winter, cold but still alive
With softly spoken whispers that keep you up at night
And still it makes you wonder will both of you last the night
Will everything be all right?

Now these days turn to weeks so fast he can't keep
Up with your heartbeats dying
Your eyes bring razorblades that cut cut cut me so deep
White flags go up and I won't keep fighting

You can tell me when you've had enough
The sunrise paralyzes all I've come to love
Oh you swear, you swear the phone is broken, but I know
It's over, it's over, your intentions

Now these days turn to weeks so fast he can't keep
Up with your heartbeats dying
Your eyes bring razorblades that cut cut cut me so deep
White flags go up and I won't keep fighting

It takes her breath away. this is war she doesn't know another way
It takes her breath away. this is war she doesn't know another way

This is war she doesn't know another way

Now these days turn to weeks so fast he can't keep
Up with your heartbeats dying
Your eyes bring razorblades that cut cut cut me so deep
White flags go up and I won't keep fighting

Your eyes bring razorblades that cut cut cut me so deep
My eyes roll up and I won't keep fighting
Your eyes bring razorblades that cut cut cut me so deep
My eyes roll up and I won't keep fighting
