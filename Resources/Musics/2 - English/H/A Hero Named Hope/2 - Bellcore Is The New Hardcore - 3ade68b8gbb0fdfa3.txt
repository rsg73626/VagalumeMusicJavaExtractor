BELLCORE IS THE NEW HARDCORE

Take me back for one last heart attack. where we both collapse our lungs
No matter what they do, I can't lose in front of you. we're almost through.

We used to say (we used to say)
We used to say (we used to say)

What happened to our voice
There's no place left for heroes
Oh god you're the only one who knows
The cycle starts to zero in
So take us to the place that we call home
Your heart protects this sequence
Where we speak with love again

And I know, hearts will meet and when they do, hearts will start to mend.
And I know, there's no innocence
I won't break
I want it all

We
It's up to me (it's up to me)

I'll wait here for you
To revive me and take me home
From this waiting room
Where I sing your name and carve "I love you"

What happened to our voice
There's no place left for heroes
Oh god you're the only one who knows
The cycle starts to zero in
So take us to the place that we call home
Your heart protects this sequence
Where we speak with love again

Live the days
Count the stars
Hold me when
Our bodies fall

I can feel it: stars and sunlight
Places I've called home
Take me back for one more sunrise
With faces that I've loved

Hold me when our bodies fall and know you're not a second chance
A second hand. counting down. one dance, let's mean it

What happened to our voice
There's no place left for heroes
Oh god you're the only one who knows
The cycle starts to zero in
So take us to the place we call home
Your heart protects this sequence
Where we speak with love again

I'll wait here for you
To revive me and take me home
From this waiting room
Where I sing your name and carve "I love you"
