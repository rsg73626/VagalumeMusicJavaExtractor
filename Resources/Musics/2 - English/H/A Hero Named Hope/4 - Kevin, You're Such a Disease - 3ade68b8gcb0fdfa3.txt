KEVIN, YOU'RE SUCH A DISEASE

You never thought it'd come to this
Your life's only purpose
Bleeding lips and tying wrists of everyone you've loved.

I never said this would be fair
But now you see the nightmare keeps us lonely
It takes me slowly

So take these stars into your arms
I won't forget I promised that I would not let you fall
So take these stars into your arms
I won't forget I promised that I would not let you fall

I've loved so much I've smashed myself to pieces
I'm sorry, Darling. You knew this was business
I've took our photographs and notes
I've tore them all to pieces. You know I mean this. I mean this

If I had one chance, one dance, one breath I'd take
That day away

So take these stars into your arms
I won't forget I promised that I would not let you fall
So take these stars into your arms
I won't forget I promised that I would not let you fall

You are the shake in our voices (our voices)
You are the shake, the shake
Our voices
You are the shake in our voices (our voices)
You are the shake, the shake

I'm reaching out I almost have it

You are the shake in my voice
Because it feels so good to call your name
In winds that talk to me
Because it feels so good to call your name
That I can't stay

So take these stars into your arms
I won't forget I promised that I would not let you fall
So take these stars into your arms
I won't forget I promised that I would not let you fall

Remember when we'd count the stars?
And you'd pretend that they were ours
I will not let you fall
