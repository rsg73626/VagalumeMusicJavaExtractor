CLOSE TO CLOSURE

It would take every breathe
Every Breathe,Every breathe that I have left
To tell you what is wrong with this picture
And how we stand when we're close
Now we're getting oh so close
To desperately needed closure

Way down, Face down, break down, break down

Take me back to when I loved. It sounds pathetic but its true
Your hands around my neck, behind my back.
I swear I'm coming home
I thought you knew I swore you knew
I swear I'm coming home

No matter where we go
We'll quicken our pace and change the way we move
Cross the lines, close your eyes. A different nightmare every time
Saving lives with goodbyes
No matter where we are
It will always be a better place than where we were before

Now I rest and heal from this
And taking with me happiness
To a place that you have never been
Where I'm alive and breathing fine
And the only thing left of you
Is this distant memory

Way down, Face down, break down, break down

Take me back to when I loved. It sounds pathetic but its true
Your hands around my neck, behind my back.
I swear I'm coming home
I thought you knew I swore you knew
I swear I'm coming home

No matter where we go
We'll quicken our pace and change the way we move
Cross the lines, close your eyes. A different nightmare every time
Saving lives with goodbyes
No matter where we are
It will always be a better place than where we were before

And I love you so much, so much that I black out
Let's talk about your life without, before we cut each other down
Breathe deeply and start again

No matter where we go
We'll quicken our pace and change the way we move

No matter where we go
We'll quicken our pace and change the way we move
Cross the lines, close your eyes. A different nightmare every time
Saving lives with goodbyes
No matter where we are
It will always be a better place than where we were before

And I love you so much, so much that I black out
Breathe deeply and start again
