WHITE LIES

Sometimes it seems like I can't get away, from these people and their lies. Its like their too fucking afraid, to honestly live their lives. Shit-talking to the left 
Shit-talking to the right 
Do-Si-Do now, grab your partner and pick a fight. Punkers and their fashion, husbands and their wives, I'm surrounded by fucking, White Lies. You gotta admit it to yourself, and live it in your life. Honesty and kindness is worth the fucking strife. Dead bare branches blacking out the light, its a suffocating forest, of your verbal blight. Try to get out, it'll tear at your flesh, rip at your face. Talk your way out, but you'll never leave without disgrace. 
How many friends have you earned, with a backstabbing embrace? 
How much respect have you gained, while trying to save face? 
How much love, have you felt from fucking lying? 
None From Me
