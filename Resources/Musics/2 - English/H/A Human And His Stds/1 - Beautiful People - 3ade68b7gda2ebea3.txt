BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

There once was a bumper sticker that read : Practice Random Kindness and Senseless Acts Of Beauty. It moved me more than all the bumper stickers saying 2000 Vote Bush and Cheney. It meant 10 times more than the stickers that read Kepp Honking, I'm Reloading. And I hope the people who posted it practice what its saying, because its by truth and kindness my life is worth living. 

And the most beautiful people I have met, were also the kindest 
And the most beautiful people I have met, were treated the worst 
And the most beautiful people I have met, always leave my life 

But you can't expect to keep them forever, cuz they'll leave you sooner or later. Everyone does, in the end. But you can be one forever, for someone else, by loving each and everyone around. People, tree, dog, and cat, brown yellow, red white and black. Because its by truth and kindness my life is worth living. 

And the most beautiful people I have met, will live forever 
And the most beautiful people I have met, make more of a difference 
Than regular people, like me
