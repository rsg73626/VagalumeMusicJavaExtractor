POUR ME

I wanna rock and roll, all night your Dad says, while your mother looks through Cosmo Magazine. 
Your sneaking out, afraid of getting reamed, meeting with some friends to cruz the party scene. 
Your a little buzzed now whining and drunk, your life is hell and your parents are geeks 

Oh Pour me, Pour me another drink 

But you know what, no matter how much ya' fucked up you still got a place to sleep. 
And no matter how quiet you are when you leave they know. 
And when your at home puking your guts out, while their screaming, you know what their thinking? 
I wish I was you. 
And when your passed out with puke all over your sheets. 
Your Dad is at the bar stirring his ice and thinking, Man my sons girlfriend is hot, I wish I was his age, when did I grow up and whys my life so fucked up? 

Oh Pour me, Pour me another drink 

The truth about parents, boys and girls, is that their more messed up than we are. 
And what really sets 'em over the edge is their high school reunion. 
And you know what, someday, were gonna be just like 'em. 

Oh Pour me, Pour me another drink..
