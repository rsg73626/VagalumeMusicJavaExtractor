TEARDROPS IN BLOOD

Well...weve all grown older and none the wiser, and weve had our fair share of Budweiser, but its the memories that hold me together, when times were simple...the times that I remember... 

The times camping at the Santa Maria riverbed 
The comic shop that bought my Spawn when I was homeless 
For North China, for having the best chinese food ever 
For the punk rock sweaters that have outgrown us 
For the Orcutt pigs that beat up Jamie 
For Dog Park where I bring Pontius ( How could I have forgot) 

Heres to the times! 
Heres to the good time that we have had! 
Heres to the times that we wish we had! 
Heres to the times that we'll never have! 
Heres to the times! 

Like when Steve Corbet put us in the newspaper 
For the drunken brawls and keg stands 
For the garages where my bands have played in 
For the women that brought us from children to men 
For the people we care about 
I give you what I have now, I give you what I had then.... 

TearDrops in Blood! 
Heres to the good times that we have had! 
Heres to the times that we wish we had! 
Heres to the times that we'll never have! 
TearDrops in Blood 
TearDrops in Blood 
TearDrops in Blood
