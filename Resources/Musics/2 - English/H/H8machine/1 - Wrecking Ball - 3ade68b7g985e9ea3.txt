WRECKING BALL

Just like a wrecking ball, we're smashing through.
You can try and stand against, but your life is doomed.
See the pain and anguish unleashed at least,
Feel the pain and hatred as you hear me laugh.

I't like a nightmare what can you do,
Twist and turn in fear but it's come true.
Try and run away and cower down in fear,
But as you coming back around I'll be standing here.

Wrecking, destroy all of your enemies
Fight back, hit back, hit back takeout another victim.
Break down, the walls of opposition.
Break them-ALL.

The best things come to those who hate,
For an angry skinhead who just can't wait,
Yeah, throught my eyes everyone is a victim
They're feeling only pain form my fist as it hits 'em.

Built to last and heard as steel, 
Your crippled in pain paralyzed with fear,
You rolled the dice and got the loosing hand
The gambles up now your gonna pay like a man.

Tow the line and your gonna get beat,
No room for error no room for the weatk.
You ran your mouth just a little too much
And now your lying on the ground and you look like a punk.

Just like a wrecking ball we've smashed on through
We're leaving broken bodies when we're finally through
If you wanna step up and try to out our way,
They'll be picking you up and carrying you away
