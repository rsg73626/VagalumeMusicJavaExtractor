COMPLAINT

Why are you telling me to forget
I have no thought of doing so
Did you meet that person, by any chance
Did that person order you to just forget
Will you listen to my complaint
Every story of living, after I lost her
Not even missing a single day
I barely stand without alcohol
How can you say such a thing as to forget you
Find it for me, that person, please
For me who can't live nor die
That person's good-for-nothing life is earnest
Please bring her to me before it's too late
Don't curse at me, saying I"m a fool
And don't worry, asking why I"m like this
If you loved that person
Falling asleep in his embrace
You would not comfort me to forget
Find it for me, that person, please
For me who can't live nor die
That person's good-for-nothing life is earnest
Please bring her to me before it's too late
I can do it, I'll always wait for you
Until my whole body slowly hardens
Love so many times, separate so many times
I won't hate you even if you say you'll come back
Come back, to my side, please
Without you, every day is difficult
My spilled tears, when they cling to your feet, please
Your step quickens to where I am
Come
