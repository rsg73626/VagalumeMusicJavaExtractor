NIGHTMARE

When I open my eyes, everything is just as it was
Oh I dont know
In my dreams, you still suffocate me by my side
You are strangling my neck, I can't move my body

But I keep thinking that I forget you from my memory
I was so confident about this, but it was wrong oh~no~

Please stop now, everythings over
How much do I have to hurt more to end this?
Dont ever come back to me in my dreams
Because I have a hard time even thinking of you in my memories
