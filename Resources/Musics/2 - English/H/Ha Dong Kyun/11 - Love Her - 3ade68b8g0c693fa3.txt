LOVE HER

Will you wait a moment
I'll come get you right now
Why do you only keep crying
Tell me, tell me, where are you

Did the person you love leave you and go
I'll take you home
Let's go, let's go, because the wind is cold
What's so great about the person who makes you cry

You don't know, you're the only one who doesn't know
My heart that loves you
I couldn't be there first, because my steps were slow
The painful love of having my seat taken

Your smiling form
Is prettier than anyone else
Does that person even know
Really really know this, does he still make you cry

I don't know your name,
But I'm making this one request

Love her, love her
The girl that I love
The girl you have instead of me
Don't ever think you will treat her roughtly

Love her, the girl who doesn't know my heart
Because the one she loves is you
Love her more than I do
Don't ever make her cry again
