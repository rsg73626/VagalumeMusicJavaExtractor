I'LL GET READY

I will be waiting for you
I'll wait for you like this
So when we accidently meet, you won't be disappointed
So there will no other person better than me

Girl, I still want to live so that you can come back to me
Oh, Cant I see you in my arms under the morning sun?

I will be waiting for you
I'll wait for you like this
So when we accidently meet, you won't be disappointed
So there will no other person better than me

I was really bad.  I left you alone in lonliness and I always thought of myself
I will erase all my foolish past moments and I'll be born again

I wanna tell you my love
How I love you so..
Forgive me for realizing this now,
I wont hurt you ever again, I'll make you happy so it wont be hard for you

I know anything I say is useless
But I will always stay here, hoping you will come back

I will be waiting for you
I'll wait for you like this
So when we accidently meet, you won't be disappointed
So there will no other person better than me

I will make you happy
