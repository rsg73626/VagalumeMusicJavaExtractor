JUST LIKE HOW IT WAS

Waking up alone in the morning and a longer afternoon is just like how I was
A night I can’t sleep and the sun rising again at dusk is all just like how it was
Day by day with each day just being okay
The easiest job in this world, to wait for you
Like the ground cracking and a sign dropping my tears are just like how I was
Reminiscing by myself and putting down my feelings is just like how I was
Day by day with each day just being okay
The easiest job in this world, to wait for you

The words I couldn’t say, “I love you”
The words I’ll say when I see you, “I love you”
I love you, I love you, I will always be just like how I am
Day by day with each day just being okay
The easiest job in this world, to wait for you
Even though my love really leaves
I’m just like how I was, just like how I was
