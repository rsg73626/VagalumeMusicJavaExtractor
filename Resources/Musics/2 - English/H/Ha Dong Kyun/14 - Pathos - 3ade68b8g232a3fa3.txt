PATHOS

How can I live after forgetting you
How can I erase you
My one heart only loves you and only remembers you
My two eyes remember seeing you
My hand that let you go wants you
I cannot live if I have to forget the one that fills my whole heart

<GanJooJoong>

Has all the period of time you loved me come to an end
Has the time come for me to take you out of my heart and leave
I’ll fix all the bad habits that you don’t like about me if you tell me
I’ll treat your words I hear like my own life

How can I live after forgetting you
How can I erase you
My one heart only loves you and only remembers you
My two eyes remember seeing you
My hand that let you go wants you
I cannot live if I have to forget the one that fills my whole heart

If only for one moment of one day you would be beside me
I’ll pretend I don’t see that you love someone else

How can I live after forgetting you
How can I erase you
My one heart only loves you and only remembers you
My two eyes remember seeing you
My hand that let you go wants you
I cannot live if I have to forget the one that fills my whole heart

I bury my tears in the place where you set your feet
Will we meet again if I just follow the path that you walked

How can I live after forgetting you
How can I erase you
Asking to break up and telling me to be well are words I can’t believe yet
My two eyes remember seeing you
And my hands that felt you tries to grab hold of you
I cannot live after forgetting the one who left me alone
