HOLY IS THE LORD

Here I am after all
I bow my knee forever
To You I'll give my song
Mountains bow down, oceans roar
My heart is falling love
Rejoices in You alone

Even in the darkest night
I'll rest in You
Just in Your arms I found true peace
Awake my heart to see
The greatness of Your love
Glorious one

I will dwell in Your house forever
Seeking You as the angels sing
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord Almighty

Hear my voice when I call to You Lord
Turn your face to me
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord Almighty

Here I am after all
I bow my knee forever
To You I'll give my song
Mountains bow down, oceans roar
My heart is falling love
Rejoices in You alone

Even in the darkest night
I'll rest in You
Just in Your arms I found true peace
Awake my heart to see
The greatness of Your love
Glorious one

I will dwell in Your house forever
Seeking You as the angels sing
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord Almighty

Hear my voice when I call to You Lord
Turn your face to me
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord Almighty

In the storm, all night long
I will not be moved
'Cause You're my rock, my stronghold
You're my strenght and shield

In the storm, all night long
I will not be moved
'Cause You're my rock, my stronghold
You're my strenght and shield

Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?

I will dwell in Your house forever
Seeking You as the angels sing
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord Almighty

Hear my voice when I call to You Lord
Turn your face to me
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord Almighty

Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
