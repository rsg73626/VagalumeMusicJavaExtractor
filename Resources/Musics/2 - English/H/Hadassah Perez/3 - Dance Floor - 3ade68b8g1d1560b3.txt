DANCE FLOOR

When Your presence
Is surrounding me
I can feel your heart beat
And I now that I'm free

There's nothing to be afraid of
And nothing can separate me from what
You have given me

It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus

Snow that You are near
Underneath You are here
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus

You're holy spirit
And You gentleness
I can feel Your embrace
Wanna see you face to face

There's nothing to be afraid of
And nothing can separate me from what
You have given me

It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus

Snow that You are near
Underneath You are here
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus

On the dance floor
On the dance floor with you Jesus

It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor

It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus

Snow that You are near
Underneath You are here
It's it's all about
You and me on the dance floor Jesus
