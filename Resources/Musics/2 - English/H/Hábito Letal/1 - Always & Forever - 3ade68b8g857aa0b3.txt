ALWAYS & FOREVER

You say to me, you know I'am insane
You say, you will support me
You say, uncondittionaly
You say, you will always love me

Your always is just in the good times
Your forever, was just a lie
You forget it so fast and let me down
You just say its over in a bad time

All the time you are my force
But you, left me
But I have another forces
And this forces will never let me

Your always is just in the good times
Your forever, was just a lie
You forget it so fast and let me down
You just say its over in a bad time
