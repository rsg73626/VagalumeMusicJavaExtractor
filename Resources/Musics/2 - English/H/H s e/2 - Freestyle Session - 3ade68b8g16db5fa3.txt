FREESTYLE SESSION

[loud speaker]
Will you please take your seats
And clear the isle

Mic check...

[Redd]
I be doing things on my own, and ain't no need for a mentor
Girls wanna see me front and center, diamonds gleam when I enter
Hit the spot and them boys looking, that boys is so lovely
And that boy be popping champagne, that boy be sipping on bubbly
Running thangs, ain't no every day I'm on my campaign
Some boys be sipping cristal, moet pop serving champagne
Sip a fo' guzzler, straight up cause I got your muzzle
People too hard to figure out, so shit call me a puzzler
Freestyling nigga, boy I be showing charisma
Yeah I be shooting for Georgia Tech, like my name was Eddie Elisma
Doing this thing these boys can't mess with me, these boys can't test me
What's left to see, is that boy R-E double D
I'm a star sipping bar in the car, sitting sideways on the highway
Two hundred the fly way, what that boy say
That boy's out of control, that boy balling, that boy top drop low crawling
That boy's nineteen, that boy's not stalling
That boy mash for his green, that boy stacking cash for his dream
That boy last to get the green, that boy too fast on the scene
That boy be moving, that boy in the groove, that boy gon bust a move
That boy gon get the girls man, he gon make em all soothe
In a bubble bath in the jacuzzi, might pull a yellow bone floozie
That boy don't understand, cause that shit really don't amuse me
I'ma grab the microphone till the mic is gone, I can hit the spot
Like it or not I'm a big shot, fuck it drop

[AP]
I be at the stud' in the cool, with the draw walking in the nude
Telling her that I can come through, and I can get her into a interlude
At the same time I can have the tool, that's the microphone the utensil
While I come through the Southside, everybody say man that boy's instrumental
Better yet he's a republican or a democrat, everytime he look at
Talking bout man what he have to have, a motherfucking Cadillac
On fo's, and I'm still swanging to the elbows and they sticking out
What you talking bout, what about them boys on Rap-A-Lot
Love to talk about the hoes that I fuck, and I smash and I pass
At the same time everytime I receive, they be saying he's tip-toeing fast
Like a motherfucking ninja, or I mean the karate kid
At the same time I can drop the top, and I can go on and drop the lid
I mean I can let it fall, always come through and we still can ball
At the same time I gotta write my name on the wall, cause I gotta get a plack
I'm a mack in a Lac ready to attack, I duck on Shaq
Might as well make this boy put his granny, have a cardiac arrest
Using finesse I pop up in the STS, or a Benz
Me and my friends rolling on 20's, I mean three's
At the same time we some G's, sipping on Hi-C
Tropicana, here's the key to the banana, what about the scandalous
And Fraiser that he say, that he made the people
Cause they be talking bout what we doing, and how we be screwing
I'ma pass the mic to Flip, so he can get to doing what he doing
Grab the mic and be screwing

Man hold up...

[Lil' Flip]
Put the mic up, I'ma let y'all know I'm the Freestyle King
Got more ice than Dairy Queen, I pull up very clean on the scene
In a brand new machine, it might be a Jag
I wear my pants with a sag, had a BMX with mask
I never brag I never boast, I might eat on roast
And people say when we got a white cup in my hand, we might toast
I got Hump I got Redd to the side, we'll chunk it up
Uh ain't no drank in the cup, cause I done already drunk it up
I'm leaning I mean like a tower, got mo' drank than Doogie Hawser
Stay in Cloverland, I might pull up in the Prowler I'ma call
Get a room for a hour and take a shower, hit the West down to press

Cause these boys can't flow, these boys be saying I'ma come down
