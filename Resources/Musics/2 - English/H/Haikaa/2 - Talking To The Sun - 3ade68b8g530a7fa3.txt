TALKING TO THE SUN

I, I just wanna see
I just wanna feel it
In a simple way

I just wanna live
Trying to remember
All the simple things

Simple things like this
When it´s sad I cry
When it´s not I laugh

I get a feeling that I may be
All alone in this
It will never be that way

Hey, can you hear me
Or am I talking to the sun?

Is is the light of the sun
And just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
And just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
And just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun

I wanna tell the truth
Want you to see through me
Al there is to know

My story unfolds
Pick it up and read it
It´s full of simple things

Simple things like this
If it´s mine, I´ll take it
If it´s not, I´ll leave

I get a feeling that I may be
All alone in this
It will never be that way

Hey, can you hear me
Or am I talking to the sun?

Is is the light of the sun
Or just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
Or just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
Or just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun

What would it be like
If Hi meant Hi and not Goodbye
How would it be
If every smile meant I like you
Wouldn´t it be so much better
Would´t it be so much better
Wouldn´t it be I said I know it would be
Easier

Hey, can you hear me
Or am I talking to the sun?

Is is the light of the sun
Or just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
Or just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
Or just my shade on the ground
It´s the light of the sun
