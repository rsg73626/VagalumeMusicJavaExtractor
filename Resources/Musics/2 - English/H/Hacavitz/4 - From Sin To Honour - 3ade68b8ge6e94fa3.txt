FROM SIN TO HONOUR

Iam the one
Who possess the strenght
I am the one
Who satiates the bloodthirst

Sdeady I am
Leaving this land of deny
this poisoned flesh
And create a river of blood

That leads to eternity
Bring me spirit to accept my path
Bring me strenght to meet the death

I am the one
Who travel to the gods
To the deepest I will fall
From sin to honour

I am redemption
Somber death cult
Returning life

I face my death
With no remorse
Seeking purification
I explode

Leaving in honour
Reaping the sin
I fulfill the will

Leaving in honour
Reaping the sin
I fulfill the will
Devoured by earth
Anoter journey awaits

Now the lord satisfied
Look at my land

Reap my existence
Sculpting my flesh to nothing
From the highest I'll fall
From sin to Honour

Reap my existence
Sculpting my flesh to nothing
From the highest I'll fall
From sin to Honour

I am the one
Who possess the strenght
I am the one
Who satiates the bloodthirst
I am the one
Who travel to the gods
From sin to Honour

Now the lord Satisfied
Look at my land
