SUMMONING SELF-DESTRUCTION

Night
So unknown
Night
So untold

For once and beyond
I pray for the moons to come
And those woho had shone
So dark in mist of the night

Feeble punzing expulsion
Of this dead essece so unpure
For nebulous disasters
In this medium body I expose

For ages I had never Know
In its within that I rest
For endless humiliation
Of my body, mind and soul

I shall become
Night so unknown
Night so untold
Before light
Dark we summon

Bliss of the night
And dawn of opacity
Nebulous smoke of the dead
White and pale's the moon

Give me voice
No will to exist
Transform my sight and vision
And twist everlast this life

Mist so unpure
We breathe for the night
Despair and somber ecstasy
Hecaterma untold
