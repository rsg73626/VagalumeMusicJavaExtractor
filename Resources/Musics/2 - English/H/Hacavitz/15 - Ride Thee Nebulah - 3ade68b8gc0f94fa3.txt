RIDE THEE NEBULAH

Mist of the night
Fornever to breathe into dark
Solate to this
Immence valour within the dead

Setting the lunar dawn
Acrimonic desecrate beneath

Daze into this clowdy path
That no start to mortals had know

Darkness ride
Into nebular ash

Smoke of despair
Teaches left and right

Anxiety fed into panic
Freezes this will to live

Reaching without moving
This nebular trance of the dead

Inside light
That burns and draws illusion

Lie to the eyes of the world
Mocking and hiding the light
To this fools

No soul and no voice
Loss to this path and honor to the void
Those who swallow truth
And vision of ages of times never known

Pasion to death
And to walk this clowdy dark
ride thee nebulah
Immence clowdy scalb

Mist of the night
Fornever to breathe into dark
Solate to this
Immence valour within the dead
