LIGHTING BOLTS OV DEAD

Lighting forces ov the dead
Destroys immensely with wrath

Mercyless onslaught so dead
Fierce shadows ov nothing
Crest the fate ov reality
Perdition ov the cosmos
Pagan unholyness descends
In fury bestowed so bold
DESTROY, ERASE, EXTINCT

Proud these lands
Those witnessing thee ominous
Pounds into malign
Burning bolts ov disease

Born to death
Rapacious dread ov the night
Lighting forces ov the dead
Lighting bolts ov dead

Force ov the rabid
And venom to the weak
Necrotic assault spoils
Breeding disease within torment

Thundering hammer ov pestilence
Feasting forever the weak

The dawn ov the light
Comes faster than the dead
Doom to mankind
Lighting bolts ov the dead

Born to death
Rapacious dread ov the night
Force ov the rabid
And venom to the weak

Mercyless onslaught so dead
Fierce shadows ov nothing

Lighting forces ov the dead
Lighting bolts ov dead
