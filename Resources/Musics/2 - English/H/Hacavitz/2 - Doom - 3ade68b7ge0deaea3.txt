DOOM

This is the time where the buildings will fall
Where empires rise and kingdoms will crawl
And nobody knows what will happen to you
And do they care just what you do?

...It's like a fall...
...And then you'll crawl...
...Oh how they call...

You'll pay the price for your only crime
Your blackened soul is bled out on the line

You know know it's lost with the coming of time
And all the nations stepped over the line
The kings live fast and have all to lose
Burning with fear as they walk towards the noose

...and then you'll crawl...
...and they all fall...
...and lost it all...

...and lost it all...

This was the scene of your only crime
You're soul is lost and dead on the line
And nobody's here because nobody cares
You fought the war but nobody else dared

...doomed...
