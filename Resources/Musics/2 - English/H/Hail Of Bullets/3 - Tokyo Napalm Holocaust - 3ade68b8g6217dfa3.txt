TOKYO NAPALM HOLOCAUST

Distant shadows
Altitude low
Sirens warning
For the blow

Formations of superfortresses
Incoming B-29s
Hunters guiding
Silver silhouettes
B-San droning through the night
Delivering obliteration
The end of the empire is nigh
Determined to bring the apocalypse
Unleashing it from darkened skies

Napthenic palmatic acids
Mixed with jellied gasoline
The phenomenon of the firestorm
Exploding incendiaries
Most destructive of all weapons
Vile product of chemistry
Annihilation from the heavens
Damnation falls on the city

Napalm cylinders
Burst into fires
Collapsing buildings
Overcrowded hives
Asphyxiating
Roasted alive

Immense incandescent vortices
Inferno's ultimate stage
Walls of screaming humanity
Consumed by the whirling rage
Desperate mother's suffocating
Their babies fried on their back
Smouldering rest of existence
Civilians carbonized and black

Two hundred thousand
Burned, charred, and boiled
Deformed carcasses
Twisted and coiled
Disintegrated
Into hot soil

Gigantic pyre
Of melted flesh
Holocausted
Reduced to ash
