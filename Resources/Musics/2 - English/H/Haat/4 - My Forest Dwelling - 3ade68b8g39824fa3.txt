MY FOREST DWELLING

Inside my forest dwelling
No light can enter
No life distracts me
Of my eternal slumber
In solitary confinement
Shrouded in mist and darkness
One with the Essence
Of Nature and its majestic
Silence and Peace

Life won't endure this
Everlasting damp and obscure place
Except for me- For I am (the) One!

All hope is lost for
Progress and expansion
Here in this desolate space
At night the wolves howl
At daytime the woods speak
Of the tales brought by the wind
There's no place here
For lesser beings
Only true released spirits
Can find rest here
In my forest dwelling
