HATRED IS IMMORTAL

Buried under black soil
Rotting and rusting away
But never forgotten until this day

Twisting and turning
To be freed from this capture
Ready again to awake in Rapture!

Hatred is Immortal!
It will never fade away
Through a longforgotten portal
It's back again today

The downwards spiral of decay
Has actually made it stronger
All rusted and rotten Warmonger!

Now marching through your minds
Again in dismal glory it speaks:
"Hatred is back for the Heart that bleeds!"
