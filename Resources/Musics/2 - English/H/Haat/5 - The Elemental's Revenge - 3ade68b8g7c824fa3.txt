THE ELEMENTAL'S REVENGE

Roaring thunder
Lightnings scorched the Earth
A flood is rising
Fire and water consuming life
Mayhem from the skies!
The final ordeal for mankind

The elemental's revenge
Now the price will be paid
For ages of ignorance and greed
Cheap human lives can't really repay
But form a decent alternative
For quenching wrathful hatred

Fleas and rats deliver
An all-consuming plague
Festering across nations
Consuming human spirits
That's what they get back
For lust and greed!
