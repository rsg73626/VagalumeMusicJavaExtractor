THE NORTHWINDS BLOW

My love is gone across the ocean
Sailed away across the sea
We made a vow said we'll make it somehow
I guess it wasn't meant to be 

The northwinds blow time passes by so slow
And in my weary heart it's autumn forever more 

My love is gone beyond the mountains
She's locked the door to my heart
And thrown away the key
You know we made a vow said we'll make it somehow
I guess her promise wasn't made for me 

The northwinds blow time passes by so slow
And in my weary heart it's autumn forever more
The northwinds blow time passes by so slow
And in my weary heart it's autumn forever more 

My love is gone across the ocean
Sailed away across the sea
We made a vow said we'll make it somehow
I guess it wasn't meant to be 

The northwinds blow time passes by so slow
And in my weary heart it's autumn forever more
The northwinds blow time passes by so slow
