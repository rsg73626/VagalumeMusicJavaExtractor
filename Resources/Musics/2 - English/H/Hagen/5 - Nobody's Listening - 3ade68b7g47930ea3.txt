NOBODY'S LISTENING

Walking through silent corridors of time while the sun is going down
Echoes of the blind mans rage steals away the light
And a wild dog cries in the dead of night 

Walking through silent corridors of time while the sun is going down
Echoes of forgotten songs steals the silence away
And the musical box begins to play 

Walking through silent corridors of time while the sun is going down
Echoes of the blind mans rage steals away the light
And the future dies in the dead of night 

You are the blind man rage is flowing in your blood
The good things in life you cannot see you're waiting for the flood
I am the forgotten song nobody can recall
Got harmony rhyme and reason but you're not listening at all
Oh no you're not listening 

You are the blind man rage is flowing in your blood
The good things in life you cannot see you're waiting for the flood
I am the forgotten song nobody can recall
I'm peaceful fair and decent but you're not listening at all
No, no nobody's listening
No you're not listening at all 

Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening at all 

Nobody's listening
Nobody's listening
