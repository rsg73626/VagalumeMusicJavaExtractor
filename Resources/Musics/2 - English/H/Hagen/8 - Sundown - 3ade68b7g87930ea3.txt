SUNDOWN

Sundown hurry on my way
Sundown please come back and stay
Sundown satisfy my need
Sundown set me free 

Spare my weary eyes
From the blinding lights
Let the full moon rise
Bring on the night 

Sundown take away the pain
Sundown make me whole again
Sundown I move better in the dark
Sundown put out the spark 

Spare my weary eyes
From the blinding lights
Let the full moon rise
I am waiting
Waiting for the night
