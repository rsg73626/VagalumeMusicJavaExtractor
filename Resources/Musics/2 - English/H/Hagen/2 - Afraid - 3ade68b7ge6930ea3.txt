AFRAID

Kenny was afraid to die just like many a troubled kid
Kenny was afraid to die even more afraid to live
Kenny was afraid to cry so he stayed away from love
Kenny was afraid to fly he burned the feathers of the helpless dove 

One fatal night he felt a desire he could not resist
Kenny was afraid to die so he finally cut his wrists 

Jenny was afraid to ask so she never said a word
Jenny was afraid to ask 'cause the answer she'd get might hurt
Jenny was afraid to show what she really felt inside
Jenny didn't want them to know she was to be the reaper's bride 

One fatal night she felt a desire she could not resist
Jenny was afraid to die so she finally cut his wrists 

Kenny was afraid to die just like many a troubled kid
Kenny was afraid to die even more afraid to live
Kenny was afraid to cry so he stayed away from love
Kenny was afraid to fly he burned the feathers of the helpless dove 

One fatal night he felt a desire he could not resist
Kenny was afraid to die so he finally cut his wrists
