REMEMBER

Remember us when you hear this song in a hundred years or more
Just think of us as we think about you and you'll see that we're not gone 

Smile with us and we'll sing for you
The song will last and we will too
Smile with us and you'll see it's true
The song will last and we will too
Yes we will too 

Remember us when you hear this song remember us long gone
Just think about us and we'll think about you united in this song 

Love is what matters the power that gathers
