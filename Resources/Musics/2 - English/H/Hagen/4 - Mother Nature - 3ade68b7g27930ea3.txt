MOTHER NATURE

Mother nature can comfort and lead us
Can shelter and feed us
But she doesn't need us
Mother nature can cheat and mistreat us
Destroy and defeat us
'Cause she doesn't need us 

Mother nature can shelter and feed us
Or kill and defeat us
'Cause she doesn't need us
Mother nature doesn't need us
Mother nature doesn't heed us 

Up and down and round and round we spin
Like dust in the wind
Up and down and round and round we spin
