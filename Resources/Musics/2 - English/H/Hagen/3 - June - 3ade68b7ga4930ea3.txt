JUNE

The sun shines on my pillow as the dawn is breaking through
The birds are singing merrily but I'm forever blue
Blue for you 

It's June outside my window November in my heart
If only we could try again and make a brand new start
'Cause I'm tired of feeling lonely so tired of feeling blue
Can't face another morning just can't go on without you 

I've told you that I'm sorry
I've tried to understand
For your love I'd do everything
Your wish is my command
I've told you I will follow
Anytime and anywhere
I'll beg and steal and borrow
Just to show how much I care
I've told you that I love you
And my love goes on and on
I will love you true forever
'Til the day of Kingdome come
But oh why did you go
Leaving me sore wondering
Oh why did you go
