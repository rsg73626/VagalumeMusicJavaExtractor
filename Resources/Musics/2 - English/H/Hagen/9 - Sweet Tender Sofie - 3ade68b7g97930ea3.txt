SWEET TENDER SOFIE

Sweet tender Sofie
Tell me what you're doing to me
I hear your voice clear and loud
I see your face in every cloud 

Is there anything I can do to get through to you
Is there anything I can say anyway
Oh girl I think you know that I love you so
Oh girl I think you know that I love you so 

Sweet tender Sofie
I'm a fool for your loving can't you see
You break my heart but I kind of enjoy the pain
Oh pretty baby you're driving me insane 

Is there anything I can do to get through to you
Is there anything I can say anyway
Is there anything I can do to get through to you
Is there anything I can say anyway
Oh girl I think you know that I love you so
