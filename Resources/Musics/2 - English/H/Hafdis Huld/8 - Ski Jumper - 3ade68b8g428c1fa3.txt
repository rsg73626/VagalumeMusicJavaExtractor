SKI JUMPER

He told her he would give everything
If she just could bring him
A ski jumper

And after the next few weeks
He likes the jumper heaps
And he wants to be
A ski jumper

He's standing there tall
Wearing his jumper and all
When his heart gets small

Down down don't wanna go down
Don't you push me down
I wanna hang around a little longer

His feet are cold
He says they should have told him
What it's like for
A ski jumper

He's starting to slide
And there's nowhere to hide
When you're
A ski jumper

He's standing there tall
Wearing his jumper and all
When his heart gets small

Down down don't wanna go down
Don't you push me down
I wanna hang around a little longer

Down down don't wanna go down
Don't you push me down
I wanna hang around a little longer

He's in the air so there's not much to do
But enjoy the view for
The Ski Jumper

He's standing there tall
Wearing his jumper and all
When his heart gets small

Down down don't wanna go down
Don't you push me down
I wanna hang around a little longer

Down down don't wanna go down
Don't you push me down
I wanna hang around a little longer

A little longer
