YOUNGER LONGER

You're the star of my dreams
My personal sunbeam
My heart is your home
I'm never alone

Sometimes I'm in the dream too
Just looking at you
We shout and we play
We're finding our way

We're not in a hurry
Let's take a little time
We'll just stay younger
A little longer

How amazing I feel
Can you be for real
I'm just smiling at you
You make it all new

We lie sight by sight
It just feels so true
To be here with you

We're not in a hurry
Let's take a little time
We'll just stay younger
A little longer

A collection of moment's
Going to extremes
I didn't know that sometimes living
Is better than the dream

We're not in a hurry
Let's take a little time
We'll just stay younger
A little longer...
