MY HEADS BEATS

How do I look
What do I do
Why does God make me
Run into you
Should I talk
Should I pout

My heart beats
Way too loud
And my heart beats
Way too loud

Try not to notice you look my way
All of my feelings are on display
Should I talk
Should I pout

My heart beats
Way too loud
And my heart beats
Way too loud

You're an ongoing challenge
In the story of me
Still don't know
How the ending should be

I wish that I knew now
What I knew then
Danced my way to trouble once again

My heart beats
Way too loud
And my heart beats
Way too loud

My heart beats
Way too loud
And my heart beats
Way too loud
