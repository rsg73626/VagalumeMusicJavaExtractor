DIAMONDS ON MY BELLY

A guy full of holes opens the door
Sees on my face I've never been before
Only noises no soothing sounds
Decorated people tell me
It looks great on you
It's just not my thing
The receptionist has a nipple ring
In this place I'm like a boring saint
Use all my strength
Not to faint again

A little later I'll let you see
Diamonds on my belly
Like the rapper girls on TV
Diamonds on my belly
A little later I'll let you see
Diamonds on my belly
The only thing between you and me
Diamonds on my belly
Diamonds on my belly

The scariest guy I've ever seen
Tries to smile but he still looks mean
Tell myself it just can't be him
When I look up he invites me in
Ask him to give me something sweet
He brings back more than I need
Then suddenly everything goes black
I wake up, see the glittery track

A little later I'll let you see
Diamonds on my belly
Like the rapper girls on TV
Diamonds on my belly
A little later I'll let you see
Diamonds on my belly
The only thing between you and me
Diamonds on my belly
Diamonds on my belly...
