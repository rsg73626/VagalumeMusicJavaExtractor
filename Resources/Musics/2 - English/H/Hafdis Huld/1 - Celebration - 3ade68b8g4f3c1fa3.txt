CELEBRATION

Someday I'll find myself
In a vacuum with you
And I'll unwind and stay behind your shoulder
And I'll unwind and stay behind your shoulder

Celebration, celebration
Celebration, celebration

My breath will warm you
I'll soothe you with my touch
And you shed a tear and I'll be near
To dry you

Celebration, celebration
Celebration, celebration

How easily we loose the others
Fade into our world
And manipulate and celebrate our world

Celebration, celebration
Celebration, celebration
