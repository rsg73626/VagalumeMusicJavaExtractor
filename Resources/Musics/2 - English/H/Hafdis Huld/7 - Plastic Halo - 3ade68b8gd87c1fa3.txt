PLASTIC HALO

My first time for years
With minimal makeup
Waiting to hear
It's the true you

You don't even smile
You never notice
When I do things for you
When I do things for you

I hope you choke
In your plastic halo
I hope you choke
In your plastic halo
'Cause now I know
It's the right way for you to go

Find parts of myself
That were not missing
Make up opinions as good as yours
The harder I try
The more you dislike me
I'll never be good enough
I'll never be good enough

I hope you choke
In your plastic halo
I hope you choke
In your plastic halo
'Cause now I know
It's the right way for you to go

You'll never fly
Like proper angels in the sky
But I'd love to see you try

It's always about
How you feel
Witch would be ok
If your feelings are real
If you listened to me
Perhaps you'd see
That we're better off without you
Were better off without you

I hope you choke
In your plastic halo
I hope you choke
In your plastic halo
'Cause now I know
It's the right way for you to go
Now I know
It's the right way for you to go
