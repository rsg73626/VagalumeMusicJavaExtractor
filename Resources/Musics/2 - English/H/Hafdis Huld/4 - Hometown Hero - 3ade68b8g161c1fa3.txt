HOMETOWN HERO

We stand in a pack staring
Like younger girls do
They all look apple cheeked
Iâ€™m sure I do too

It's way past midnight
Sweat makes hair stick
To the back of my neck
This excites me

He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero

I must be one of God's
Big time favourites
Must have done something right
To deserve all this

We've gone obsessive
And his second hand Honda
Is the centre of my world
I am envied by senior girls

He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero...

How good it feels to walk here
Holding hands
I'd like you even more
If you were in a band

He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero
He's my hometown hero...
