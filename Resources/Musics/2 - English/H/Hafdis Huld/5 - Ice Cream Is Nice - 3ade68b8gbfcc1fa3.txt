ICE CREAM IS NICE

He's a big blue monster
From a cartoon script
He could have guns
Shoot bang from the hop
His ammunition is not real
There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear

I've got it all figured out
Ice cream is nice
Monsters are not
Ice cream is nice
Monsters are not

Maybe the monster
Needs a green chickadee
I want him to want her
And stop wanting me
They could be lovers
And just let me be
Just let me be

'Cause I've got it all figured out
Ice cream is nice
Monsters are not
Ice cream is nice
Monsters are not

He won't go looking
He's keeping on scaring
They meet by a chance
The kind that is a setup
Find romance in a blue green getup

I've got it all figured out
Ice cream is nice
Monsters are not
Ice cream is nice
Monsters are not

Ice cream is nice
Ice cream is nice
Ice cream is nice
