BEYOND MY GRASP

I tried, with every shard of my being,
To extend my help, but for what

There is nothing i want more than to be able to have your hands press against my chest,
So that you could feel the absence of a beating heart.
One that with those same gentle hands, you, yourself tore out.

Straining to grasp a hold of the past,
My hand remains empty and alone,
I slowly become cold to the touch,
Just beyond my grasp it all fades away

My hand clenches itself into a fist,
Buried rage consumes,
Anger points itself at my hollow figure,
For letting you in to begin with,

I tried, and i cared, and i lost,
And you, what has become of you,
Maybe you suffered the worse of our two fates,
Amidst all of this you lost who you were,

Truth, such a simple word,
Ive become so disillusioned with its meaning,
I know its the one thing i have left in my heart,
And no matter what, ill cherish that,

(spoken word in middle)
From this day forth i will resign myself quietly to an empty and lonely existence,
Not allowing me once again to become so vulnerable,
By concealing my emotions and becoming one with the stone on which we walk upon,
I remove all chance of repeating the victimization of my innocent and calloused hope,
And subsequently i withdraw onto myself a lack of concern and care for all around me,
For i am lost and will continue to lose.

And i ask myself, time and time again,
Am i responsible for letting you slip away
There will always remain that one burning question,
But there is only so much one man can do.

Then i see you again,
With a smile on your face,
I bite my tongue and turn the other way,
What corpse carries a smile with it as its left for dead
