PSICHOLOGIC PRESSURE

Mind mine can’t decode
the rules of a game tracherous
when the eyes don’t see the light
of reality
you don’t feel, don’t understand
what’s happened around you?

Blood scatter in the news
I see distortion images of truth
Lies don’t leave me touch and feel
all the pain of real world!

(Chorus:)
Pressure in your mind
Oh, God! My eyes bleed through the TV
Pressure in your mind
(Eat fashion and drink talk show!)
Pressure in your mind
My soul is prisioner in a virtual web
Pressure in your mind
(I break your opinions and dictate
Your desires!)
