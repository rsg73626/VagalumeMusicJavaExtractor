FEELING MACHINE

Cry! Confusion, fear and pain
Blind, we follow our destiny
Why the end is always the same?
We born and die living a life of lies

Like a nightmare again and again
My conscience condemn my desires
Tears are the fuel, the machine is my brain
Becoming feelings in despise

(Chorus:)
Conscience: "What do you see when you close your eyes?"
Me: Inside of me the feelings die, suicide?
Conscience: "What do you see when you close your eyes?"
Without hope living day by day and there's no turning back"

Lost between love and hate
(lost between love and hate I runaway from my self)
Running away from myself
(running away, lying, hiding all feelings in my cold heart)

Why can't we cry when tears drown our eyes?
I am so weak, why hide me in my own lies?
Answer me, why?

(Chorus)
Conscience: "Don't believe in your desires"
Me: Inside of me the feelings die, in my mind!
Conscience: "Don't believe in your desires"
Without hope dying day by day and there's no turning back!
