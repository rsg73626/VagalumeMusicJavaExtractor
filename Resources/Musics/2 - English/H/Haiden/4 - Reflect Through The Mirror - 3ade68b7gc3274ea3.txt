REFLECT THROUGH THE MIRROR

Why? forever insane in a world of desilusions, cruel and so real…
Shadows in my room suffocate my thoughts, the mirror in the wall reflect one body sick and frail
while my mind maddens!

Searching for answers but running away from truth
The window is the frame and the picture is deep blue
Falling into madness, beyond reality
And now this deep blue become darkness upon me
…

When I felt was out of control
I saw that was unreal!
My world fell down and all my life too
Now the mirror show doom

The mirror reflects all truth without lies
Again it all again
The mirror reflects such smile and cry
The mirror reflects all truth without lies
Again it all again
Dividing my madness from my mind
The mirror reflects all truth without lies
Sentencing my fate and showing who I really am,
In here this room

Lie… I’m in this same room, I’m feeling the same pain,
The shadows says who I am
Memories of a life, places where I was, lies created by myself
The body on the bed is mine 
I can see Through the mirror
I’m in here again!
