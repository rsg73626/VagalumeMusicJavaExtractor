ANCIENT TIMES

The dawn of new millenium
Bring the wind an old song…
Memories of distant times
Keep the pain, slavery and lies

I see the fever in their eyes, they run as blind men
Seeking for light, enslave and kill like before
Their fears become desires!

All wisdom and progress of the science
Promises of chances and peace
But they don’t learn with fauts of the past,
A new time, new babylon

The valleys, hills and skies, no more the same
But an old song stay… ancient times

All greats empires, Glorious kingdoms and domains
(they) have one destiny, become wreck and dust
Now the words to be in vain, that song is listen to again
“So the prophecy will come, won’t remain stone by stone!”
