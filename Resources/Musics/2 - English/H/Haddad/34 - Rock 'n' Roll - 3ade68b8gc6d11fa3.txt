ROCK 'N' ROLL

ROCK'N ROLL
(Gustavo Haddad)



A famous newspaper said
that rock'n roll music is dead
Blues is buried
and maybe nobody cares

Old lover, come closer now
Crazy soldier, don't let it down

Rap-house is the sound
The Beatles keep out of time
Punks and freaks went to home
The new kids are alright

Old lover, come closer now
Crazy soldier, don't let it down

I feel like losing my swing
I have been out of control
My revolution was wrong
Their ideology is fine (seems fine...)

Old lover, come closer now
Crazy soldier, don't let it down...
