MANKIND

MANKIND
(Gustavo Haddad)


No, please don't keep working
Do it for yourself and go!
It's time to open your eyes

Don't!, please don't keep buying your laugh and your tears
Dear, it's time to open your heart
Free and easy

Don't!, please don't keep waiting
It doesn't show you the way
It's time to wake up (make up) your mind and see...

I don't trust in pretty lies anymore
How can I see the light if you close the doors?
We know the reason why
We're not satisfied at all...

Only a man can think and feel
To build a dream and make it real
I can't find emotions inside your I.B.M.
Fishes need wide ocean
As eagles need the sky
I'm looking for horizons to mankind...
