VICTIM OF LOVE

VICTIM OF LOVE
(Gustavo Haddad)


I'm a victim of her love
Every time I come to town
I'm a victim of her poison
It is in my vein and lets me high
When she shakes (ooh shake, honey)
I know it's good to be alive

I'm a slave of her beauty
Every night I knock at her door
When we're rockin' and rollin'
She picks me up and puts me down
When she thinks I had enough
I bite her body and ask for more

I'm a victim of her love
She's in my brain and spins me round
People say that I'm crazy
Say I'm a fool, but  I don't care
If someday this love kills me
I know that I'll be a grateful dead
