FAR FROM HOME

You were scared, you are frightened
Now we're all alone
I don't know what I'm doing here
So sorry, but I'm gone

Baby our faith was just ilusion
Everything we've said and done
We're apart, you know,
There's no way to get back home

I don't care if you hate me
If I'm right or wrong
I don't know why you're standing near
I'm sorry but I'm gone

Baby our world was just confusion
Everything we've said and done
We're apart, you know,
There's no way to get back home
