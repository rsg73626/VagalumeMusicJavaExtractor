REDDISH BONFIRE

Since her parent's death
You can find evy in the market place
Weeping and looking for nowhere
She puts a pin
In her long and reddish hair
With misfortune in her eyes

Eve...
I bless you when you're crying
I know you when you're kidding
And I can feel you're sorrow and pain

Eve... 
I love you when you're flying
I hate you when you're shouting
I can feel your sorrow and pain
