MADNESS

MADNESS
(Gustavo Haddad)


Hey mother freedom, what's the matter with you?
Do you remember my name?
Why are you always so cruel?
My boat is in flame down the river
My soul is still cold...
How do you feel when I'm singin' the blues?

I lie in the morning
The lies of today
Blinded by routine
My blues turns to grey

And I need some adventure
I'm in need of more fun
Feel all that magic inside
The old dream is gone
But I've got a new one
Lord, I found all my madness in time
Just in time

I pray every evening
And they say: "there's nothing to do"
Guided by fortune
My grey turns to blue...
