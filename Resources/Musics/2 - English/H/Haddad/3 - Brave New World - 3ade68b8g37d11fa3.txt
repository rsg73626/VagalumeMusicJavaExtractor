BRAVE NEW WORLD

THE BRAVE NEW WORLD
(Gustavo Haddad)

WELCOME TO THE BRAVE NEW WORLD, BROTHER
A PLACE WHERE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARES COME TRUE
ARE YOU FEELING LIKE A DEAD DUCK?
OH, BELIEVE ME: YOU'RE STILL ALIVE!

We've sold our minds and hearts for money
We broke the dream and it was funny
We lost our hands in a hole
If I'm wrong, let me know
We've said goodbye to peace and love
We found THE BRAVE NEW WORLD

We've sold our rights and lives for money
We broke the deal and it was funny
We hide our heads in the sand
and play the game the best we can
We've said goodbye to our old friends
We found the WONDERLAND

Round and round, in circles
The angry crowd, they all keep running
Million clowns in circus
Blind, deaf and dumb, they all keep burning

We brought the evil and moved the knife
We killed the moondogs into the night
Anyway the show must go on
It should be good, should be strong
We've said goodbye to old love songs
here in BRAVE NEW WORLD
