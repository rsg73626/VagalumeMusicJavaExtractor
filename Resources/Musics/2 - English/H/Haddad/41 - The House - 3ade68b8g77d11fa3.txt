THE HOUSE

THE HOUSE
(Gustavo Haddad)

A new moon is rising
Beyond the rainy clouds
Strange things happens
In this empty house

Old spirits talks to me
My eyes can clearly see them
I know I'm getting insane
After all these years...

The night is falling
The lights were out
The past is calling
I'm lonely now

My life is running fast
Music is playing  loud
I won't draw the lines
I did my best
