I'M LEAVING YOU

I'M LEAVING YOU
(Gustavo Haddad)


I'm leaving you
And you know it's true
I should be happy now
But I'm feeling  blue

It hurts me anyway
No matter what I say or do,
I keep believing

I'm down and out
But I'm not a fool
I've got a future now
Now I'm leaving you

It hurts me anyway
No matter where I'm going to,
I'll keep believing
No matter what I say or do
I keep believing
