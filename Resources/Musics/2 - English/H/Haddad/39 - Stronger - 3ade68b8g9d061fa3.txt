STRONGER

Walking on the wild side
Drowning in the rain
When it doesn't kill, 
it makes you STRONGER

Playing with a sharp knife
Learning with the pain
I hear the hazard calling for me
out there

There's a long way 'till tomorrow
It's a long way to be free
There's no reason for our sorrow
There's a chance for you and me

Forgetting suicidal plans
Growing up like Peter Pan...

Shining as a starlight
Living without friends
When it doesn't kill,
it makes you HARDER

Flying into the black night
Rolling like a train
I hear the danger calling for me
out there

There's a long way 'till tomorrow, etc.

Saving suicidal plans
Dreamin' like a rotten ham...
