HOME, SWEET HOME

HOME, SWEET HOME
(Gustavo Haddad)

I always heard my mom say:
"Someday I will disappear,
DROP OUT!
and find my freedom"

Echoes and lost sensations
Events that I never recall
Meantime...
The world is sleepin'

Home, home, home, home, home...
Another prison
Just one more dope
Steelin' my reason

Cold in the night
No tear roll down when I cry
The city lights
Shine through my window...
Is it in my mind?
Oh no...

Flashbacks of my shy childhood
That does mean nothing at all
But even now
I still remember

Love, love, love, love, love...
It's just a delirium
Burning my soul
Painting my feelings
