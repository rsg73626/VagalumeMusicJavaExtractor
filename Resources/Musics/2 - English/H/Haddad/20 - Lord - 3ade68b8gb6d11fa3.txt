LORD

LORD
(Gustavo Haddad)


Forgive me, Lord
For all my crimes and my sins
But can you give more?
Can you hear me?

Lord, would you bless me?
Could you help me live in peace,
could you set me free?

I'm a weak man, I'm a loser
I've been crawling in the darkness
I've been trying, but I can't go on...

What can I say?
How can I trust in you?
When I don't know if what I feel is true

Lord, would you save me?
Could you help me live in peace,
could you set me free?

I'm your toy, your fallen angel
I've crawling through the darkness
I've been trying, but I can't go on...
