TALK 3

When I was a small child the sky was so far away
But I wasn't scared 

Because I had a big dream that was filled in between the sky and my space.
When I became a tall middle school student the sky had drawn close to me
But I slowly started to become scared 

As much as I had grown my dream had also become smaller
When I became the JaeWon who sings, 

I was flying the sky before I realized it.
Now, I can touch the sky but I miss the land again. 

Because my love and dream is already there..
