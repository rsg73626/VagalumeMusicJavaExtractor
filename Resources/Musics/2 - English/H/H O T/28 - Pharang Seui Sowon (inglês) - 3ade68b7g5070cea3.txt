PHARANG SEUI SOWON (INGLÃŠS)

(*)we waited for today how hard was it i love you we'll always be together

We're very far away but i'm happy as i think of you
Our ways of speaking is different but i love you~ baby
Then on a winter's day we were not able to see each other again
Not because of our mistake but because of another reason~ baby
What you're doing right now how much i miss you
We both will not know it is only my wish like this

Repeat (*)

Rap))i love you i love you say i love you to the person next to you right now
When we had to part not because of our mistake but because of another reason
Even if we can not see each other again i think about your happy face when you heard the words i love you
You who were happy let's love each other freely i love you

You're close by, but i can not see you who i miss i probably can not hold you no~ baby
Someday there will be a day when we'll be together
When everything can be together we both want it i believe in becoming one
We always waited as much as the hard times i don't want to lose anymore

Rap))i'm happy really i'm so happy just a moment ago i told my mother, father and the one
I love that i loved them among them i said i love you to my father as i closed my eyes and thought about him
As i did that i had become a blue bird and was flying towards the north where my father was at

Children's chorus))filling my heart with love i will become a blue bird and fly to you~

We always waited as much as the hard times i don't want to lose anymore
