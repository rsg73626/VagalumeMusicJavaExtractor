TALK 6

There is a woman, 
who I love. 
My special woman, 
always fills the space next to my bed when I fall asleep 
and when an eye dazzling morning comes she wakes me up with a warm kiss. 
Next to me a pretty baby is sleeping while breathing out lightly 
and I am drinking the sweet morning coffee she makes me. 
To me she is the meaning of my existence and I am her sole fan. 
So I am happier than ever. 
And for reference, this baby is the dream I want to achieve 10 years later
