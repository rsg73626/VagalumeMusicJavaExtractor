DO OR DIE (INGLÃŠS)

Ah yea- yo yoyo~! 
Take me back uh 
no pain no gain


*Chorus*
Why is the sky crying 
Also my heart crying 
My longing I have for you 
I wanted to forget you
I will hate you 
Why they are taking you 
I don't know

The one wish that disappeared as everything passed by is like a faded memory oh 
As much as the time I was happy while I was by your side 
I was even more miserable I can't bear with it
I really hate watching the ordeals any longer 
Leave and meet isn't that kind of love luxury?
Inside the meaningless meetings that have become a habit, 
what can there be 
It is probably empty
You, 
who's heart was in pain, 
No I wish you didn't have that kind of regret 
Your love becomes deeper 
My heart that longs for you becomes more 


*Chorus 2*
You left me 
Far from me 
Hey! Baby! 
Bitch that's she gone me six feet under 
I'm bout to bring the thunder 
Forget it 
That kind of thing now 
Hey! Baby! 
Bitch that's she gone me sixfeet under 
I'm bout to bring the thunder break off! 

Inside the time that has stopped and can not go back 
It seems as if the thrill from back then has found it's way to me again 
Honestly I know that I was too reckless but you can not stay here

Tell me Why 
Why Do we live only to die 
Going through this game of life 
Not knowing how 
or we gotta stop trippin start grippin quit bull shittin 
whatcha gonna do who ya gonna be to be or not to be

*Chorus* (x2)
