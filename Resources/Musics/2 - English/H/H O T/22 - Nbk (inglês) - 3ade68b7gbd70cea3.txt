NBK (INGLÃŠS)

abhorrence, anger, pain, grief, regret, and betrayal all these words describe my feelings
for you and you know one day you'll pay your price too!
Right now I who can not do anything I can not see because tears block my view but can you
not understand my heart that wants to see you just once Even though I comforted myself like
crazy saying that I wouldn't look for you again The days that are aleady hard to erase conquered
inside time Nightmare like days It was my illusion thinking that the word love was
something that filled each others empty space defeating, colliding and holding each other so
we wouldn't get hurt in this difficult world but I realized it was something that filled each
others money, satisfied the desires everyday and if it got boring, we'd become the characters of
a sad movie and split, crying like that NBK You're a natural born killer Stab me Then you'll
be caught in the obvious trap The strings can't be seen, but you're already his puppet You'll
probably go around here and there on the stage Of course the main character is you It's so damn
freaking easy, you make my head f---ing easy, busy, I'm entangled in your play that can not be
understood Turn everything back!

I sacrifed my everything for you but ignoring me are you making me miserable Only late regret is
left in my collapsing heart Without a trace everything is disappearing

Now I won't stand behind you again I who was ripped apart from your trap At the end of this
world without you How can you do this to me What went wrong that you're making me experience
this unbearable pain Why me Why! What sin did I commit against you that you are making me break
weakly (Now) Making me bowdown on my knees Go so I can miserably sit down by myself Memories
recollections of when we laughed (hugged) and cried that were times merely meaningless to
you were times that were special to me while I loved you I am trying to go back to dirt now
Being poor the only thing I had was you Since my dream is spread under your feet easily step
upon it You who steps on my dream I pray for your misery If you are happy that will be unfair
As much as the abhorrence I feel right now as much as my pain,your life will also not be
beautiful

I sacrifed my everything for you but ignoring me are you making me miserable Only late regret is
left in my collapsing heart Without a trace everything is disappearing

Even the word good-bye will probably be useless to you but I don't think I can handle this kind
of pain I have to leave you How~

I sacrifed my everything for you but ignoring me are you making me miserable The only thing left
is my miserable image inside fear, regert, I was your slave which I didn't know of Inside the
unwise painful sorrow sweeping everything away like a hanful of dust I will erase you now
