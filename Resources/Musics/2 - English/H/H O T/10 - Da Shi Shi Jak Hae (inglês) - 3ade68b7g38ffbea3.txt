DA SHI SHI JAK HAE (INGLÃŠS)

Rap)
I turn around and look at my remaining path as I lost many things.
During those many times, I shed tears sometimes due to sadness or happiness, but I won't
give up, because I have a precious friend right in front of me that keeps my dream.
Whatever pain comes, I want to be truthful in front of you- I don't know how my mind
will be displayed, but do you know that I am speechlessly grateful to you?

In the heart of beginning again, heart that will never change, so the preserved innocence
wouldn't change, we meet again someday, I promise that we will be forever.

Song)
We begin everything again now.
Wipe away the tears that trail from your eyes.
Forget what happened yesterday and dream again. Begin again.
During the difficult day, when I want to give everything up,
Your love that comforted me stands me up
So I could at last find the big meaning of life again.

I lost a lot of things in no time and everything left my side,
But when I see you next to me smiling, I am happy.
I don't cry anymore, if you in my heart can be forever.

Rap)
The memories that are precious when I think about them,
The times I spent with you guys,
Deep within our hearts, our pain and sadness we feel together,
We overcome them together and pave through the harsh world,
We are just one of those many people,
One love that made us today,
You wouldn't know, your image is felt deep in our hearts.

Song)
We begin everything again now.
Wipe away the tears that trail from your eyes.
Forget what happened yesterday and dream again. Begin again.

Saying that just looking at us makes you happy.
You who observe us from a far place.
Your image that protected me, the warm love,
I want to return the times.
No matter how much loneliness comes, I won't show my weakness.
Hold my hand, you are no longer alone.
To be like this forever, like this,
So I can always smile at you.
