GOMAWU MIAHNHAE (INGLÃŠS)

When did you start waiting..
I am always sorry when I see you guys exhausted 
I can not say a word but will you remember just this 
The shy contents inside your pretty letters 
I, who was in pain, 
become happy 
In front of the tears that sometimes fill your eyes 
I couldn't do anything for you but 

*Chorus*
Inside our music, 
the endless song you sang out loud together was all for you guys 
More than the words I love you more than the words thank you 
I want to to say that we will be together forever 

We, who were hurt easily 
The days we spent as we comforted and protected each other 
Unable to say a word 
The reason we were able to hold our two fists tightly and say nothing like that would happen ever again 
(Is because there was the love of you guys) 
The reason we were able to bear with it as we sat up many nights crying is because we had the love of you guys 
It is something made by us not me (for a beautiful memory in the days ahead) 
I know your heart that tried to comfort my exhausted face that shook sometimes

*Chorus*

If someone said it was a star that couldn' t be approached 
I can't wipe off the tears flowing down from your eyes 
but I'll say it now from the closest place from you 
Your stories that say you went through all the hard times by seeing and listening to us 
and your letters that were more admirable than anything in the world, 
and small presents 
Your pretty eyes that lit and opened our hearts with a limpid light 
When I am exhausted and swaying it raised me up 
Do you know I am very thankful. 
Like the feeling of one 
As much as we worried about each other 
We will always think of you guys 
Always I did that 
We can not substitute for your feelings that head towards us but remember our honest hearts..
Nanana.--

More than the words I love you 
More than the words thank you 
I want to to say that we will be
together forever
