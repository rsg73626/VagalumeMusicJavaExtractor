THE WAY THAT YOU LIKE ME (INGLÃŠS)

Show me the way that you like me Baby..
I will always be by your side 

With only you all my dreams have come to me....

No matter what is said to me (now) 

It's no use- I want to say it is a misunderstading
Don't believe the story my friend told you yesterday 

I can't live if I leave you--Oh Yeah--

*Chorus*

Show me the way that you like me Baby..
I will always be by your side 

With only you all my dreams have come to me....
Show me the way that you like me Baby..

Nothing can block me

I want you to be the only one for me. 

Make it right-- Tonight is the night..
Well I can't explain the way I feel It's so hard. 

Yeah Comin' home, comin' home
I always have been good to you, 

Baby all night long..

Forever, ever, ever--
Say you'll be the rhythm of my heart.

To my old girlfriend long ago I said something like this
-I thought my life would end 

There is a love that has a bigger world than you.
It's the last love of my life 

The love that looks at only me 

Nothing can befelt because I even love the scar left in my heart 

--Oh baby-- My life wants to live in her embrace 

Nothing can block me 

Understand I have erased you- Forever 

Tonight is the night--
I'm going to confess the love in my heart 

Yeah-- If you will become my love my bride
I will protect you with everything I have


*Chorus*

I want you to be the only one for me..
Make it right-- Make it right for me--


*Chorus*

Make it right--
