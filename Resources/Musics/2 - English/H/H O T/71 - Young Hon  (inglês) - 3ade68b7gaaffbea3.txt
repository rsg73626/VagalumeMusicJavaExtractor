YOUNG HON  (INGLÃŠS)

I can't live by leaving your side 
It becomes cold, 
can I not see it again 
Even if it becomes darkness 
I can not love

I will not send you for eternity 
Don't you hear me telling you to leave 
Don't ask me anything and leave 
Please just do what I say 
Just this once listen to me 
Why you have to forget me 
I can't explain why I'm crying while I tell you that

But just know this I love you 
Forgive me 
Honestly I could not make you understand 
Leave me 
Please don't try to know anything 
Why can't I tell you 
Now I can't see you anymore 
My heart that has to send you is going crazy

*Chorus*
Just don't cry and close your eyes now 
Do you see me smiling 
I am also so scared 
If this is really the end don't let go of my hand 


Honey it's funny I could still see you clearly 
Tell me what does it take to make a live another day 
And the last thing I gotta say 
Day by day you took my heart away 
Come back 
it's the 4th HOT 
feel the vibe as the the rhythm just tell ya 
Now I lost everything I can not see you 
That's not it 
Don't be hurt 
Even without me my love will be forever

Why can't I tell you 
Now I can't see you anymore 
My heart that has to send you is going crazy

*Chorus*

I had to send you away from my side 
It's the last thing I can do 
Do you know my heart now 
It has become dark 
But I will not leave you for eternity
