TIME WILL TELL (INGLÃŠS)

Yeah it's all right girl You know what's up uh!
I can't end it so easily like this
I'm watching her who is growing distant from me Left alone with nobody,
everyone left me It can not be turned back

I can't end it so easily like this
I'm watching her who is growing distant from me
Left alone with nobody, everyone left me
It can not be turned back

You can leave like that I couldn't forbode that I wouldn't be able to see you again
It's gonna be time will tell
It's to late to even regret it
Goodbye oh baby baby

To you who
I gave everything to how could it end so easily like this 
The times we spent together can not be fulfilled now
Only my wish

Think about it again again on a lonesome night
when you are alone
I can't believe
I don't want to believe your words that said you couldn't come back to me
Tell me anything
Why you had to change
I want to go back to you

My love that had become one moment, even your eyes, now everything cooled off and now you left

It's gonna be time will tell
Exhausted you left me, but now worried
I have to break away from you again but I can't

You, who left like that like that without even turning back, appear and try to persuade me, but it's too late 
Those words are meaningless now
Coming back to me after everything passed by
Words saying that you need me Uh!

I can't understand it anymore 
Now I'm tired inside your repeated lies and actions

I'll forget you now
I wanted you to at least understand a little about my scar and past
I'll have to send you who left leaving a deep scar inside my heart
I'll send you You, who can not have regrets who can not regain are too late
After everything passes you won't be able to come back
Now I'll forget you

Time flowed like that
As if nothing happened
(but you continued to approach me)

After turning around it's too late to regret it
No matter what kind of excuse you make, it can not be turned back

My love that had become one moment, even your eyes,
 now everything cooled off and now you left

You left, but after time passes you will know
Truly just for you~
