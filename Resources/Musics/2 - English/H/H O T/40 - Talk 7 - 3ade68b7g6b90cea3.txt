TALK 7

I have a lot of friends...
I was never lonely so kids that didn't have friends looked strange...
Sometimes I thought the way they were lonely was a definite thing..
One day I recieved a letter..
It looked like a fan letter 
just like the other days..
But when I opened the envelope..
And I read the letter 
I was in regret, 
thinking it would of been better if I didn't open it...
That was fear.. 
That friend didn't have a father..
So she had no other choice but to wear her unni's (older sister) uniform and carry around an old bag.. 
Other friends rejected her saying that kid was dirty 
but that friend said she could bear with that..
But after phys. ed. when she opened her bag to change clothes, 
the only uniform she had, 
the old but special uniform was torn apart 
and when she saw that she couldn't bear with it any more..
That was just not clothes that was torned apart...
It was her future that was torn apart...
And like that she jumped off the roof..
Saying she didn't want to live in a world like this...
The end of the letter was written like this..


Oppa, 
I don't know if this something fortunate or miserable but I didn't die..
Only,
I can't walk or run anymore 
but oppa..
When I go out of the hospital will the world be a little brighter? 
No, 
now will my friends not bother me? 
No..
Now will they speak to me?
