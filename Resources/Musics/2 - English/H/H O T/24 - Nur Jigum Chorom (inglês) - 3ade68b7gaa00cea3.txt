NUR JIGUM CHOROM (INGLÃŠS)

The moment your small and pretty eyes came to me, everything in the world stopped
Carefully, i'm going towards you
I worry because you are still young
Sometimes, i draw beautiful world in your eyes and i'm happy
You don't have to say i already know
At the end of the time where everything stopped, when only our world exists
One sentence i hid from you until now
I love you
Stay by my side like this
Now, i'll tell you the truth
My heart waited so long
I know your lightly shaken heart
Infront of you, i'm lack of everything
But just stay by me for ever
You don't have to say i already know
At the end of the time where everything stopped, when only our world exists
One sentence i hid from you until now
I love you
Stay by my side like this
Even if the my life time ends, my everything is by your side
Now, it looks comfortable like everything in the world is mine
With you, in this world which stopped, none of the words cannot substitute my heart
I love you
Stay by my side like this
I found the love i found the love in you girl i wanna say that my heart will always be for you
I'll be always there for you always always my love
