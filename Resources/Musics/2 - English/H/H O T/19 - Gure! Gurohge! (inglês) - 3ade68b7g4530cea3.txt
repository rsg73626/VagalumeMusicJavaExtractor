GURE! GUROHGE! (INGLÃŠS)

Yo, It's about time to put your tears away don't dispair cause
there always will be someone there don't lose faith trust yourself

I saw your steps without strengths which stopped there like that
It's so hard to stand in the world all alone
Difficult times You won numerous trials
Now, get up with a spirit of the start
With low voice, you can't do anything
Cry towards the days spread in front of you Now
Yes, like that Try smiling once
Look at the days spread in front of you
Open everything inside you Now
Wake up again Fresh start
Store everything inside you
Remember today
In front of the new open world
Now, start all over
You, who tought me how to live
For us to think who we are to you
Like that
So we could only show you our poor-looking sides
To do Like that
So I won't just stand like this
Many people who held me, maintained, and protected me
After all, I won because something nameless inside myself protected me since one day
Like that
You should get up, again
You can't just fall like this
Open your arms and smile wide towards the sky
After many frustrations, you might fall again
Yes Trust yourself hidden inside and stand up Now
Yes, like that Try smiling once
Look at the days spread in front of you
Open everything inside you Now
Wake up again Frest start
Store everything inside you
Remember today
In front of the new open world
So the world in front of you can help make your dreams come true
To do Like that
Same with me
I won't fall down here Not like that
For the people who worried for me
The trust that I could overcome anything at anywhere and the courage
I don't know are breathing next to my side
We'll work together Yes Yes, like that
Yes, like that Get up, again
You are here in this beautiful world
Now, smile like that
You trust yourself
Now, nothing scares me
I love the trust inside you
Remember today
In front of the new open world
Now, start all over
