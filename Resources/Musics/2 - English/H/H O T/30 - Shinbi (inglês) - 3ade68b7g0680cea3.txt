SHINBI (INGLÊS)

You were always there, breathing by my side
Now I can’t see you anymore
It was the day you left me
The day you had no tears
I knew there was no return
You left me coldly and heartlessly
The image of your back is a vision I don’t want to remember

The unspoken words I wanted to say to you
Are left merely as scars
Although it is nothing to you, it cannot be altered with anything in this world
But now, I will try to forget everything and turn around
Like that

Oh! Your face was always dark when you were around me
You never gave me any smiles
I spent nights writing my heart out to you
You never accepted what my heart felt for you

My oath to protect you has broken
I am weary in the times that I cannot go back
I will not show how I have become so defeated and useless to you
I will not let you see me this way, for you
I must erase and forget the memories I had of being next to you

Even the very last of my memories, please erase it
It will be hard to live without you
But don’t leave anything behind, take it all away
I can overcome, even if I am left all alone in this world

I…I…I…
In my quavering memory
You…You…You…
In all the things I have not said
You… Have left me
And I know that you will not be returning to me
In my wanderings, you will never be, as much as I may will for it
You are no more
I am trying to forget you and turn around, like that

Only if you knew what I was going through,
I suffered, I cried, praying every night, hoping that you’ll be back
But I realized that it’ll never be the same

My oath to protect you has broken
I am weary in the times that I cannot go back
I will not show how I have become so defeated and useless to you
I will not let you see me this way, for you

In this world, it will be hard to erase all the memories I had with you
But I will have faith in myself, standing alone in this world
I can endure, without you
I must erase you, I must forget you
It will be hard to live without you
But I will, from the end of my memories, in my will
In this world
