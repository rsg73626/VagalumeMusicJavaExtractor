TOOJI (INGLÃŠS)

[ Rap ] Everyone git it up
Everyone look at ourselves getting lost
One by one, within our dark memories (within) that is spotted with many harmful things.

Everyone git it up
Everyone look around yourselves getting lost
Everybody can't (can't) ignore it now that they are used to the spoiled greed.

[ Rap ] Get lost! I'll tell you exactly how it is, everything that everyone refuses to touch and listen to. You must swallow everything without leaving one behind, so the indignated souls can sleep.

[ English rap ] Give me take knee down just a give me look around so I can cut your T dripping all the P there's no guarantee I don't wanna see you (but) rather epervana from pyunny (one) I'm just gonna knock ya outta say booya

[ Song ] In that incurable sadness
They are once again inside us
I won't just spectate them again
I just vow that today

[ Rap ] Ya! Even the brightest kids' hands get black by the black ammunition, those small hands
And have you ever thought of their lives they will tread on with their black hands after growing up like that?

[ Song ] The place we hoped for
Is becoming just a hope
But I wish we wouldn't lose the last faith
I will live with a heart that's united
For you

[ Rap ] After stepping on each other and hogging everything
As if that wasn't enough, after tempting others'
You kneel down and as if all the memory would be erased, without a sound, you do it again...

[ Song ] The place we hoped for
Is becoming just a hope
But I wish we wouldn't lose the last faith
I will live with a heart that's united
For you

[ Rap ] Everyone git it up
Everyone look at ourselves getting lost
One by one, within our dark memories (within) that is spotted with many harmful things.

Everyone git it up
Everyone look around yourselves getting lost
Everybody can't (can't) ignore it now that they are used to the spoiled greed.
[ Rap ] Get a hold of it!
Did you understand so far, everything that everyone refuses to touch and listen to.
You must swallow everything without leaving one behind, so the indignated souls can sleep.

[ Song ] In that incurable sadness
They are once again inside us
I won't just spectate them again
I just vow that today
