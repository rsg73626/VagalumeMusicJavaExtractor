NA EUI NUH  (INGLÃŠS)

The sorrow reflected in your eyes 
What are you thinking about 
Look at me..
Oh~ what troubles you 
What makes you sorrow 
I'm looking at you 
Can you feel me
My eyes that smile in happiness as I look at you 
Sometimes I become uneasy
The sorrow filled in your eyes 
But I can feel it now 
We will always be one like this

*Chorus*
Close your eyes 
Hold my hand 
Always think of me when you look at me.
I can see it now I remember your love
I am next to you.

*Rap* 
I think it can last forever.
Draw the memories we will make together.
I'm always next to you 
Always happy 
You are together with me under our oath
Your beautiful smile 
You are beautiful 
Your eyes are beautiful 
Right nowwhen you are looking at me with your loving eyes
I am happy.

The day we were apart, 
how much did you think of me. 
Many times I almost cried because I missed you 
Sometimes I become uneasy 
Wondering if all of this is not a dream 
I can really feel this moment 
We will forever be one like this

*Chorus*

Even if time is to flow 
Years flow and everything changes I know that we will be together..
I gather my hands and pray.
I love you

*Chorus*

I only love you 
I love you..
look at me...
Confess to me now..
Be by my side 
Move into my arms..
Remember..
I will always be by your side..
