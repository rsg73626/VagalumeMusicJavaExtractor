HWANHEE (INGLÃŠS)

Where in the world are you 
I worried 
Whether you were happy or miserable from parting with me
You, 
who looked at me and was beautiful, 
disappeared somewhere 
You abandoned me but why are you crying 
Covered by those tears 
I can not see your eyes that protected me 
I can not see them any longer 
I can not see it just a little 
You, 
who I love, 
is no where to be seen
Exhausted I try to forget but in conclusion with my worthless meaningless longing that is endless
I wait for you Woo! (for you still unfinished) 
Is it insufficient with my love 
Why are you going farther away 
Why are you not with me 
Where are you 
Come back to me 
You protect me 
When this moment passes, 
it will just be a memory to you who will forget me in your life, 
but I have become so much like you it can not be erased 
You have become my everything

Baby I'm not ready to live my life steady 
without my lady uh~! 
Think about the way you kiss me girl
why you set me free

The time I was together with you 
Do you, who were everything to me, 
also remember 
The spot that we valued so much (we who were there) 
Do you remember the hot kiss at that place 
(We )We (uh) were happy 
Can you forget (Can you erase it)
Forgive me now (Woah) 
I want you to come back to me uh! (If I could meet you again Woo~Woo~!Woo~!) 
I could't handle it because I have so many things I haven't told you 
There are so many things I couldn't give you~! Uh!
Gradually very slowly you can come to me (I can wait) 
For however long until whenever I can wait
I'll promise It seems I can see you from afar.. 
Can't you hear my earnest voice..
I can't hold out please (you) 
When this moment passes, 
it will just be a memory to you who will forget me in your life, 
but I have become so much like you it can not be erased 
You have become my everything 
So you could laugh as much as my tears that flowed in exhaustion inside the sorrow..
At the place I am usually at 
I will be standing 
I will for you

Surviving lonely days 
only with my prays.. 
Thinking about you in never dies just a memories..
Still lies

My promises, 
that were supposed to make you unbearably happy, 
have broken into peices 
Inside my head and heart it makes me unable to look or grab onto you

Baby I'm not ready to live my life steady 
without my lady 
don't cry baby

As much as those tears flowing down my eyes as I turn around, 
please be happy 
Can you do that
I'll try hard so I can forget you as I live 
As much as I loved you 
Everything of you

Surviving lonely days only with my prays.. 
Thinking about you in never dies just a memories..
Still lies
