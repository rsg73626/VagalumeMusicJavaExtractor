TALK 11

We made you wait so long
I'm always sorry to see all your tired faces
I don't know how to say it in words, but this is one thing I'll never forget

You wrote us such beautiful letters
And those letters made me so happy when I felt tired or when things were tough

Sometimes things made you cry
But we did things through our music that I couldn't have done alone
We have had some big hit songs together
But these songs are just the beginning of how much we care for you all
I love you more than words
And I am more grateful than words can say
And let's always be together
I want to tell you, we can't let things people say hurt us
Now for a second time we will comfort and look after each other
There will never be another one like this, I am so sure of that

<This is because we love you guys>

You kept me going all those times I stayed up all night crying
It is because of the love you guys gave us that all of this has happened to me
We came down this path together
(And we made so many beautiful memories along the way)

Sometimes it is hard for your heart to see me show my sad, tired face to my close friends
But I have learnt things through our music that I couldn't known alone
We have had some big hit songs together
But these songs are just the beginning of how much we care for you all..
I love you more than words
And I am more grateful than words can say
And we are together
I want to tell you, you shouldn't cry when people say that we are going to break up soon
Now wipe away those tears and don't be the one who helps spread all those rumors
When times are tough and you're in a hard place, look at us, listen to us

Your stories are a sincere part of our world
Your letters and small gifts are like a lantern that shows us your feelings
When I sometimes felt tired from our hard schedules, you look at me with your pretty eyes
And then I have the power to get up and carry on
Do you know how grateful I am?
It is as if we are one, with the same feelings
When you worry about us, we are always thinking about you
And we will always be that way
The truth is that nothing can take our place in your hearts
Let us remember our feelings
I, I, I~~~
I love you more than words
I am more grateful than words can say
And we are together
I say we are together
