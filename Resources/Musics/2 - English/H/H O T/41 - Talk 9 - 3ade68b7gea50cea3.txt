TALK 9

I'll love you until there is no more love
When you know that only words of truth remain
Then you know you have already become a man
We sent these hot songs into your minds
Just look at what you've accomplished so far
Now go on before these smiles dissapear
Don't forget all this beauty we've seen
A woman gets her sadness and happiness from a man
With our five fingers we can draw five lines
To people who are crying alone in the dark
When the tears and the bruises and the hard stares turn to hatred
Let that hatred become love
Toss away that glass, I care for you
You don't need that drink, you care for me
We have a love that will last forever
And finally we'll understand that this is what God had planned for us...
