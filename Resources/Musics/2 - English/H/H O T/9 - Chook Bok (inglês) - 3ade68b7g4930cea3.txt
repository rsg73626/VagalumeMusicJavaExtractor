CHOOK BOK (INGLÃŠS)

Kang Ta)Yes I will do that
Until the time you were not here
I think I have been waiting for you, who were somewhere else
For a long time as I longed for you with many tears
I wandered for a while

Hee Jun)Do you remember
My timid appearance in front of you I, who only smiled
The shy confessed I vowed quietly as I looked at your twinkling eyes
Do you remember also

Kang Ta)Without change let us protect each other like right now
The future layed out in front of us is beautiful
As much as the time I was lonely, I love you
Until forever stay by my side

Tony)I know you are exhausted
Lean on me right now
Don't say anything
I will protect you
I, who can wipe off your exhausted tears
Do you know I am happier than ever

Kang Ta)Without change let us protect each other like right now
The future layed out in front of us is beautiful
As much as the time I was lonely, I love you
Until forever stay by my side

Kang Ta)No matter what ordeals come I'm always next to you
Nothing can block our love
I, who was alone and waited for you during all that time by myself, does not exist anymore
Everything of myself I give to you

Woo Hyuk & Jae Won) Exhausted and lonely I was led to the world that I dreamed of by you, who I met
That day when I was the happiest ever since I was born,
That day where the stars in the sky were exceptionally bright
