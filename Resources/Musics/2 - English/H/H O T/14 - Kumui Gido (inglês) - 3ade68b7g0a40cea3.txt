KUMUI GIDO (INGLÃŠS)

When I was collapsing alone at the end of the world your warm breath held my hand
The reason I could defeat this rough world was because of you who protected me

For you who melted my cold hands saying you would never leave me I pray
that even if I'm born again I'll be with you

I'll always be grateful
For the many days that are left to unfold in this world where I met you
I'll gather my hands and promise I love you
Now always and forever by your side

Never gonna say good-bye
Never gonna say good-bye

Your tears were what comforted me who was always alone

Sometimes I hated myself for not being able to do anything for you, but
I pray that no matter where you are, you'll be happy

I'll always be grateful
For the many days that are left to unfold in this world where I met you
I'll gather my hands and promise I love you
Now always and forever by your side

Now I won't cry alone at the end of the world
As I always look at your beautiful eyes I'll protect you now

I'll always be grateful
For the many days that are left to unfold in this world where I met you
I'll gather my hands and promise I love you
Now always and forever by your side

Now always and forever by your side.....
