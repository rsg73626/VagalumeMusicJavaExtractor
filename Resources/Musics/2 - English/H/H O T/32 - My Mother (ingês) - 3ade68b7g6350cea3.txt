MY MOTHER (INGÃŠS)

(*)Because I could not express to you my heart for you,
My heart always stayed only inside of me.
I won't make you sad any more now.
I love you. Till the end of the world.

A while back I visited somewhere - my mother.
I was utterly worned out by my tears, sorrow filled up to my head.
[Her] Laughter emitted always unchangeably still.

But before I can even see her, I was unwelcomed from the door.
Too sad, want to cry, want to die.
I can't stand it like this any more, can't overcome it.
You who have gone far from me.

I made too much trouble. I only thought of myself.
This is not it, I felt and realized now only after you were gone,
Too foolish I am.

repeat (*)

You had nights when you cried endlessly, didn't you.
And in the dark, a very dark corner of a room, you stroked my head
And told me you loved me, you were sorry.

After that after that night, that dark night, you aparted far from me.
I was too lonely and forlorn. I missed you too much.

Love you sitting by the window all day
thinking of you watching the days go by, I started to cry
so I tried to stop my tears for years but it never goes away
I miss you mother

repeat (*)

At first, I didn't know where you've gone.
By father's oversight, left all alone in the dark night.
Just thinking about that pain, my heart bleeds in me.
Your pain, I will now soothe all.

Now I know a little, your love for me. (Your love)
I probably look young still,
But now I will abide by you.

repeat (*)

(No way No way) Within your love
(No way No way) I'll abide by you always
(No way No way) Your love
(No way No way) I'll abide by you always
