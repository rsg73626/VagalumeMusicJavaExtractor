ILLUSION (INGLÃŠS)

Dopeman, Dopeman, smoke till you try will let you so high
Dopeman, Dopeman, what you want is you what you never gonna get
In my time which can't go back
You in my consciousness which stopped
In front of my obscure thoughts
Memories in my illusion which got locked up again
In front of you breathing was useless
Memories of my soul were ruined
I can't protect myself anymore
Obscure illusion in dark approach in a short time
I can't stand it anymore
In forgotten times
In painful consciousness rationality never exists
I'm falling down
Please hold me
To throw me away now To punish me
The time I waited is so long
Remember people with hopes on me watching me
Uh! From where did the things go wrong
Where is the way for me to go
Living as child of darkness Smell of blood
Kill myself who lives in me
I don't know what to do anymore now
The feeling tightens more and more Very deep
Take me to a far away place
I wanna get high So, high Sup dog what you need you oh shit onetime
If you wanna smoke cane you must be insane never gonna get away with the pain
In front of you breathing was useless
Memories of my soul was ruined
I can't protect myself anymore
Obscure illusion in dark approach in a short time
I can't stand it anymore
In forgotten times
In painful consciousness rationality never exists
I'm falling down
Please hold me
My happy days
If I can only turn back
I want to born again in this world
For all the people who protected me
I want to get myself back
Always look at them Look at the lights going off
Throw you away and will they and you be one
You got dirty Who are you trying to lean against
I had to throw away everything I had like that
World which I will make now into the dark future
Doing that shit with money you got searching for the piece of rock Yo dock
Obscure illusion in dark approach in a short time
I can't stand it anymore
In forgotten times
In painful consciousness rationality never exists
I'm falling down
Please hold me
