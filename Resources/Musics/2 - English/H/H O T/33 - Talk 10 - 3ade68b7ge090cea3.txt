TALK 10

The spaceship left when I was 17 years old...
All alone..I'm left in an empty crater..
The surrounding is all gray... or jet black darkness..
Inside a nameless planet capsule that has no TV 
I am longing for the Earth..
The smell of dirt I passed by carelessly..
the rock..that caught on the tip of my foot.. grass.. and even the fly.. and people.. 
Even my friends that I hated..
I gradually return to the past..
There is no future..
It seems like I have sunk into the darkness of space.. Escape.. Escape..A sound coming from somewhere..
Right now, as I match the frequency of the radio..
I am dreaming to escape.
