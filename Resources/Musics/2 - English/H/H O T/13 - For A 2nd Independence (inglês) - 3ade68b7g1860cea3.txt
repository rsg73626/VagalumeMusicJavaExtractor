FOR A 2ND INDEPENDENCE (INGLÃŠS)

Now everything is over 
It's more miserable that I was left alive 
How do I have to start everything over 
When I open my eyes it was you I saw reflected in my tears 
Once again this will not happen In front of us, 
who are breathing 
You people remember today 
We will step on you and stand up again 
The past can not be remembered 
This doesn't have anything to do with you guys 
The nation that fell ghastly and the ripped and scattered tears in front of them 
How can it be forgotten. 
With the rage rising from deep inside my heart 
I follow you, 
who screams inside the misery, 
The road that is becoming dark again today 
I absent mindedly again walk 
To those people up there who roam in our nation, 
That struggles inside the pain that is to be returned again,
they bows their head and pledge once again.
Uh! 815 a 2nd independence 
I wanted to believe it was only for a moment 
After dreaming a dream the sunlight was going to shine 
I pray like this but what about the rain deep inside my heart
Everyone needs to know what our mother or that mother the mother of another mother had to bear with 
Their soundless cry 
They had to kneel down 
All our pride, 
The flowers inside them gradaually wither away together 
Also burying the names of love we had to send them inside
Eternity forever Again not able to grab on 
We wanted to raise them up but we couldn't do anything 
The past can not be remembered 
This doesn't have anything to do with you guys
The nation that fell ghastly and the ripped and scattered tears in front of them 
How can it be forgotten. 
Our name name that our nation found we can not lose the name of our homeland again go~!~!
We, as one, 
With just one we will repay you guys 
The flame that doesn't blow out with just the natiolism inside our hearts 
With just that (Yo checkin representing by ya yeah) 
Comeback Comeback Comeback uh~ 
815 Once again this will not happen In front of us, 
who are breathing
You people remember today 
We will step on you and stand up again
