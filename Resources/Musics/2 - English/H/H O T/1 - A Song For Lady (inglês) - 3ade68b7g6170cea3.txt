A SONG FOR LADY (INGLÃŠS)

I'm sorry
for the scar I have given you,
For the tears that have rolled down
your white cheeks
Forgive me.
You must forgive me.
I'm so afraid that you will leave me,
Cause I love you so much.
When you weren't by my side,
I was lonely and enervating.
As I was standing under a storm and being hit by the rain,
I cried endlessly.

*Chorus*
I love you.
I miss you.
I promise that I will make you happy as much as you did for me.
You will no longer be tired or sad.

I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. and I love.
I don't know how many times I have sang this song,
since the tears never stopped flowing.
I missed you so much today
I held your picture tightly in my two hands.
The tears are rolling down your face.
Now you are crying too.

*Chorus*

I believe that you will come back to me.
I love you~

*Chorus*

Once, Just once, embrace me.
For that reason, I wont cry anymore.
You are my final love.
I'm praying that you will never forget me.
