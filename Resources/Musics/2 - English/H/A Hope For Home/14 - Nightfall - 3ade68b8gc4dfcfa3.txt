NIGHTFALL

The sun is the method by which we see all â€“ truth embodied. We see a man standing on a hill in the dark. His eyes are glowing.

No rising sun, all is cold. The only light held in our eyes: It brings forth a new way of life.

And we shall burn our pyres when the morning comes and welcome a new age.

When the night falls we know, we will never fear a reckoning again.
