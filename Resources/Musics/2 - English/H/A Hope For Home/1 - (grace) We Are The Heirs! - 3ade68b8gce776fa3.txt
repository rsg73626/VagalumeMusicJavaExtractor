(GRACE) WE ARE THE HEIRS!

We were searching for a way out
We took things too far, too far for far too long.
And still after our wounds heal, we're still haunted
Haunted by these things
Will our defenses hold and keep us safe through the night?

What remains of what's been said
Could never fill the void inside your head 
(run away from deadly words!) 
And I swear, your prayers will all be heard! 
Just lift your head and close your eyes

We're running with rusty gears, we're breaking down
Please, don't let this die
We only have so long in this life
So find your heart and hope for better days
Because only words can bring us down
We're only asking for tonight!

Let's leave this place behind, before its too late to decide!
Though some will say they find it better
The road we're on is winding down
Aand it will tear it down to the marrow
I feel it welling up inside
So please, don't let this die!

Lift your head, savor this moment, savor tonight
