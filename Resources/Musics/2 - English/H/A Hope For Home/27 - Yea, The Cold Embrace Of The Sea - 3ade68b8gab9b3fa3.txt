YEA, THE COLD EMBRACE OF THE SEA

I heard the sound of ten thousand voices calling out
And as waves crash down, their bodies pulled from the ground
But I saw you there, with your feet firmly planted down 
Could this be the end?

I feel a cold embrace as I'm washed away
As fear grips my heart, it swallows me
Could this be your grace?

What a pitiful life I lead 
I've grown too weak and land is out of reach 
But upon the sea, your figure calls to me 
And i can't breathe until you free me 
Can this life we lead mean anything at all? 
As the waves pull me down 
Can all these days mean anything at all?

I have now come to accept my fate 
For i was not made to tread forever

Crash down and break my bones 
Lay me to rest in the depths of the sea 
Leave me to mend in the waves of your sea
Crash down, break me, make me into what you want me to be
