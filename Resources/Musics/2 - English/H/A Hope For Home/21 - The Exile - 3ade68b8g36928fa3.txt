THE EXILE

Where have You gone? And where am I without you
This heart that once burned with hope
Won't beat without your mercy
Wash away all of this, bring me back to You.

So here I remain, so far away.
There is nothing at all that can bring be back to You
But my own will, but my own heart, my own hands.
But is it too little too late?

This distance makes my heart sour.
I am so far away.
Distance from that which I desire and what leads me astray.
I am so far away.
