CASTING LIGHT THROUGH SUCH THIN SHADES

We're casting light through such thin shades, and i am tired
My legs fail, i cant move another inch without you
These are the things that will tell you if you are alive
I always hear my heart is in my wrist
But mine is in my chest
So love, we're almost home

Open up these walls and let each other in
We will live again
I require your grace to see whats inside
Trust your eyes and find your faith again
Burning heart to lift you off the ground
And let this life begin
And i'll break these walls to get to you
I will never leave you

Stand up and reach out, your faith has made you well
The vultures have gathered, but there is time enough to tell
If the road makes us weary, we'll lift you if you fall
But is there time enough to tell?

Don't lose hope, your wrists are scarred
But hold out strong
My son you'll change the world
Find your way back home
From birth he has made mention of your name
For i swear to you, your heart is in your chest

Why cant we say, "your love means everything to me?"

"your eyes have opened wide
These shades cannot hold back this light
Your voice can reach the multitudes", so take these words
To heart, and reach out for your life
We have so far to go
