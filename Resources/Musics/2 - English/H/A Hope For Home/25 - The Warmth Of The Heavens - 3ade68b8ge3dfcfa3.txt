THE WARMTH OF THE HEAVENS

Many times it is said that belief in the otherworldly is foolish, since we have no direct evidence or widely accepted philosophical proof for the existence of what we cannot see. For thousands of years man thought the earth was the center of the universe, our only method of gathering information was to simply just look up. When our method for understanding changes, the thing which we are trying to understand does not change in its nature. Our limited understanding of Truth has no bearing on whether or not Truth exists.

With arms outstretched and hope intact I fix my gaze to the stars above.
I canâ€™t feel their warmth, burning on my skin, but still they shine, with no need to question them.
