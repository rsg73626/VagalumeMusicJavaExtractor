THE HUMAN PROJECT LIVES

There is blood on my hands, but there is a reason for what we've done
Don't look back on all the problems its caused
The problems that we've solved will justify
So turn a blind eye

Oh god! Why have you forsaken us?
These illusions make for such great escapes!
Though every synapse leads to something great
We fear the means which hope does not stray away from my body
Take me away from this place, and I'll follow you to the end!

And we're here pounding on these walls but noone hears your cries
Lord we wait for your return!
We've lost our way! We dig our own graves!
This is a place of broken hearts and broken dreams
And it's killing me to watch it bleed
Still pounding on these walls, and there is nothing new
Have we bled ourselves dry?
Our own tounges deceive us! 
We dig our own graves!

And it wont be long, it wont be long
We wait for your return
Our tounges are tied, we are deceived!
We are decieved by the grace of man
And can we be redeemed?

Our hearts grow cold,
But oursalvation lies just past the waters edge!
Can these soiled hands hold me up in time for you to return?
O how thou art destroyed, o city renown
