KYLE

On the day you left I packed my bags and went home
Because fear has no place here
So I'll follow your lead and live my life like you
Always pushing forward with the weight of the world holding me back

It's time to stand up and walk!
The higher I climb, the air gets so thin, so thin!
But your love is my lungs, and I am breathing, breathing!

And though our bodies will come to pass
We will live on in hearts and minds
We will not die even when we cease to breathe
But in life, it is so hard

The very air I breathe seems to suffocate me!
It's a constant battle, still I stand up and walk! 
For the higher I climb the air gets so thin
But your love is my lungs and i am breathing!

I climb this mountain, the path I walk is plagued with doubt
But I will not fail!
I will not fall down! 
And I'll carry on until I hear you call me home
I will ascend!
On shaking legs with heavy steps 
I'll bear this cup that weighs me down
But I won't fall
Oh god, don't let me fall!
"I try, to hold myself up but I can't go on unless you are here with me!"
