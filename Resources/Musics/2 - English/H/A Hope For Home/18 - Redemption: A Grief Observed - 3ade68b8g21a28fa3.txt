REDEMPTION: A GRIEF OBSERVED

Come, now child! All of this is temporary:
I am merely a vessel bearing this curse
And I can only run for so long
Come now Lord, your dwelling place is now with men
Send your rain, then open up the sky!

They say you're coming soon, but Lord, it's been so long
I'm starting to lose sight
The solace of licking my wounds has led me to compromise my faith
In all you stood to create

There's no sun or moon, for You will burn so bright
We will become shadows in the warmth of your light

I'm tired of being so thin, so in need of constant reassurance 
To fill the holes in my chest, and I'm cracking
I'm finally breaking
Oh, let me crumble 'till I'm nothing more than dust
And remake me to withstand myself and this separation
They say all we have is ourselves, but this is so obviously not enough
So many times I've felt like giving up and I'm holding on by my fingertips
And I feel like screaming I feel so alone
And though I've heard your voice before, for my feeble mind
I fear it is not enough

Catch glimpse of a falling star
Illuminating the depths of our world
And burning away the pestilence of mankind
Oh my god, send your rain!
There will be no more death or mourning, no more crying or pain
For the old order of things has passed away. Write this down:

All of this has passed away! It is done!
