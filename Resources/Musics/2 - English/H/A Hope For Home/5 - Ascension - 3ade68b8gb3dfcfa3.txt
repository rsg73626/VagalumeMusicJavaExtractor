ASCENSION

Facing death, the man finally comes to understand what gives his life meaning. There is something beyond his temporal material existence: this Truth gives us meaning, and it is real. The man dies.

Can this be my only home? Planes of dust, and rising seas.
I will release the bonds, but will this set me free?

Awake, climb, all will fade.
In time, we will understand that all we can see is not the end to all that will be.

Mistaken for the final rest â€“ the collapse of lungs and one last breath.
All reveals the trail to a door ahead. Collect consciousness, prepare to tread endless voids.
