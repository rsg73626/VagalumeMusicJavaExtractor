OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT

Tonight is windind down
You're holding on for one last breath 
As this vicious circle pulls you down

You're holding close to what you see tonight
Another darkened sky, another wasted night
And it wont be too long until you find out why
Your heart still feels empty after nights of lies

And i have learned to stop running in circles 
And walk this world with the gift of knowing
That we were made for something more!

Don't say a word, if we decieve ourselves
We might even believe that what we do is well
And do you know just what you're searching for?
Or can you fill this hole with hate until you hope no more?

And i have learned to stop running in circles 
And walk this world with the gift of knowing
That we were made for something more!

Every time that I fall there have been hands to lift me up
They lift me still

Though this vicious cycle can bring you down
But stand your ground, down give up
And we will stand apart in the end
