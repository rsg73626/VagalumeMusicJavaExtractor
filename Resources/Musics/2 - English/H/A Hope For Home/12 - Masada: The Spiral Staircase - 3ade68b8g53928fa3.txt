MASADA: THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

Ransom my hope. Set me free,
And set my eyes to see what you have in store for me.
I'm on the edge of all of this, captured by selfishness,
But offering my one last breath to ransom my faithfulness.

With our hands we have ravaged the world.
Time and time again, I have drowned in affliction.
A shell of a man. Take this body, this waste of breath.
A shell of a man. I have served my time.
This body is a tomb. I'm still waiting for your fire.

My blood boils, I've watched out foundations crumble beneath our feet.
My blood boils. Still we plead for sympathy,
Knowing very well we've played the foe for too long.

Savior! Redeemer! Redemption! Rapture! Armageddon!
With arms outstretched to You, I will welcome the end!
