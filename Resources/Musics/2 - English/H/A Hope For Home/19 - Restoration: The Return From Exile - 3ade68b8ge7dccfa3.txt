RESTORATION: THE RETURN FROM EXILE

There is nothing that I desire more than to be with You
Will you remember me and help me find my way back?
Will you remember me?
My heart was once led astray, but with new eyes 
I can see that you were never far away
My own heart, my own hands, my own will
With your grace it?s not too late
T?was distance that turned my heart sour
And I shall not live in fear today
You are all that I desire, and in my final hour 
I will not stray from your side
I find rest in you alone
I am home!
