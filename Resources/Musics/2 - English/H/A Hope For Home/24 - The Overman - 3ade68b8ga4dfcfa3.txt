THE OVERMAN

"Behold, I teach you the overman. The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The overman shall be the meaning of the earth!" - Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra. Nietzsche’s overman embodies what we must become in this world with no god. The next stage of humanity, greater than man. All we have is now, we must then reject other-worldliness, and become the "meaning of the earth."

We’ve broken the binding chain. The earth cannot contain.
Our arms stretch past the sky. Now as gods we all shall rise.

Exaltation in the least of these: We are all that will be.
Now awake and find the dream conceived, for we are the measure of all.

This is the dawn of time, this is the end of the world.
We will transcend ourselves, and we will conquer them both.

Our commission sealed the grave. Raise your glasses now it is done.
And with nothing above or below, upon salted ground we rise.

This is the dawn of time, this is the end of the world.
We will transcend ourselves, and we will conquer them both.
For we must shed our skin, become as gods in the light.
If we’re to find our own way, rewrite our paths from the start.

Rise up as gods. Rise up. Adorned as gods.
