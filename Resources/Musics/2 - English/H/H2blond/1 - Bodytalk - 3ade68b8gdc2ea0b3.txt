Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication
And this one is about
Kids, and pets, and a situation
That we can all understand, whether we have
Kids or pets or neither
It's from a man in cincinatti, ohio
And here's
What he writes
Dear casey, this may seem to be a strange
Dedication request, but
I'm quite sincere, and it'll mean a lot if you play it
Recently, there was
A death in our family
He was a little dog named snuggles
But he was most
Certainly a part of

Let's come, start again
From comin' out of the record. play the
Record, okay? please

Get on the frequency that I'm on
Ya dumb son of a bitch!
That's the letter u, and the numeral 2
The four-man band features adam
Clayton on bass, larry mullen on drums
Dave evans, nicknamed "the edge", on
This is bullshit! nobody cares!
These guys are from england, and who gives a
Shit? (oh... yeah...)
Just a lot of waste, names that don't mean diddly-shit!
(aye, for sure
For sure, you guys don't know
Where he's at, you don't know shit about)
This is bullshit this is bullshit
(sounds like he's portable, too)
Who gives a shit?
Who gives a shit? (yeah, it is close)
Diddly-shit diddly-shit diddly-shit diddly-shit
(yeah... damn
Right) nobody cares!
(getting stronger all the time here)
Snuggles. (yeah) snuggles
(oh yeah) snuggles. (oh yeah, okay)
He was a little dog named snuggles
This is american top furty
This is american top 40. this is
Bullshit!
(... can't get a hold of me, ya little fuckin' twerp
Cocksucker... fuck you!)
(when we find you, we want your blood)
Here we go with the shit
Tryin' to find him, ooh when we find
Him, you guys have a fuckin'?
You couldn't find your fuckin' asshole
If your fuckin' butt wasn't connected to it!
Bunch of fuckin' white-ass
Honkies
You can't find shit, stupid bastards
I wanna meet you
But I don't think you've got the fuckin'
Balls
You haven't found anybody, anywhere, anytime
You never have given out
His correct address, his fuckin' right-on
Description, or a car, or nothin'
You got some fuckin' bullshit info heh
You haven't done shit with 'em
We didn't find you yet?
We really didn't find you the first time?
When was the first time, huh?
When was the first time?
You never give out his address
Or what he looks like, and his
Car, and all that fuckin' information
Goddamn, you got somebody there, I
Don't know who, but go ahead
Give all that shit out, why don't you go over
There and knock on his fuckin' door man
Ya, ya think you know where he's
At and all this shit

When you come out of those
Up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's
Impossible to make those transitions
And then ya gotta go into somebody
Dying
Goddammit if we can't come out of a slow record
I don't understand it
Why are we doing these instrumentals too
Cause we got 'em?
I don't understand it
(this is also nothing new.)
I don't understand it
(this is also nothing new.)
I don't understand it
(... you cocksucker!)
I think that people read more
Into the music that's really there
Will somebody find out the goddamn answer?
In the 50's, they considered it vulgar
And despicable to have songs
Like "teach me tonight"
"let's do it" by cole porter... "all of you" by
Cole porter, those were considered
Euphemisms for something dirty
Who gives a shit?
Some vulgar, dirty act
Diddly-shit
The kingston trio sang a song
That used the word "damn". it was
Banned on the radio
Goddammit
In the 60's, there was a song called
"louie louie" (goddammit)
Played upside back (goddammit)
Every way they could play it, looking for
The dirty message (goddammit)
They never found the dirty message... the
Fcc was brought in
Oh fuck!
Uh, in the 70's, people went through
The same period; looking for
The dirtiness of songs
Satan! hail satan!
I... I... I... I really don't think
That the satanic message is there
(go on, fuckin' find him, man) snuggles
Be prepared to meet your maker (fuck!)
I'm after your ass, boy?
Snuggles
Definitely. meet me at morley's
I'll personally meet you
(fuck!) you'll see me (snuggles.)
I'll be wearin' a red and white baseball
Cap, says abc auto parts on it
(okay) can't miss me, son. (okay)
Oh, sounds like a real fancy dresser now
Doesn't he? (okay)
I'm gonna whup your fuckin' ass
Okay, I want a goddamn concerted
Effort to come out of a record that
Isn't a fucking up-tempo record
Everytime I do a goddamn death dedication!
It's the last goddamn time
I want somebody use his fuckin' brain, to not
Come out of a goddamn record
That is uh, that that's up-tempo and I gotta
Talk about a fuckin' dog dying!
(?) (super shithead again)
(who knows, you might be... town)
Whoah, this is fuckin' ponderous, man
Ponderous, fuckin'
Ponderous. (eat shit and die, richard)
This is american top furty
