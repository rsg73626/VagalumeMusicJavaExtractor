Hey mister policeman 
Don't tell I 'bout your law. 
Hey mister politician 
Don't push I inna hole. 
Hey mister preacherman 
Don't teach I how to pray. 
Hey mister general 
I'm not your stupid soldier. 

Ref: 'Cause we got soul, 
'Cause we got soulfire. 
We got soul, 
'Cause we got soulfire. 
'Cause we got soul, 
We got soulfire. 
'Cause we got soul, 
We got soulfire.

Hey mister policeman 
You'll never catch my spliff. 
Hey mister politician 
Don't tell I how to live. 
Hey mister preacherman 
I don't hear what you say. 
Hey mister general 
War is not my way.
