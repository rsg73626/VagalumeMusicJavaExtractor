WHEN IS NO MUSIC

Sleep, stand, smoke, joke, 
Ride, drive, smile, cry, 
Drink, think, love, sing, 
Take, make, wait, break, 
Sleep, stand, smoke, joke, 
Ride, drive, smile, cry, 
Sit, eat, drink, think, 
See, be, give, live. 

Ref: Ooooh, but when is no music, I can't do this, I can't do this. 

For you and me and all of us opportunity 
To stand up tall and say no more. 
No more lies, no more brutality, money power and control, 
Does everybody know? It's a system with no flow, 
So stand up tall, stand up tall and say no more. 
My futuristic goal: new friendly generation 
With opportunity in intelligent community. 
We can build a fresh reality based on what we know 
'Cause we got the flow, check the impact, hear the sound. 
Everyone's above the ground. 
I say on the go: deep in your conscious dig the flow 
Habakuk, that's the show, out, out, out of control. 
Let your mind go, let it roll. 
Free choice and legalize, hear the sound, modernize. 
Way of life, freak nation, love sensation, 
God's perspective stimulation.
