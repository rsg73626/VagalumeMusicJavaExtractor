ALREADY HOME

Packed my bags and kissed your cheek	
turned around so I didn't see you cry, you cry	
sometimes you just can't explain	
the reasons why you have to say goodbye,goodbye	
	
It took something, it took falling,	
it took distance, it took time,	
it took a lot of getting lost to realize	
I was already home, right where I was supposed to be	
	
You were right in front of me	
I was not alone	
I was already home, sometimes you're too close to see	
the one thing that you really need has been there all along	
it took leaving you to know, I was already home	
	
It took a long long road to see,	
what matters most in life to me was gone was gone	
but i thought what I was looking for	
was right here waiting at your door	
I was wrong, so wrong	
	
It took tumbling, it took falling,	
it took distance, it took time,	
it took a lot of getting lost to realize	
I was already home, right where I was supposed to be	
	
You were right in front of me	
I was not alone	
I was already home, sometimes you're too close to see	
the one thing that you really need has been there all along	
it took leaving you to know, I was already home	
	
I was so caught up in the thrill of	
something different something, something new,	
it took a lot of missing you to see the truth	
I was already home, right where I was supposed to be	
	
You were right in front of me	
I was not alone	
I was already home, sometimes you're too close to see	
the one thing that you really need has been there all along	
it took leaving you to know, I was already home	
it took leaving you to know	
I was already home	
I was already home
