AMARTE DUELE

I love you from here to mars
Love hurts so much not to do that
Quererte and touching love hurts
I love you from here to mars
If people follow our steps
I ask that you not watch the clock
And though it pains me to stay

Love hurts and I want to take you to mars quererte
If the world does not conspire you can not love
I wish mars and take you quererte
Escapare you to mars
I do not mind anything you may want to
Your sister but said he did not feel what you say and it hurts me

Love hurts and I want to take you to mars quererte
If the world does not conspire you can not love
I wish mars and take you quererte (x2)
And love hurts
And love dueleeleelee
