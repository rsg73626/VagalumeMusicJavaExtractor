I WANT TO BE A COWBOY SWEETHEART

I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
I wann learn to rope and ride
I wanna ride through the plains and the desert
Out west of the great divide
I wanna hear the coyotes singing
As the sun sets in the west
I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life I love the best.

Yodelei yodelei yodelei
Yodeleieieie yodelououou
Yodelei yodelei yodelei

I wann ride a paint
Moce it at a run
I wanna feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles away from all
Movin' in the cowman's face
I wann pillow my head
Beneath the open sky
As the sun sets in the west
I wanna strum my guitar and "yodel-le-hee-hee"
That's the life I love the best

Yodelei yodelei yodelei
Yodeleieieie yodelououou
Yodelei yodelei yodelei
