HIS EYES ON THE SPARROW

Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven and home

When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is he
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches over me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow

And I know he watches
He watches me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow

And I know he watches me
He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me
He watches me
He watches me, I never thought
He watches me
