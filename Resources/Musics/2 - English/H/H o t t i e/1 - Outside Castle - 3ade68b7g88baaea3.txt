OUTSIDE CASTLE

Hee jun)
Oh! i wanted to resemble everything of yours.
I prayed endlessly (don't go away)
But to me, it was just a wish
And everyone left me.

Rap)
This world is so hard to live
Is everyone trying to close their eyes?
I am looking at everything in this world with darkness
For everything,
Just to remain surviving,
I, different from everything of yours
Exhausted from the writhing in my heart everyday (always)
Different gaze from you guys
Look at me with prejudice
Solitarily among people that do not even care
I am living a lonely life
But still the reason i live,
What makes me live,
Is because there is love, hope and love alive in my heart.

Chorus)
We must show in our hearts (we must show)
That there was forgotten love (that there was love)
So we won't exhaust or fall down (you~)
We will live as one.

Hee jun)
Na na in this world
I've lost myself without love.
Na na was i struggling that much?

Rap)
For you
Everything from me
Heart that's put out
Torn heart
I'll believe that everything happened because of me.
For you
Everything from me
Keep your game tight, for your right
Nigga don't you wanna fight back!

Kang ta)
I desire that the day i could actually live comes
So i won't be all lonely
With your love and your faith
So we could live

Chorus)
We must show in our hearts (we must show)
That there was forgotten love (that there was love)
So we won't exhaust or fall down (you~)
We will live as one.

So we won't exhaust or fall down
We will live as one.
