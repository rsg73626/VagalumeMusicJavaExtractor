HOMEGROWN

Into the dark
I found you by the lake
We were so close
But I couldn't bear the weight

Cause you were a shadow
And I left you in the shade
I was still running
From all of my mistakes

Cut to the fallout
when the silence stole our words
I was still fighting
For all that you deserved

Although it seems likely
That I left before the storm
The truth is I couldn't
Leave you wanting more

I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost
I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost

I stay homegrown

I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost
I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost

It was the winter
that shivered up my spine
It was the winter
that left us both behind

The lake didn't cover
Only came to bear the sand
A bruise left by lovers
A bruise left by lovers

I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost
