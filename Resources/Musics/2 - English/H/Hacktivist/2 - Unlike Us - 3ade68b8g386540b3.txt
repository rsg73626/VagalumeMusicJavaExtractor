UNLIKE US

It's a blitz when they're hearing us
A riff so serious
In a total eclipse
Am I clear enough
Vocals skipping to the kick drums
Kick back with a six pack and a big bud
Do shows and we get love
Even though there is friction
Some don't wanna listen
There's a hole in the system
Try get to grips
I'll catch your fist and snap your wrist
Music is dope in my veins
Can you handle this
So sick I need psycho-analysis
I'm an anarchist
Far from a pacifist
We rep hacktivist - influential
With tunes so powerful
Set the beginning of change

It's a blitz when they're hearing us
Fights break out because of us
Chaos we're tearing up
We're down to the next show and it's kicking off
Can't get more real than this
Aim high like the pyramids
I'm a badboy lyricist
Grooves so tight are you feeling this
Haters step back coz you're taking the piss
Ain't got no time for your shit
We cause a commotion
We're smashing the scene
We're drawing in closer
The crowds will follow us
Sick of the mundane
Hacktivist - influential
With tunes so powerful
Set the beginning of change

We're the lyricists
For the hypocrites
We're too sick at this
There's no hit and miss
We're the lyricists
You're the hypocrites
We're too sick at this
There's no matching this
