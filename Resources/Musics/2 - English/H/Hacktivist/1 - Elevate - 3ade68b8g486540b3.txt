ELEVATE

I wanna take down who's in power
Like ground zero
Two twin towers
The president was a coward
Trying to take what's ours
Spend money on wars
Watch bullets get showered
But things ain't gonna change in a matter of hours
Until we turn up at the White House
Whole crowds of us
These suits & ties couldn't walk in our trousers - nah
It's riot gear when they surround us
I'm a pioneer
Hacktivist - we are the founders
The sound of twenty five thousand voices raised in anger
If only you could see it from our angle
Another budget cut
Another community centre shut
Dismantled
The system over-run by the power of the gun
Families bleed left with no-one
It's time for change
Time to elevate to a higher place
This world's gone insane
What happened to the right side of the brain?
This mask covers our face
Stand up and say goodbye to this daylight robbery of lives
The elite gotta do their time
Set 'em up for the firing line
Too quick to point the finger
Too quick to pull the trigger
Slaughter the innocent
I see no sense

We fight fire with fire
We won't burn
A middle finger for liars that won't learn
We stand firm

There's strength in numbers
We're ninety nine, they're one
For the suits up high there's no-where to hide or run
We flow through the streets like blood
Hats down, hoods up
The system's fucked
What I see is corrupt
Learn who to trust
H won't give up
They don't move in our circle
Stand up & listen
We're breaking the rules
Never fall, stay strong
Eternal inferno
We stand tall raising a torch
Coz we got that lyrical force for the side that you walk
Bodies lined out in chalk for supporting the cause
We settle the score
Fight! Coz this is our war

We fight fire with fire
We won't burn
A middle finger for liars that won't learn
We stand firm

We will stand firm

The system's over-run by the power of the gun
Families bleed left with no-one
It's time for change, time to elevate to a higher place
The world's gone insane
What happened to the right side of the brain?
Straight
Systems over-run by the power of the gun
Families bleed left with no-one
It's time for change, time to elevate to a higher place
The world's gone insane
What happened to the right side of the brain?
