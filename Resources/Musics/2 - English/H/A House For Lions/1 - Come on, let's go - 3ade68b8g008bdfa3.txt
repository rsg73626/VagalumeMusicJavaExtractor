COME ON, LET'S GO

I don't even know your name
If you wanna go downtown
We could start a whole new band
We could play songs around

I like to sing
So c'mon to the ..

We could make a ...
We could make the old bells clank
We could runaway tonight

I like to drive
All the mistakes 
That I've made in the lane
Or the escape in the fence

My family shamed on me
For thinking that way

I'm just like them
But I'm ok

Would you love me anyway?

And maybe when the streets turn grey
I could find a lee beat free

If I've got a place downtown
Would you share a bed with me?

I sleep to dream

All the mistakes 
That I've made in the lane
And the escape in the fence
And my family shamed on me
For thinking that way

I'm just like them
But I'm ok

Would you love me anyway?
Would you love me anyway?
