THE CHANT OF MIGHTY OFFSPRING

By saros vulcanic I am led
Towards all perfection of darkness
To the heights of hell...
...and the depths of heaven
I am the mightiest offspring
In slavery I was bred
Brought up by the sword
And mothered by the dead
And thus I danced
For the hate and love bound within my soul
With epithemus and the sphinx
Prometheus and the lynx
Lo, grant me thy namesake
Slayer of the pantheonic
"here I am!" blessed of the left hand
Guardian of the secrets of the forest
Grant me shining eyes and silent ways

...I have come for asherah!
