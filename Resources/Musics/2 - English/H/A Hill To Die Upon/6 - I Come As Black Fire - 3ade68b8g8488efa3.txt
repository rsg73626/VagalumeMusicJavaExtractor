I COME AS BLACK FIRE

"we become what we behold. we shape our tools and then our tools shape us." - marshall mcluhan

Remember me not
The one the eons forgot
My sons shall inherit my blasphemy
Remember me not
Leave my ashes to rot
For nothing good comes from babylon

Deliver me into the hand of the evil one
For I have been marked by the nazareths son

Burn black flame and I shall do the same
Tribuo ut caesar quis est caesari
Burn great light
Blind by the fallen might
We are the black void between the stars

I shall behold the black flame of ain
I shall behod the desert god the same
