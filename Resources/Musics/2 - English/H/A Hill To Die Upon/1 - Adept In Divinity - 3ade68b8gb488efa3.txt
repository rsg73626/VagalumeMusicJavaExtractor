ADEPT IN DIVINITY

"...We infer, that perchance he who is to come
Shall be called Titan." - Irenaeus, Against Heresies

From the top of my tower
I saw the sign descending
The birth of V.I.T.R.I.O.L.
The death of Yetzer-Ra
By the hand of the Moon
And touch of tyrant Sun
The Watcher of Styx
I have left behind.

Towards Castors portal
The gate of the Apzu
Brought by Gabriel
In search of leonine
Io, Astromortal!
The adept in divinity
Sought by Raphael
In conquest of the western sea

Angdae dürelen
Agarwaen Er
I am the left handed
Wizard of the War God
Angdae dürelen
Agarwaen Er
"No fate is shared,
No fate is shared!"
