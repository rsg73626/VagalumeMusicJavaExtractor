LET THE RAVENS HAVE MY EYES

"Jesus answered, my kingdom
Is not of this world: If my kingdom
Were of this world, then would my servants
Flight, that I should not be delivered
To the jews: But now is my kingdom not from hence. "
[- Kata I? annhn 18: 36]

I gave and I gave to lay
The stones for the churches of man
No longer do I labor in vain
And nor do I say: "... "

Forest is cut into timber, sea stopped up by dams
Look to the grain and current not sculpted by hands
Break the shrines and temples
Loose what the body holds
That which sadly is sold
For less than its weight in gold
Blindly I search for God
For in seeing I stumble
He is my troy, my maud
If I be so humble

Halel jah
Ich halel ha-satan
Dim the sun
Come, now, and make us one
Halel jah
Ich halel ha-satan
Pray for rain
Come, gives us bread and stay the same

Do you see, you see?
There was God on a tree
Huginn and musinn take my eyes
But I saw what I know is right
Take the third of my eyes
Lest it cause me to sin
Make me like that God
To stand the western wind

"Wenn sie den falschen
Zug einsteigen ist es kein gebrauch
Laufen den gang entlang
In die andrere richtung. "
