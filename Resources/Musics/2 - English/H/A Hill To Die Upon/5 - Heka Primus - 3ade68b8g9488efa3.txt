HEKA PRIMUS

"oh, that you would rend the heavens and come
Down, that the mountains would tremble before you!"
- isaiah 64:1

Lo!

Whilst thou breathe the fire of the gods?
The bitter flame, black as the dragons heart
Ana-elemental, the test of all thats pure
Adra-immortality, so far beyond the rest

Aurora
Helios divinitas
Of all silence
Scala perfectionis
Gog and magog
Deep elysium
War god
Norma mysterium
The winds shall flow undeterred
Aided with breathe and immortal seed
To the four corners of this voidless earth
I shall witness to this new mystery

Reveal to me the secrets of the sun!
