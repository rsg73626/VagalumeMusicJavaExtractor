NEKYIA

"But when with vows and prayers
I had made supplication to the tribes of the dead
I took the sheep and cut their throats
Over the pit, and the dark blood ran forth
Then there gathered from
Out of erebus the spirits of those that are dead... "
[- Homer, the odyssey]

Pray for rain to wash away
The blood and grease of war
Commit to train the children
To slaughter the children of our mothers and fathers

The wheel spun wide
Geometry lost its true
The falcon has lost its gloved hand
Sinking the heavy ship of all we knew
The center hasn't fallen away
We have cast if off
Where all the blood
Was spilt to call the ghosts

The buried us in the wounded ground
Under grass our decay made far too green
Nekyia
We dug a trench in the rhineland
Long as wind, payment for sin
The black ram was brought before the lord
Of the lower third of afterworld

Slouching towards bethlehem to be born
The new birth beats on the walls of the womb of the
World. Crawling fourth on four, the earth is torn
By claws, and two thousand year old horns
Nekyia

We dug a trench in the rhineland
Long as wind, payment for sin
The black ram was brought before the lord
Of the lower third of afterworld
But instead of its blood being shed
Our youth was released into the pit
The victor laid us down in our beds

Thus it was spoke, and thus it was writ
Even the idea of a center
Is left outside to rust
The sun is falling to dusk
On the gyre of the western world
The wheel spun wide
