SATAN SPEAKS

I am nature, the mighty mother
I am the law: Ye have none other
I am the flower and the dewdrop fresh
I am the lust in your itching flesh
I am the battle's filth and strain
I am the widow's empty pain
I am the sea to smother your breath
I am the bomb, the falling death

I am the fact and the crushing reason
To thwart your fantasy's new-born treason
I am the spider making her net
I am the beast with jaws blood-wet

I am a wolf that follows the sun
And I will catch him ere day be done
I am satan, accuser accursed
Heed not my words, I was not first
