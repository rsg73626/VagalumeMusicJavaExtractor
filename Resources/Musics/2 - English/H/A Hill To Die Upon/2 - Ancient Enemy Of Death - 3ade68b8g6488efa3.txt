ANCIENT ENEMY OF DEATH

"...the earth was formless and void, darkness was over the surface of the deep..." - genesis 1:2

The dance of the spheres disturbs my song
And the rhythm of the waves beats with the drums
In my wakefullness I see the myth come to life
And from the vantage of my spire I come

With horns I went to the edge of the world
And with wings I shall return
For in the shadow and smoke I was veiled
And of the blinding light I am born again

Deep within the gathering of the seas
The snake watches with lidless eyes
The titan waits for the woman
The woman waits for the beast

During that hour I saw the lifting of a sleep
For I saw nehushtan rise from his keep
And though darkness still lay upon the deep
I heard the voices of men give up and weep
