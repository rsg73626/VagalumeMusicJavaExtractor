MAY THE THING BE DESTROYED

"for when the mental faculty is joined
To evil will and power of execution,
Mankind has no defense to offer them."
- dante alighieri, inferno from canto 31

Dethroned shall I be;
With one spell erased
By my will, I will be undone
By thy will, I am no more
Now I descend upon this world
Blessed with the silence of all creation
Vocatvsatquenon
Vocatvsdeusaderit

Within spirit and favor
A spell upon my lips
'may the thing be destroyed!'
I reign in an ancient land
Of grace, desert, and war
With the blood of the watchers
And the line of the holy ones

Shed blood! my sons, shed blood!
