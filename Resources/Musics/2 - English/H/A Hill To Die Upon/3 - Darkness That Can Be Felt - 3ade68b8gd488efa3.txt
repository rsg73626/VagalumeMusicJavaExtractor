DARKNESS THAT CAN BE FELT

"it cannot be seen, cannot be felt, cannot be heard, cannot be smelt, it lies behind stars and under hills,, and empty holes it fills. it comes first and follows after, ends life, kills laughter."
- j.r.r. tolkien, the hobbit

Blinded may I be
But more senses waken
Of thou would call lies
I deem all else forsaken.
Hated may I be
But love shall then abound
For what is my blood then
Spilt upon the ground.

At last!
My place is gained among the manforsaken
At last!
My kind shall find our way back to the wilderness

O, thou hast the right!
To annoint my head with vermillion
Mark of the joyful slave
For I have the right
Hight atop the mountain,
Where the world prince was slain
I see the lone god
Holding the hexagram
I am the black space between the stars
I am the darkness that can be felt.

"and the lord said unto moses, stretch out thine
Hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness
Over the land of egypt, even the darkness which may
Be felt." - exodus 10:21
