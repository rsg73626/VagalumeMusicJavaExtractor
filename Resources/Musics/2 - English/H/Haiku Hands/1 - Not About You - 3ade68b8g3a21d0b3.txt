NOT ABOUT YOU

I feel like I'm on one
Banging on to someone
Before it comes undone
I'm gonna eat my cake

I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna

I'm going to tear up the lexicon
with a hexagon and my sexy thong on
No matter where your head is gone
or where you're from I'ma take you on

It's not about you

I'ma shake it like I'm Esteban on an auto barn
with a cordless arm and
I'll see you at the afterparty with a pink bugatti
and an evil scar band

It's not about you

All talk, hold court, oh lord I understood
No more brick wall
I'm brash and fuckin' good

It's not about you
Shut up
It's not about me either
I am my sisters keeper
Chill
It's not about you
Shut up
It's not about me either
It's us verse the grim reaper
Chill, Chill, Chill, Chill

You look like a tortoise
Your issues are enormous
In my eyes your flawless
I'm gonna share my cake

I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna

Turn the radio on
Drop a long kong song
When the lights come on we slay the beast and we eat

It's not about you

I'ma kick your arse
I'm kick your arse
I'm kick your arse
If you don't drop the facade

I said I'll hit the mark on the head
I said I'll bring you back from the dead
I did all that while you were in bed
And still had time to set the next trend

It's not about you
Shut up
It's not about me either
I am my sisters keeper
Chill
It's not about you
Shut up
It's not about me either
It's us verse the grim reaper
Chill, Chill, Chill, Chill

(We make your world bang)

(What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?)

What's happening Mang
We make your world bang
Too much of a good thang
It's time to drop

You gonna take it off
We gonna make it pop
We're making shapes and leaving circles in the crop

It's not about you
Shut up
It's not about me either
I am my sisters keeper
Chill
It's not about you
Shut up
It's not about me either
It's us verse the grim reaper
Chill, Chill, Chill, Chill

Shut up

It's not about
It's not about
Shut up

It's not about
It's not about
It's not about you
