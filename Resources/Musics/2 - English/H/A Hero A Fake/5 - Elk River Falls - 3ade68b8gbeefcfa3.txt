ELK RIVER FALLS

You protect me from this empty cell, from the bottom of my heart when you’re expecting more. slipping through my head are these vivid thoughts, the bottom of my heart, when you’re expecting more.

I said i missed your calls, i said i never lied.
That all fell apart when i stared into your eyes.

Like a fucking rock i fell, landing hard on flint, the inevitable spark to start it all.
The spark that led to, led to our downfall, sudden ignition, an explosive combustion.
Let the fire that burned within, reek it’s havoc on the world.
With fuel that you would provide…

All beauty burned black.

I can’t loose this.
You protect me from this empty cell, from the bottom of my heart when you’re expecting more. slipping through my head are these vivid thoughts, the bottom of my heart, when you’re expecting more.

The temperature was rising, my blood was boiling, the sun was setting on my heart.
Like a fucking rock i fell, landing hard on flint, the inevitable spark to start it all.
The spark that led to, led to our downfall, sudden ignition, an explosive combustion.
Let the fire that burned within, reek it’s havoc on the world.
With fuel that you would provide…

The earth is round but i’m standing at the edge.
I can’t change what was said.
I can’t change what was said.
I cannot change things in the past.

I can’t loose this.
You protect me from this empty cell, from the bottom of my heart when you’re expecting more. slipping through my head are these vivid thoughts, the bottom of my heart, when you’re expecting more.
