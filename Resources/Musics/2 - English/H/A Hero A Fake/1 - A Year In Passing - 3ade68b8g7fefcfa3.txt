A YEAR IN PASSING

Every passing wave brings a new people and like clock work the promise fell from this fragile crest, comes crashing down. I feel I’m drowning. Displacing all the feeble parts to this story.

Pounding at the edge of contemplation.
At this level it’s never to be determined.
Tortured by your gift.
I am a star, a star with out planets.
All I radiate is…
Pounding at the edge of contemplation.
At this level it’s never to be determined.
Tortured by your gift.
I am a star, a star with out planets.
All I radiate is lost.

I am lost in these parts.
I am lost in the stars.
I am lost in this heart.
I am lost in the waves.

The curve of the horizon lets me clearly see a temporal account of the last five years and how they compress down to a single moment. Like tentacles your roots reached out to latch on to the first thing to come by.

Grabbing at the first thing to come drifting by your little rock.
Entangled in debris, swept away from your dream.

Passing the time as a vessel, washed up on the shore.
She’ll walk away, she’ll walk away.
Swept back by the retreating tide, she’ll walk away from the sea.

Swept out with nothing on which to cling.

At it’s core, this world is uncertain.
Probability is fundamentally a constant the world fears.
Probability is fundamentally a constant the world has come to fear, the world has come to fear.
At it’s core.

Every passing wave brings a new people and like clock work the promise fell from this fragile crest, comes crashing down. I feel I’m drowning. Displacing all the feeble parts to this story.
