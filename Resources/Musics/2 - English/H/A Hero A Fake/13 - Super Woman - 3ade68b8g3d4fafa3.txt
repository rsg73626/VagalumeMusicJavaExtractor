SUPER WOMAN

Fuck everyone who cannot see just how amazing you are

Super hero

So impressive are your powers
Of toleration and persistence
These are the things that kept me around for so long

Stung by your fatal lips has wounded me
Save me from this poisoned city

And everyday I'm still amazed

By your stunning, beauty
Carnal attraction

Save me from this dying town and save me.

Please save me

Take care
Of us all
Provide safe ground

All I've done is bring pain into this world.
Your life was worse of me.

She can fly
Fly
She can not fly.

Stung by your fatal lips has wounded me
Save me from this poisoned city

Looking up at life
Wondering how I got here
I can't remember a thing
But who cares
When it feels this right
But who cares when it feels this right
