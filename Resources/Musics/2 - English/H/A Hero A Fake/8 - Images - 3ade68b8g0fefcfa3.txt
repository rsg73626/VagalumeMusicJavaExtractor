IMAGES

Please don’t leave me dying here, let me run my fingers through your hair and tell you i love you just one last time, one last time.
Please don’t leave me in despair, these wall are closing, i’m left with no air, the scent of your skin was the last breath i bare.
And i know that i am gone, left you there with open arms, as you’re waiting for me to come back home.
There is so much i can take leaving regrets, the hearts palpitate, as you’re waiting for me to come back home, to come back home.

Please don’t leave me dying here, let me run my fingers through your hair and tell you i love you just one last time, one last time.
Please don’t leave me in despair, these wall are closing, i’m left with no air, the scent of your skin was the last breath i bare.
Staring at this empty glass reflects images of the past, tell me that you’ll wait patiently, it’s all i ask.

Crushing identities killing my dreams, wings are wilted from this disease.
The air i need is part of your voice to keep me afloat to make this noise.
Crushing identities killing my dreams, guide me through the darkest of seas.
The past was lurking but you made it stop.

Please don’t leave me dying here, let me run my fingers through your hair and tell you i love you just one last time, just one last time.
Staring at this empty glass reflects images of the past, tell me that you’ll wait patiently.
This is for you and this if or me.
This is for the both of us, for eternity.
