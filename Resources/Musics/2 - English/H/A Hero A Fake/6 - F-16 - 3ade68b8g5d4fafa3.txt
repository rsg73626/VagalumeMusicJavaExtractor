F-16

Is this what you expected
The day that you enlisted
To kill

And he's not afraid to blow you away

Flying, soaring, bombing
Bringing death to those innocent

Crash burn

My dad's an F16 pilot

Crash burn

Is this the price that the invaded must pay for our liberation
A fee of blood

Flying soaring bombing
Bringing death to those innocent

You take them
You force them to fight
What happens to the family

You take them you force them to fight
