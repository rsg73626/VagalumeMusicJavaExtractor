LET OCEANS LIE

Everyday I’ve wasted,
I’ve let life pass me by.
Without an anchor, an anchor,
I’m standing helpless while I’m swallowed by the tide.

As I survey the sea,
Look out upon the cresting swells,
I count the waves, I count my dreams,
My dreams, my dreams, my dreams are fading.

I can’t make these torrents stop,
They’re crushing everything,
Weight of the water baring down,
Eroding my city, everything I worked so hard,
So hard to build.
The floods begun, I can’t make it stop.
The floods begun, I can’t make it stop.

I’ll pull myself up from disaster, greeted by a clear blue sky.
I find this city cleansed, I find myself again.
The sea is swelling and I feel the rising tides.

This city sinks to hell.
This city sinks to hell, and I can feel it crumbling.

I won’t be buried a live, this is no mans land but my own.
I’ll pull myself up from disaster.

I’ll pull myself up from disaster, greeted by a clear blue sky.
I’ll find this city, find this city cleansed.
I’ll find myself, find myself again.
I’ll pull myself up from disaster, greeted by a clear blue sky.
I find this city cleansed, I find myself again.
The sea is swelling and I feel the rising tides.

This city sinks to hell.
This city sinks to hell.
