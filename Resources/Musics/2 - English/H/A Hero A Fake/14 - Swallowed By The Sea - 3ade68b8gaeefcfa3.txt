SWALLOWED BY THE SEA

I watched them fade, as waves often do.
They were swallowed by the sea, waves swallowed by the sea.
I watched the lights over the horizon, blocked by the clouds, the lights fell away.

I’m standing right here and I’m gonna keep on screaming. Repeating everyday until you hear the sounds in my head.

Oh god I’m sinking, I’m stuck in the sand.

I’m standing right here and I’m gonna keep on screaming. Repeating everyday until you hear the sounds in my head.

Oh god I’m sinking.

Laying gently between the warm sand, only for a moment, until my breath runs out. The chase after you was worth the struggle that I could imagine.

I’m standing right here and I’m gonna keep on screaming. Repeating everyday until you hear the sounds in my head.

Oh god I’m sinking.

Oh god I’m sinking I’m stuck in the sand.
Only for a moment until my breath runs out.
My sun fades, the lights are getting dim, my sun fades out.
