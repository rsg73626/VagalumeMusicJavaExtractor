ASTRONOMICAL

The miracles of everyday, they blind us all.
We’re numb to them.
I’ve witnessed the power of the moon.
I’ve witnessed the rising of the sea.
The faces of the beautiful, the minds of the innocent.

The earth is a stage engulfed in chaos.

Life sparks, overcoming the variables, against all odds, life goes on.

I’ve been searching for a miracle, hoping air would turn to gold.
Scanning my existence, searching for a miracle.

I’ve been hoping air would turn to gold.

I’ve been searching for a miracle, hoping air would turn to gold. Scanning my existence, hoping air would turn to gold. Events with astronomical odds of occurrence. Show me a miracle. I’ve been searching for a miracle, hoping air would turn to gold. Scanning my existence, hoping air would turn to gold. Events with astronomical odds of occurrence. These are miracles.

Life sparks, overcoming the variables, against all odds, life goes on.

I found mine in the most unlikely of places.
A city I despise.

This time I’m not letting go of you.
This time I’m not letting go of you.

The miracles of everyday, they blind us all.
We’re numb to them.
I’ve witnessed the power of the moon.
I’ve witnessed the rising of the sea.
The faces of the beautiful

Compared to you they are nothing
Compared to you they are nothing
You are the air turned to gold
You are the air turned to gold
