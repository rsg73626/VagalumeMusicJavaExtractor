JUST ANOTHER NUMBER

I can't hold on, knowing that this life has taken a wrong turn.
This burn inside, this burn is taking over.
I ask myself is this feeling natural.
Are these feelings inside, taking over now.
Just remember, I was your first.
I was your first, you were my love.
You expect me to lie.
What we had was full of worth.
You expect me to lie.
But what did it mean.
And I can't hold on.
I hope you cry at night.
Now I see that you're not well.
Your skin shows the story of your unveiling life.
To forgive is to forget, but neither will I do.
This pain can never be erased, only buried.
So take your disease, rot away.
Because what once was a soulâ€¦
You're just another number.
I can't hold on knowing that this life's taken a wrong turn.
This burn inside, this burn is taking over.
I ask myself is this feeling natural
