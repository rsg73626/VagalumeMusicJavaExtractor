IMPART YOUR LOSS

Back again for round two, we’re still not done, we’ve just begun.
What you hear is not a lie, it’s the truth, it’s the truth.
You’ll regret what was said, by the end of this song.

Bright minds come forth, not blinded by the shit, of all that’s meaningless, but who’s to blame.

Called to arms.
Gather your troops.
Be sure to strike with intent.
It would be a shame to only make a dent.
Called to arms.
Gather your troops.

We’ve asked for just one more chance, but you’re backed up to the edge, you’re backed up to the edge. Open your eyes and do not fear, intensions are pure and words are clear. I’m afraid to let this go, I’m afraid to let this go.

When I’m broken and I’m gone.
When I’m broken and I’m gone.
When it’s all said and done I’ll still be my gathers son.

All we ask for is just one more chance to make everything clear.
Open your eyes our dreams are clear.
You’ll regret what was said by the end of this song.
