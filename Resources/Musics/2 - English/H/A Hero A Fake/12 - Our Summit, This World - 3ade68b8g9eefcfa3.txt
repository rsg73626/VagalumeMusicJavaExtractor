OUR SUMMIT, THIS WORLD

Distorted dreams and my lies, and my lies and my lies.
Distorted dreams and my lies, and my lies and my lies.

I let myself go.

I let myself go and I found you.
Cut all the tethers that bind me to this world.

That bind me.

I found you on top of the world.
Our meeting shining through.

The storm that was to ensue, the wind that blew, our love that grew.

My perception, so far from the truth.
My narrow view, it hurt you too.

It is I who sold us out and it is I who owes my life.
It is I who sold us out and it is I who owes my life.

Distorted dreams and my lies, and my lies and my lies.
Distorted dreams and my lies, and my lies and my lies.

I found you on top of the world.
Our meeting shining through.

I needed you.
I need you.
Come back home.
Come back home.
