DEAR

Come on man, we’ve all known.
We’ve all known for over a year.
We’ve all known, we’ve all known, what was coming, what was coming, what was here.

All these lies this is weird, I’ve been here as long as you.

You let us down.
You had to always lie.

I hope you can see that it’s not just me.
Everyone knows how much you had to take on.

This is the time where we have to come clean.
There’s no more being friend, if your just going to run around creating heart aches where they don’t belong.

Is this really happening.
Can you give up, on your life, on your dreams?
Just let’em go.

I do believe I’ve let my life lead me the right way. Following my dreams and following my friends I can create a life full of love, full of my own happiness. It’s not for me to do alone, I have my friends, but I wont sacrifice this all, not for just one girl.

So if you and me disagree, I’ll be the one smiling.
And I’ll look back, I’ll look back and think of how you must be at home crying, wishing you had not given up. You’re going to miss out on life.
I hope it was all worth it.

If this is all you can give, you are a failure.

This is the time, time where we have to come clean.
This is the time, time where we have to come clean.
