I KNOW I

Hey honey
I know I've lied, but I'd like to make it up.

I know this sort of thing is not easily explained but girl give me a chance. Don't you see I've been stuck in my head.

It's never been so clear exactly what you do to me. You make me insane you drive me crazy. And I'll slip back into my head and in this place I've lost myself.

Stuck trapped imprisoned in a nueronic cage.

There's no way out from here.
There's no way to escape.

It's never been so clear exactly what you do to me. You make me insane you drive me crazy. And I'll slip back into my head and in this place I've lost myself.

There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
Be mine, set me free.

The intensity of my love will overflow my veins, spill onto the floor. Maybe then you'll see what is internalized inside of me.

All love, all hate, all the world for you.

And I'll slip back into my head and in this place I've lost myself. It's never been so clear exactly what you do to me. You make me insane you drive me crazy
