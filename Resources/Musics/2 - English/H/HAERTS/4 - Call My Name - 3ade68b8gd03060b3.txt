CALL MY NAME

When you know it's time a day to be free
When you heard too much at loving me
That's when you leave me
Leave me lone
When you clear to me, but you not really there
When I close my afraid of your stare
That's when I'm leaving
Leaving you lone!

I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain

When the past is gone & the future untold
Knowing all I dies and wondering so
That's when you dreaming
Dreaming to lone

I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain

Make me dreaming
Make me not feeling
There's a silence? rock you in
Then my demon start in your hands tonight!

I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain

I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
I don't know I ever Call My Name
When I'll leave, I'll take away the pain
That's when you leave me
Leave me lone!
