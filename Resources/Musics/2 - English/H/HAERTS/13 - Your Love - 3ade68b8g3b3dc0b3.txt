YOUR LOVE

Running like a fire
Burning in the wind
You say you'll take me higher
Higher than I've been
It was a feeling
I never wanna live in

But it couldn't turn into you awake
Holding on you anyway
I'm trying stop the heartache
Trying to stay awake
It was a feeling (feeling)
I never wanna live in (live in)

I don't want your love
If you can breathe without it
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna be the one
No, I won't be the one
If you don't want me to

I don't know the way
The way that you feel about me
I don't wanna stay
If you can be free without me
Don't wanna give it up
Don't wanna give it up
If you can give it back

I never was a dreamer
Never wanted to pretend
When the night comes to feel you
And the dreams you never end
And I want you to be with me
And I want you to be free
And I want you to remember
That I don't want you to fall for

I don't want your love
If you can breathe without it
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna be the one
No, I won't be the one
Don't want you to go
(I don't know, I don't know no)
If you keep fighting
(I don't know, I don't know no)
Just can't give it up just trying

I don't want your love
If you can breathe without it
I don't want your love
If you don't dream about it
Don't wanna give it up
Don't wanna give it up
Don't wanna give it up
If you can give it up

I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)
If you can breath without it
I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)
If you dont dream about it
Don't wanna give it up
(don't wanna give it up)
Don't wanna give it up
If you can give it back
I don't know, I don't know no
It's falling down
I don't know, I don't know no
It's falling down
I don't know, I don't know no
It's falling down
I don't know, I don't know
