BE THE ONE

It's going on for a while, what you're feeling
You say you're leaving what you can't believe in
Don't you say you're alone, I will fight it
Are you happy inside, but you're smiling
You say you never knew what you needed
You say it's hardest to find when you're bleeding
You know you never look down when I pass by
I never meant to control, never asked why

(You wanted to be)
Be the one I want to make with
Be the one I want to take with
Be the one I want to break with
(You wanted to be)
Be the one that I would lie for
Be the one that I would die for
Be the one that I would touch
Be the one I love too much
Be the one
Be the one

No one knows where you go when you're leaving
Try to close my eyes, to start dreaming
Don't know why you don't know what to tell me
Don't know why you're trying to sell me

(You wanted to be)
Be the one I want to make with
Be the one that I would take with
Be the one that I would break with
(You wanted to be)
Be the one that I would lie for
Be the one that I would die for
Be the one that I would touch
The one that loves too much
Be the one
Be the one

Can you show it when we're going down
(Be the one)
(You wanted to be)
(You wanted to be)
Be the one who always will
Be the one who always will
Be the one who always will
