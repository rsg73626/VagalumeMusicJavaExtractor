WINGS

I will never let you go
I know you want it
I know you want it
Learning love means not to know
I'll learn to take it
Learn to take it Love

I will never leave your fears
I know you're lost now
Know you're lost now
Counting days won't buy us years
We'll star it over
Start it over, Love

I'll never let the magic go
I'll float away into your afterglow
I'll never let you go
I'll melt away into your afterglow

The sky will melt in tears
I'll floataway into your afterglow
The sky will melt in tears
I'll melt away into your afterglow

People never smile to say goodbye
Leaving means there's nothing left to try
But I broke my wings for you
I smiled as you untied our love for good

Love
