NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW

Everybody needs some time away
The words are lost when words don't try to say
I got a secret no one else could keep
Everybody needs some time away
The words are lost when words don't try to say
I got a secret no one else could keep
I'm never sure or trust it's just for me
And no one needs to know
no one needs to know
no one needs to know

Will you stay up all night
When I'm the only reason why, reason why
You say you want to know me now
But you never tried, never tried
And then out here we hear a little
Hear a little cry
You say you'll never speak about it
I'll take it till I die

Every time I walk these floors alone
Now you can find me through these walls of stone
I hold a heavy treasure in my chest
Until I let it go I won't confess
And no one needs to know
no one needs to know
no one needs to know

Will you stay up all night
When I'm the only reason why, reason why
You say you want to know me now
But you never tried, never tried
And then out here we hear a little
Hear a little cry
You say you'll never speak about it
I'll take it till I die

You never try to see me
You never ever, too hard
I didn't kiss one more last boy
I waited for us to guide
And no one needs to know
no one needs to know
no one needs to know!

Will you stay up all night
When I'm the only reason why, reason why
You say you want to know me now
But you never tried, never tried
And then out here we hear a little
Hear a little cry
You say you'll never speak about it
I'll take it till I die
