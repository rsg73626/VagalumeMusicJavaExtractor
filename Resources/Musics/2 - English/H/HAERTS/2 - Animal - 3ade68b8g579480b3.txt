ANIMAL

[Verse]
In the light, I see my shadow
I will never let your heart go
In the night, I fall each time you take
Another part of me until you break
In the night, I'll be your neckhole
Pull your heart until you follow
Never stop until I see you fall
Cause you know I'm just an animal

[Verse]
In the light, I see my shadow
I will never let your heart go
In the night, I fall each time you take
Another part of me until you break
In the night, I'll be your neckhole
Pull your heart until you follow
Never stop until I see you fall
Cause you know I'm just an animal

[Outro]
And you feel it when you fall and let go
(Hard to turn around when you're falling)
In the night, I'm just an animal
(Hard to hold your heart when you're falling)
And you feel it when you fall and let go
(Hard to turn around when you're falling)
In the night, I'm just an animal
