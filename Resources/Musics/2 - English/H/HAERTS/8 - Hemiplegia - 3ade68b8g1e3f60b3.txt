HEMIPLEGIA

Slow, slow, slow
Wade through water
Numbed the lightness
Words don't bother
I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving
Hemiplegia holds me tight

Gold, gold, gold
Burns our oceans
Forced I sold
My devotion

I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving
Hemiplegia holds me tight
No, you can't move up with your eyes down
No, you can't look up with your eyes down
No, you can't move up with your eyes down
No, you can't move up

I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving
Hemiplegia holds me tight
No, you can't move up with your eyes down
No, you can't look up
No, you can't move up with your eyes down
