HOPE

Love, is the air that fools breathe
Cause they hope that there's more than they see
Leave, there's no reason to stay
I will follow

And we search for the reasons
And pray for the gods
Day by day
Building our bridges on common grounds
We hope, for what's never been there
It's to loose the ragged shoes that we wear

Then we search for the reasons
And pray for the gods
Day by day
Building our bridges on common grounds
Now the crazy don't want to believe
What do I know? I'm just hoping slow

They will fall like all the others
That's just how life goes
Don't rush towards the finish line
You promised me
That we would hope

And we pray for the reasons
And search for the God
Day by day
Building our bridges on common grounds
Now the crazy don't want to believe
What do I know? I'm just hoping slow
Hoping slow
Hoping slow
