ALL THE DAYS

Time has come
And some gone
Memory faded

Lines are lost
Neon frost
On the sunset

Golden things
We drew our names
In the water

Now you're gone
A love gone wrong
But I'll make it

All the days we had together
All the days we had together

You can teach
A heart to reach
Out to another

Leaving me
Would leave me free
To reach above now?

All the days we had together
All the days we had together
All the days we had together
All the days we had together

Oh, and when the light is lost the night will follow
Our memory falls into the sun
And when the night is lost the light will follow
Our memory cannot take us back

All the days we had together
All the days we had together
All the days we had together
All the days we had together
