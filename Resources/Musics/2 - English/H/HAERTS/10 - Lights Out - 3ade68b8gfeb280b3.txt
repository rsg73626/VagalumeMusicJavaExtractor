LIGHTS OUT

There's something building up inside me
I know it's going to break out soon
I thought that if I kept it quiet
It might just pass on through
I fear I'm drifting out of the circle
Let's go and draw another one
My floors are scratched and so is my heart
And it's hard to move on. To move on

The people in the streets are screamin'
Their whispers never gonna be known
Don't waste your time thinking that all that you know
It's the time to move along
And no one has to say their sorry
Or try to get it right this time
On looking back our backs will be warm
But our hearts wil be fine

Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
It's too late. It's too late
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
It's too late

Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
It's too late. It's too late
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
Don't call me when the lights go out
It's too late. It's too late. It's too late
