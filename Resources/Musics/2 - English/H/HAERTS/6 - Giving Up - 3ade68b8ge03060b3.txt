GIVING UP

Now I'm a stranger in my own world
It's not your fault that can't use words
Your eyes are a force I can't fight
Never touching, they're as dark as night
Holding on

Now I'm a stranger, I know I'm gone
The highest love isn't always the best
Racing my heart breaks through my chest
An electric reaction in me
It's not a choice to dance dangerously
Sometimes, the highest love is too far to feel

I'm giving up
You say it's now or never
I'm giving up
In time it's for the better
I'm giving up
Before the night is gone!
I'm giving in
Giving up strong!

I'm giving up
You say it's now or never
I'm giving up
In time it's for the better
I'm giving up
These dreams into the sun!
I'm giving in
Giving up strong!

When there's nothing left to walk away
Chasing a feeling we can't tame
You know the darkness no one believes
I know there's no relief in these dreams
Whenever there's nothing left for us to feel

I'm giving up
You say it's now or never
I'm giving up
In time it's for the better
I'm giving up
Before the night is gone!
I'm giving in
Giving up strong!
I'm giving up

You say it's now or never
I'm giving up
In time it's for the better
I'm giving up
These dreams into the sun!
I'm giving in
Giving up strong!

In a time without memory
It's more than a fantasy
A time without memory
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'm giving
Go, don't try to hold it
Go, don't cry about it
Go, don't try to hold it
Go, don't cry about it

I'm giving up
You say it's now or never
I'm giving up
In time it's for the better
I'm giving up
Before the night is gone!
I'm giving in
Giving up strong!
I'm giving up

You say it's now or never
I'm giving up
In time it's for the better
I'm giving up
These dreams into the sun!
I'm giving in
Giving up strong!
Giving up, I'm giving up!
