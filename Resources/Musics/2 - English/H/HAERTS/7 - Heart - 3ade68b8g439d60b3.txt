HEART

I will never break your heart
Don't go blame it on me
Blame the silence, the voices, the fear
But just leave your heart be

There's a reason we search for the one
They will bond us to be free
They will take our roots down in the ground
So deep

I will never leave you dark
At sunrise I will be there
So we'll stamp bare foot on the ground (?)
Catching each other's tears

There's a reason we search for the one
They will bond us to be free
They will take our roots down in the ground
So deep

If we're ever gonna break apart
Don't you go, don't you break your heart
If we're ever gonna break apart
Don't you go, don't you break your heart

There's a reason we search for the one
They will bond us to be free
They will take our roots down in the ground
So deep

If we're ever gonna break apart
Don't you go, don't you break your heart
If we're ever gonna break apart
Don't you go, don't you break your heart
