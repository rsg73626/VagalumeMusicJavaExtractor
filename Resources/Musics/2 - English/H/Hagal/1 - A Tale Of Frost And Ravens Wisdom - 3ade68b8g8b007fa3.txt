A TALE OF FROST AND RAVENS WISDOM

Over the crown of whiteness
Eternal, cloudy eclipse, 
frequent separation from the sight
Grey seashore, handsome cold landscape
Misantrophic spirits at forgotten places
Snowcovered mountain ranges, frostbitten streams
Deeper into scenery, aesthetical of frozen winds
Unchanging structures from ancient mights
Black high seas, high surges, 
to mirror the same blackness
The kings of the ravens on their way, 
wisdom is kept from their tribe
Panels, snowcovered lakes, 
where the settlers of a dark nature seem to be forgotten
The ravens eye sparkles, on its wings it plunges down
Its thoroughbred phylum, the chosen one
Who sees and has the might to relate
Forest, the flute of the wind, it sounds loudly
Through endless valleys of frost
And joins the wolves howling
Like screams of haunted souls
Under endless glossy northern lights
Absorbing all, sharp-writted it is, 
the perspicacity helps to sense the truth
Upwards, swinging the wings
Through clear, frozen clouds
The wisdom will be nourished
From senses of its squad
Oath of allegiance has been spoken
So faithfulness for the throne
The ravens eye sparkles, on its wings it plunges down
Its thoroughbred phylum, the chosen one
Who sees and has the might to relate
Stated. Made out eternally
