I'M A PATHOLOGIST

I love my job
as many people do
because of my profession
my sickest dreams came true
They laughed at me
because I am an alcoholic
Now I hate mankind
I'm totally misanthropic

I am a worker of death
I'm a pathologist

I'll meet you when you are dead
My morgue awaits for you
I sniff some cocaine
I'm going to cut you in two
the bistoury in my hand
I'm ready to dissect
Alcohol inside my veins
The feast starts again

I am a worker of death
I'm a pathologist

Pathology is my life
My obsession until I die

I am a worker of death
I'm a pathologist
