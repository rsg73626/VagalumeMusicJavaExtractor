ANATOMIZED

Surgical dissection
On nameless remains
Weird tools cut asunder
Exposed insides

The nauseating stench
In the morgue
Is umbereable

Icecold cadavers
Spill their guts
On the table

Incised epigatrium
Ejecting curdled fluids
Extirpate the appendix
As gall-bladder erupts

Jisgaws amputate
Their rigids limbs
Drilling their wrists

Putrid anatomy
is clinically spoiled
by pathologists

Medical recipients
Full of bodily slags
Pieces of the corpses
Rest in plastic bags
