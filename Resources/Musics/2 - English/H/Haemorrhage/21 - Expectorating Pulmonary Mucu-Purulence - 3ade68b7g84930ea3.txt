EXPECTORATING PULMONARY MUCU-PURULENCE

Consumed cartilage, absorbed mucous membrane
Internal Haemorrhage flowing from your airways
Desperately you gasp - ripping vocal cords
A repulsive sound - crepitating snore
Cavernous stertot ... Agony concerto

Phlegms plug your larynx
expulsed as you cough
Severe bronchitis
A thick mass of mucus
Gargling in your throat
Bloody haemoptysis

Lungs collapsed
Frenzied gasp
Expectorating mucu-purulence...
Painful breath
Rythmic snort
Expectorating mucu-purulence...

Profuse vomica
Retched and disgorged
(Respiratory wound)
Dilated pneumothorax
Oppressing diaphragm
Slow suffocation

Viscous congestion - Pulmonary edema
Asthmatic asphyxiation - Rupturing emphisema

Lungs collapsed
frenzied gasp
expectorating mucu-purulence...
Painful breach
rythmic snort
Expectorating mucu-purulence...

Decomposition...
"Pathologist disconnect the scanner
... Patient is finally dead"
