PSYCHOTIC DELIRIUM

Ultraviolent psychopath -affective disorder
Misanthropic - "I'm dead to the world"
Forensic informs reveal necrophilic habits
Raped, devoured and humiliated and then left to rot

Scalpeled, and torn... Ritual mutilation
Altering my mind with the stench of putrefaction

Homcidal lunacy Schizophrenic carnage
"Slaughtering was only a part of my work...
Evil voices in my head induced me to hack them.
I devoured their foul remains as they decompose"

Scalpeled, and torn... Ritual mutilation
Altering my mind with the stench of putrefaction

The stench of rot

Nauseating visions of that dark autopsy room
Where the rotten bodies were dismemebered and consumed
Smel the odour... on the cold remains I rave
Hallucinations... see the corpse rising from their graves

...Psychotic delirium
...It's haunting again

narcoleptic consciousness sickness dementia
Medication overdose blurs my brain
The pathethic reality of the insane asylum
I can smell that foul stench-nightmare starts again

Scalpeled, and torn... Ritual mutilation
Disturbing my mind with the stench of putrefaction

The stench of rot..
