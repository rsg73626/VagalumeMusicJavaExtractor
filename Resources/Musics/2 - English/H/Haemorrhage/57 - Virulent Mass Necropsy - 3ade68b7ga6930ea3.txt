VIRULENT MASS NECROPSY

Staring at the corpses, narcotic gasses rise
Disturbing my conscience with visions I despise

Mesmerized by the stench of rot
Sickly torn with medical scorn

I rave as I dismember my bloodstained axe strikes
Enslavement to sickness ... my loathe boils deep inside

Mesmerized by the stench of rot
Sickly torn with medical scorn

Forensic Holocaust
Virulent Mass Necropsy

Multifarious autopsy - Overcrowded morgue
Bodies in putrefaction drowned in gore
Errors of pathology - Collective disgust
Tattered carnal leftovers crushed to dust

The visceral pandemonium where minced organs fly
Atrocious dissection, vast piles of flesh I slice

Mesmerized by the stench of rot
Sickly torn with medical scorn

Forensic Holocaust
Virulent Mass Necropsy
