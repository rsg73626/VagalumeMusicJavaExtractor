EXHUMING IMPULSE

In the night I returned to the graveyard
I just wanted to make sure he was dead
Prosecuted by neurotic obsessions
Find an answer far beyond the cemetery gates

Looking for a recent tomb ... exhuming after midnight
I remove the dead remains from their graves
A nauseating lapse of wrath ... crippling without reason
Tear apart the rotting flesh ... I go insane

After hours of exhaustive exhumations
Sniffing necrotic fumes ... I went mad
Lysergide putrilage emanation
High on Pestilent Narcosis ... I lost my head

Looking for a recent tomb ... exhuming after midnight
I remove the dead remains from their graves
A nauseating lapse of wrath ... crippling without reason
Tear apart the rotting flesh ... I go insane

Fermented Entrails ... Corrupted Organs
Remnants Begin To necrose
Splattered Guts ... Dismembered Torsos
Slaughtered bodies ... Decompose

Keep on rotting ... Keep on rotting in your grave
Sick attraction ... Sick attraction to the dead

Pieces of the mangled stiffs ... thrown out of their coffins
Pulverised human slag ... pestilent decay
Cloven Cadaveric waste ... Frenzied mutilation
Eager impulse to devour my disinterred preys

Looking for a recent tomb ... exhuming after midnight
I remove the dead remains from their graves
A nauseating lapse of wrath ... crippling without reason
Tear apart the rotting flesh ... He's not there

Fermented Entrails ... Corrupted Organs
Remnants Begin To necrose
Splattered Guts ... Dismembered Torsos
Slaughtered bodies ... Decompose

Let me vomit ... Let me vomit on your grave
Sick attraction ... Sick attraction to the dead
