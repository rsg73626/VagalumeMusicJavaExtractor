TORRENT LIKE EVENTERATION

Acute peritonitis in acrid purulence
Volatile gases expand as tissues efferscence
Bile-encrusted innards rupture and prolapse
Congested by flatulence...

Pneumo-gastric collapse
Expulsive disembowelment
Cascade of guts and gore
Peritoneum bursts open... Abdominal disgorge!!!

Stomach explodes ejecting blood and chyme
Gushing gastric juices gurgling faecal slime
Raging eventeration visceral mass comesforth
Extruded entrails splat upon the floor.
