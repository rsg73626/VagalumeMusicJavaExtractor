FAR BEYOND THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGY

For many years I worked in the morgue
Human body has no secrets
I'm the explorer of the rotting flesh
And perversions without limits
Far beyond!!!!!!!
Pathology!!!!!!
Fanatic expert on anatomy
My dissecting are the sickest
An artistic way of necrology
Mutilation and defilement
Inserting the trachea in the anal tract
Symmetric escissions cut you in a half
Forced to deformity, members I hack
Excavate the craneal crypt to entomb the heart
Quartering my last grotesque masterpiece
Then I suture it with love
The macabre god of mortuary art
Now, my creation is blessed in rot
Far beyond!!!!!!! Pathology!!!!!!
