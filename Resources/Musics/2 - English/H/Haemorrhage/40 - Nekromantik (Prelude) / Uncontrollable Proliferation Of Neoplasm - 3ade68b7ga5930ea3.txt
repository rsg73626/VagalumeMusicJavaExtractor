NEKROMANTIK (PRELUDE) / UNCONTROLLABLE PROLIFERATION OF NEOPLASM

Propagating, multiplying, tumours grow
Into pustulous cavities neoplasm breeds
Propagating, multiplying, tumours grow
Ulcerating, multiplying, tumours grow

Ulcerating, necrotising, making sores
Into pustulous cavities neoplasm breeds
Thru your lymphatic ways fastly it spreads
Your body is infested of tumefaction

Decaying by a malignant carcinosis
Re-generated after each extirpation
In a cancerous metastasis
Mortified proliferationd will never cease
