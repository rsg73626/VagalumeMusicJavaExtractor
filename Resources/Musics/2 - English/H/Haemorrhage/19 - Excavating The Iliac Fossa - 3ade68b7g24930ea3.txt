EXCAVATING THE ILIAC FOSSA

Slicing deep into your excoriated abdomen
Slooping out guts when peritoneum is clouen

Your septic iliac fossa I excavate
Morbid organs I want to extirpate

Violently I gouge into the wrigging visceral mass
Dissing up kidneys urine bladder I slash

Your septic iliac fossa I excavate
Morbid organs I want to extirpate

Corroded by urea macerated in pus
Severed stomach spurting gastric juices
This pungent aroma doesn't cause me disgust
Stale chyme and chyme disappear in the sluice

Your septic iliac fossa I excavate
Morbid organs I want to extirpate

Removed liver genitals are emasculated
Avulsed in pain your inner core is obliterated
