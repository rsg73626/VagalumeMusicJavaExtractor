DYING ON A MASS OF CHYME AND RANCID EXCREMENT

Down in the Carnal Abbyss...
Dying in this putrid place
Pale dissected bodies rot...
Minced, disemboweled
and partially defleshed

Dying on a mass of chyme
Floating on a mass of rancid excrement
Fear of the pathologists
In the Putritorium they will never find me

I'm still alive...
But rot is infecting my tissues...
crawling through melting innards...
on faecal sludge
My Body is covering by festers and pus

Dying on a mass of chyme
Floating on a mass of rancid excrement
Blinded by the Ammonium mist
The putrid effluvium...I can't resist

The carnal abyss...

The secretions of the dead are dripping
and my skin is turning grey
Loathing desperation...I'm going to escape
Get out of this pile of rotting entrails

Dying on a mass of chyme
Floating on a mass of rancid excrement
Decompositive abbyss
