PUTRESCENT NECROMORPHISM

The purulent epitaph sulpted in neoplasm
Sores of the cadaver carved without qualm
Multicystic innards suppurate
Putrefaction makes your stinky fate

Premature facial necrosis
Mortified scarfskin
Carneous tumoral excrescence
Putrescent necromorphism!!!!!!!!!

The tongue disapears
In a corrosive secretion
Brain fermentation juice
Cause the eyes obliteration
Vomit your last fluids
In a post-mortem effort
But trachea is choked
With pulped cancerous guts

Decomposing emantions
A cold bile foaming stream
Extensive ulcers and chancres
Putrescent necromorphism!!!!!!!!!

The necrotrophic cycle has begun
For this flesh pale and numb
Paradise of paradites maggots'joy
The carrion formations will be destroyed.
