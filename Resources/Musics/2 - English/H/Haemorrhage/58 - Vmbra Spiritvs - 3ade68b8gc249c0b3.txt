VMBRA SPIRITVS

If you seek to drink from the challice
Of eternity
Surpass this material conception of reality11
The mistery of death define the truth
Where all patetic gods will be sentenced to doom

By the ways of the dark your must pass
To achieve this spellbound wisdom
The blackned path... the serpent infusion
To destroy the sephiroth's illusions

Umbra, umbra ispiritvs Lilithp
Umbra, umbra ispiritvs Samael
Umbra, umbra ispiritvs lvcifer

To conect and open the gates
Of the underwolrd
Spell this edge, my words and my filth blood
Under billions of stars are yours anti cosmic light
black sun magestic
Umbral rulers of the other side

I invoke
Hear me
Manifest
And obbey!
