DECOM-POSERS

Six feet down rot sets in
Putrefactive bacteria (Grows) under the marbled skin
Acid liqid liquids and enzimes are released
Self maceration by stale corpse fluids

Deteriorated corpse... by necrosis
Rebellious mass of grubs... Decom-poser!!!!
Swarming maggots-spoiling the dead
Hungry insects worm-eaten brain

Molten innards-fermented juices
Rancid carrion-munched into pulp
Sarco-blasters, larval plague
Maggots buzzing into the grave

Ashes to ashes, flesh to dust
Cadaver's turned into a pile of grubs!!!!
Deteriorated corpse... by necrosis
Rebellious mass of grubs... Decom-poser!!!!
