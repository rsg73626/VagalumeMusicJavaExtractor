DECREPIT DEJECTION

Dysenteric recrements retrained in your bowels
Disolving gastric mucose by fermenting rot
Collapsing colon dilating small intestine
Malodorous faecal mass corroded in sepsis

Decrepit dejection

Coprophagist bacteria munching rectal cysts
In painful tenesmus your entrails twist
Dislocated pilorus gases deflagrate
Your digestive system is violently
evecuated

Decrepit dejection
