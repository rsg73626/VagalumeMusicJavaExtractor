0 MORGUE SWEET HOME

Here again ... on my cold mortuary slab
In my Anatomy theatre for the final act
At the medical scaffold ... I commence
My last clinical Opus of Revenge

Kept alive for Dissection

Methods of surgical brutalism
Bizarre forensic instruments pierce your skin
Phrenetic amputations - fractured bones
Without qualm festered viscera I remove

Kept alive for Dissection

Disembowelment - I rub the intestines on your face
Shredded abdomen - profuse gastric haemorrhage
Mangled innards - dislocated anal tract
Nauseous Torment - Festered organs I extract

In the morgue ... lesson on gore
You shall bleed for pathology

Excruciating denervation of the lumbar spine
Genital laceration ... testicles I grind
Oxidized cranial auger drill your brain
Frantic mortal Convulsions ... die in pain

Kept alive for Dissection

Final movement - your heart beating in my hand
Live Necropsy - Morgue is not only for the dead
Mutilation - sliced arteries spurting blood
Furious Carnage - you are dismembered alive

In the morgue ... lesson on gore
You shall bleed for pathology
