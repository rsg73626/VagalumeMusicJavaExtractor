CADAVERIC METAMORPHOSE

Necrotic plasma in cellular decay
Rotting enzymes, autolysified remains
Fetid pyosis oozing thru the flesh
Brooding parasites, ebullition in the dead
Disintegrated, and decomposed
As maggot munch-metamorphosed
Voracious turmoil of starving grubs
Masticating innards, drinking all the pus
Devoured carcasses,
bones is all that left
Procreating larvs, spawn of death
