SLAVED TO DISMEMBER

I never will confess you the disgusting things I did
Obnoxious dissections postmortem carnal sins...
Sick forensic duties left some sequels in my mind
A sickening addiction... unquenchable urge to grind

Frenzied autopsies... heaps of gore
tearing out organs, skin and bones
to rip, deface and mutilate
Grotesque obsession... "I have to dismember them"

Putrescent atmosphere where I worked night and day
Inhaling the effluvium of the decomposed remains
Medical perversions, brutal surgery on the dead
The sight of the corpses unleash madness in my head

Frenzied autopsies... heaps of gore
tearing out organs, skin and bones
to rip, deface and mutilate
Grotesque obsession... "I have to dismember them"

You know I'm slaved to dismember
You know I'm slaved to dismember

Feverishly I hack
Your hook-pierced torso
Torn apart with hate

Grimly I excise the entrails
>From the stabbed abdomen
Severed remains...
Let me tear this corpse apart...

I mince up your limbs
With psychotic excitements
I gloat on the gore
Munching body fragments
-Solo-
You know I'm slaved to dismember
You know I'm slaved to dismember...
...to dismember!
