OBNOXIOUS (SURGEON OF THE DEAD)

I am obnoxious
Surgeon of the dead
Demented doctor
Forensic eminence
Postmortem raptor
Plunder in the tombs
With nauseous intentions
Dead bodies I exhume

... Surgeon of the dead
... Surgeon of the dead

I am obnoxious
King of the Sick
Insane Mortician
Obscene Pathologist
Depraved and vicious
Vampire of gore
Mortuary abductor
A vulture in the morgue

I am Obnoxious
Idol for the mad
Necrotic butcher
Scavenger of death
Furtive exhumer
Addicted to Rot
Dismembering corpses
Pathology is my job

... Surgeon of the dead
... Surgeon of the dead

Back in the morgue, my mind is getting sicker
The world will puke when I reveal my secrets
Eye for an eye ... Dissected witness
Suffer my wrath before you die in sickness
