FRAGMENTS (ANATOMICAL RELICS)

Desecrating - digging up th grave
I search in the coffins for my loathsome preys
Recollections of a macabre work
Fragments of the corpses in my private morgue

Eviscerating - innards I remove
Then I excavate to te gastric core

Expurgation, I dissect with care
Strict exploitation I excise just the rare
Amputations of limp extremities
Extremities as formal the hyde wash the cavities

My bistoury carves putrefacted remains
Separating muscles, nerves and veins
Embalming liquids isolate the dead tissues
Cauterizing enzymatic issues

Scouring piece by piece... Aseptic and clean
Suturing limb by limb... Artistic and obscene

Bizarre muzeum of sick anatomy
Patulous cadavers exhibited just for me
Sordid collection of collection of abducted body parts
Deformed foetus floating into jars

Scouring piece by piece... Aseptic and clean
Suturing limb by limb... Artistic and obscene.
