INCINERATOR OF CADAVERIC LEFTOVERS

Mutilated body parts autopsied human pieces
Portions of sectioned bowels full of fetid feces
Septic wastes from the morgue must be eliminated
Piles of putrefying remains will be incinerated

... Corpses on fire
...Sick funeral pyre
...Crematory fumes
...Blackened remains

Rectal gases deflegrate causing little explosions
Rotten innards melt away internal combustion
Smouldering sebaceous cysts calding pulped brain
Evaporating corporal fluids turned into methane

... Corpses on fire
...Sick funeral pyre
...Crematory fumes
...Blackened remains

Blazing eye-sockets lungs fume away
Roasted organs your heart is aflame
Boiling testicles fused membranes
Crepitating ashes of carbonized remains.
