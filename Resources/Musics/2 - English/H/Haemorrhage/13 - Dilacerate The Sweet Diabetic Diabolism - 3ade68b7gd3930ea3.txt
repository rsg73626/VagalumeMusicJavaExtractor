DILACERATE THE SWEET DIABETIC DIABOLISM

... If I can't have my food
I'll have her arteries
Devouring in love
Give me your blood

My digestive sytem poisoned by sugar
Glucose is the mania, internal sweet collapse
Like at sadistic torrent diabetes attack
Eviscerating my victims (worshiping the sugar)

Inverted cadavers in my operating room
Contemplating my artwork in the psychiatric room
Hooks from the sky I am the cancer
Butchered by sugar I am the necromancer

I'll dilacerate all my cadavers
With a dirty knife
Rituals of sweetness
Madness of an in human mind

My digestive system
Bloody sugar's the killer of my life

Diabetes nocturnal fetish of the sugar
I worship the sweet, worship your death
I worship the knife, worship your life
