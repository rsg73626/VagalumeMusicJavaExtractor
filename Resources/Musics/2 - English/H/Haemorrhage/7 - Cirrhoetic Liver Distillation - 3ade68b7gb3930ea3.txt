CIRRHOETIC LIVER DISTILLATION

The festering hepatic fibrosis
Swollen liver fermented day by day
septic Ichor smells like liquor
Vital organs in alcoholic decay
...Bile not Wine
...Pus not juice
Extracting the poisonous fluids
Toxic liquids in my cup
Ingestion of rancid urine
I will vomit...I am drunk

Severe cirrhosis
Alcohol-soaked tissues
Distillate the liver
to drink the hepatic lush
Purulent secretions
Fermenting insides
Macerating organs
I get high on bile
