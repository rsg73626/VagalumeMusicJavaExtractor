DERANGED FOR LOATHSOME

"..Pale skin shines in the darkness of the morgue
Deathlike atmosphere is filled with the stench of rot
Displeasant, repulsive and grim
Caught in the morbid attraction of the obscene

The sick and the beauty - divergent concepts
The Cult of the Emetic - deviated taste
Pathological perversion - necrologic spell
Happy in putrefaction..."

I'm deranged for loathsome - deranged for gore

Emaciated faces marked by the last death-throe
Process of rotheness manifested in the corpse
Dead bodies I dismember with love
Adipocere lubricates my latex gloves

Lain on the mortuary table
The stage where I act
Instruments gleams in the dark (necrotomy starts)
Dura-Mater I extract

I'm deranged for loathsome - deranged for gore

[POEM:]
"..Pale skin shines in the darkness of the morgue
Deathlike atmosphere is filled with the stench of rot
Displeasant, repulsive and grim
Caught in the morbid attraction of the obscene
The sick and the beauty - divergent concepts
The Cult of the Emetic - deviated taste
Pathological perversion - necrologic spell
Happy in putrefaction... I'm deranged "

Dismembered torsos I slice and explore
Removing intestines - pathology I adore

Corpses cause affection their members I collect
I'm an artist of mutilation
I live to dissect
