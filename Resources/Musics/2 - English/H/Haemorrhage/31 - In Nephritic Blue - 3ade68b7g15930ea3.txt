IN NEPHRITIC BLUE

Macerating in cellular reject
Toxic liquids are deadly retained
Incrustation of crescent nephrite
poisoned cruor urocemic fomite

Nephrosis...
In nephrotic blue...
The color...
Of my dead tissues

Strangulation of renal conducts
Pungent vomit of hepatic fluids
Intoxicated by cirrhoetic foam
Subit spasm my liver I disgorge

Rigor mortis muscles stiff
Now my urine starts to flow free... <i>[repeat]
