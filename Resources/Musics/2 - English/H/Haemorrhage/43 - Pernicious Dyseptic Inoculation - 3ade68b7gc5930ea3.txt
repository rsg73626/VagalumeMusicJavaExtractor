PERNICIOUS DYSEPTIC INOCULATION

Virulent contamination injected in your veins
Sympthomatology is evident
Mordicant contagion of the sanguineous cruor
Pathogenesis out break
Arthritic members swell as your body shivers
Semiparalized by pain
Pustules release a chorous secretion
Of gangrenous purulence

Pernicious plague... Of swarming virulence
Created to infest... There's no defence

Infestation - boiling in your scabs
Incubation - engendred in the lad
Aftermath of septicaemia
Suppuration - seeps out of the pores
Inoculation - infected to the gore

Infectious carbuncles macerated by sanies
Blisters expanded on your face
Microscopic terrorist in your organism
Septic havoc in your flesh
Nausea convulse your stomach(pre-emetic retch)
A black vomit is discharged
Effortless defecation of viscid faecal grume
fetid dysenteric scum

Pernicious plague... Of swarming virulence
Created to infest... There's no defence
