MANGLED SURGICAL EPITAPH

Foul stench corrupts the air - Necrotomy is over
(the) Morgue seems a battlefield full of dissected corpses

Sculptures of decay
Slaughtered remains
Engraved in rotten flesh
Abstract creation

On carnal monuments I scrawl my poems
To glorify the as I slice their bodies
Sculptures of decay
Slaughtered remains
Engraved in rotten flesh
Abstract creation

Cryptic nauseous scripts
Obscene tribute to the sick
Grotesque funeral art
Decomposed epitaph

Carved in flesh ... Artistic carnage
My blade will trace a maimed homage
Detruncated and deformed, mutilated, disembowelled
My butchery legacy is exhumed by the coroners

Cryptic nauseous scripts
Obscene tribute to the sick
Grotesque funeral art
