MIDNIGHT MORTICIAN

Years have passed but I can't forget
Mortified by Loathing Visions
Psychotic nightmares in my head
What I saw became my obsession

Exhumed in the dark
Flesh torn apart
Crippling the dead
Midnight Mortician
Enslaved to dissect
Maim and molest
Sick and insane
Midnight Mortician

Late at night he works alone
Through the recent graves he wanders
Abducting corpses from the Morgue
The mortuary crypts he plunders

Exhumed in the dark
Flesh torn apart
Crippling the dead
Midnight Mortician
Enslaved to dissect
Maim and molest
Sick and insane
Midnight Mortician

Blood and corpses everywhere
Bowels upon the dissecting table
Disgorging as you remind
A raving feast of mutilation

Exhumed in the dark
Flesh torn apart
Crippling the dead
Midnight Mortician
Enslaved to dissect
Maim and molest
Sick and insane
Midnight Mortician
