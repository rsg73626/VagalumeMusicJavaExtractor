DEFORMED (GRAVE)

Wired by the smell of death
As your end is drawing near

He make yo cry he make you bleed
But you feel no fucking fear God won't wake you from your sleepBanished from life
the stinking air
Drastic suffering,
you are deformedDEFORMEDYour screams fill the stinking air
Painful death is waiting youGod won't wake you from your sleepBanished from life
the stinking air
Drastic suffering,
you are deformedRevolting face
putrid remains
One eye left,
bloody handsBanished from life
the stinking air
Drastic suffering,
you are deformed...
