A CATALEPTIC RAPTURE

Midnight at the Cemetary
the Ghouls of Gore are back
Obnoxious and Corpsegrinder
look for some preys tonight
They tear apart the gravestone
Unearthing without care
Reopening your coffin
They think you are really dead

Desecrate...Steal the corpses from their graves
Digging up the interred
We are the raptors of the dead

Taken from the cemetary
to their hideous Morgue
Sinister body snatchers
Merchants of rot
Exhumed to be dissected
a few hours after death
Prematurely buried body
In cataleptic state

Desecrate...Steal the corpses from their graves
Digging up the interred
We are the raptors of the dead

Moonlight shines in your livid skin
Resting in apparent morbidity
There's life behind that unanimated eyes
Sometimes Cadaverous condition lies

A Cataleptic rapture, forensic mistake
Buried without death certicate
