GROTESQUE EMBRYOPATHOLOGY

Ugly and deformed, breeding into the womb,
Monstrosity, shapeless mash of limbs
Severe malformations disfigured the child
Embryonic displasia defaced him within
Gristly stillborn, floating into his tomb
Uterine grave where foetus decays

Corporal puzzle of twisted limbs
Horrid amorphous extremeties
Accessory members over wrong places
Two-headed baby with monstrous faces

"Interrupted gestation by abortive drugs
Has affected the growth of foetus
Turned into a monster, treated with foeticides
A new life is mangled forever..."

Cesarian section to help the birth
When foetus is out there is no mirth
Gynecologist vomits, mother desmays
'cause of the vision of baby's remains

"Interrupted gestation by abortive drugs
Has affected the growth of foetus
Turned into a monster, treated with foeticides
A new life is mangled forever..."

Miscarriage... Monstrosity... Horrendous pathology...

The little corpse is studied now
By doctors in the morgue
On a bloody embryonic autopsy
Dilacerating its entrails
Subsequently displaced
Fragile members torn and mutilated

Repulsive necropsy
Craneotomy in two parts
Separate the double brain
Cutting joined heads thru the middle
Union through out the thorax
Vital organs ablated
Soft spine brutally split open

Recomposition after carnage
The baby's body is mummified
Erasing all the bodily scars
Medical funeral in a chloroform jar

"Interrupted gestation by abortive drugs
Has affected the growth of foetus
Turned into a monster, treated with foeticides
A new life is mangled forever..."

Miscarriage... Monstrosity... Horrendous pathology...
