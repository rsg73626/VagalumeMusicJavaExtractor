FUNERAL CARNAGE

Carbonized bodies
Melting human slag
Picked up by coroners
With vomitive disgust
Vestiges of the slaughter
Dismembered trunks
Collective coffins
For splattered limbs and chunks

Funeral Carnage
Funeral Carnage

Putrescent leftovers
Stale necrotic swag
Quartered cadavers
Wrapped in plastic bags
Wormeaten carrion
In festering decay
Rotting together
In purulent mass graves

Funeral Carnage

... Rotting Funeral Carnage

Decomposed residue minced and burnt
Noxious cremation
Clandestine burial of corporal parts
... Meat for dissection
