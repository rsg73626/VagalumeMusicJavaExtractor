DAWN IN THE ROTTING PARADISE

I'm dead... I feel so...
I'm shocked by horrible visions
A dream? ...Delirium?
I'm trying to find any reason

I'm in hell
I hear maggots swarm by my side
What is this place?
Many questions for my mind

I'm trapped...in darkness
underneath a pile of cadavers
I cry...in silence
I'm horrified by the macabre

I'm in hell
I feel the Icecold flesh by my side
Pestilent Place
Too much horror for my grave

Confused...
Forsaken...
Awaken...
In the rotting paradise
