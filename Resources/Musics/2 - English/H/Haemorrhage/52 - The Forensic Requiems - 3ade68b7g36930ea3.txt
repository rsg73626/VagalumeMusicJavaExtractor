THE FORENSIC REQUIEMS

Certify the tragedy of the physical defunction
Butchered cadavers are blessed by my morbid extreme unction
Prone on the mortuary table for the forensic inquest
Post-mortem identification is a job that I detest

"Performing my disgusting autopsies
on festered human remains
I will hearse the lifeless bodies
In putrefactive decay"

Execrable procedures, sordid posthumous defilement
Desecrating their insides with necrophiliac excitement
Effervescing paroxysm of the foetid, stale and rancid
Extirpated revelations of malignant putremancy

"Performing my disgusting autopsies
on festered human remains
I will hearse the lifeless bodies
In putrefactive decay"

Dissecting as I pray my last rites for the dead
Forever they will rest in putrefaction ...

Crimson icons - doctrine of gore
Rotting corpses mangled in the morgue

The forensic requiems ...
For the brutally deceased
Surgical exequies
Dead will never rest in peace

Into the Emetic Cult - Ceremonial mutilation
Liturgic surgery for the obit celebration

"Performing my disgusting autopsies
on festered human remains
I will hearse the lifeless bodies
In putrefactive decay"

Dissecting as I pray my last rites for the dead
Forever they will rest in putrefaction ...

Crimson icons - doctrine of gore
Rotting corpses mangled in the morgue

The forensic requiems ...
For the brutally deceased
Surgical exequies
Dead will never rest in peace

Torn apart and disposed
Human waste is left to rot
I don't care if you're dead or not

Quartered and defiled
Odious shrine of sacrifice
My revenge won't be left behind
... your corpse is mine ...
