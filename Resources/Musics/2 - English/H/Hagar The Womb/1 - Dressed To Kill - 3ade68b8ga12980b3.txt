DRESSED TO KILL

Saturday nights coming and I've just got to prepare
Have a bath and spend two hours washing my hair
'Cos you know I've got to have my face just right. Right!
So all the boys will only fall for me tonight tonight!

Gotta try my best, best, best
To stand out from there rest, rest, rest
To make sure that he, he, he
Will only fancy me, me, me

In my sequinwed boob top I'll really stand out on the floor
Make sure the boys will come crawling back begging for more
With a flashing smile and tons and tons of cheap perfume. Perfume!
They'll soon realize I'm the best piece in the room. Room!

Gotta try my best, best, best
To stand out from there rest, rest, rest
To make sure that he, he, he
Will only fancy me, me, me

I don't care if I trip or catch a chill
'Cos in my flimsy clothes I wanna look dressed to kill
Make myself out to be really, really, really hot stuff. Stuff!
Tease the boys make sure they never get enough. Enough!

With every single boy in the room I will flirt
I don't care if I'm used or treated like dirt
I don't even care if they call me a tart. Tart!
Cos I know they reall meant to say sweetheart. Heart!
(Come with me!)
Come with me!

Gotta try my best, best, best
To stand out from there rest, rest, rest
To make sure that he, he, he
Will only fancy me, me, me
Fancy me
Fancy me
Me!
