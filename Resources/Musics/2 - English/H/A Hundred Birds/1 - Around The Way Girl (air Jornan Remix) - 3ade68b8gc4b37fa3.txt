AROUND THE WAY GIRL (AIR JORNAN REMIX)

Kawarane nothin' change girl
Ore no name girl, sphere of influence (that's right)
Ageru fame girl, hey sexy cute na play girl
Boys mina jumpin huntin' like kangol let's go
Karada de rinku suru chu-n girl taste like strawberry
Lick suru bagel asa made beddosaido de
Make-up hey what's your name girl (aile)
Around da way girl

Mou nido to onaji ayamachi wa okasanai
