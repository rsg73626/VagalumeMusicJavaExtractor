ALVA

Sweet laughter fills the air tonight
A journey has begun
To fantasy forests, where wishes come true
Where animals talk and legends live

Little leaf boat in the moonbeam glides
A crystal palace in sight
Loveliest girl barefoot into the grass leaps
Joy of the elven world greet them from me

Oh, Alva, winds singing mild
"grace to the fairies for the elven child"
May the North-star be your guide
May it shine upon you bright

Hear the language of the woods
Seek the treasures of the hidden realm
You enchant us with your loving smile
May the magic ever dance in your heart
