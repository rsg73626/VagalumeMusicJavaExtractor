WHERE THE LONELY SOULS GO

Where The Lonely Souls Go

Won't you come inside?
Rest a while, you must be tired
It has been a long way
But it's not far before you reach your goal
The end of this road
Another step to the new dimension
Before you travel on
Let me hear your story

Where do you come from, tell me of your early days
Tell me of gladness, sorrows, was your winter long and cold?
How did you let go?
Tell me and I will listen all night
At dawn I will wish you well
When you go where the lonely souls go

It seems so long ago
The memory of years long gone
One day I'll be there
At the crossroad where time has no name
Will I pass on or will I return?
Will you meet me
When I go where the lonely souls go?

And the man in a blue cloak
Smiles at me, he speaks to me
But I cannot hear for his words fade with the dream
The answers I seek, I will, I will never know
Will you show me?
Won't you tell me where the lonely souls go?

And you out there, lost ones,
Hiding within a crowd
Searching for the other soul
That you once left behind
You will also stand here at the end of the road, the crossing point
And alone you will go...
Where the lonely souls go
