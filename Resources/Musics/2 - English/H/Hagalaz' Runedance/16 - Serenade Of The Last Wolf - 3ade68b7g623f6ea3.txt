SERENADE OF THE LAST WOLF

He runs into the night
Finding a place to hide
Why do they hunt him again?
His heart, it beats so fast
No sound, they moved on at last
Timidly he wanders his way.

He only came for some food
Maybe even company
Sometimes he feels so alone.
He is the last one of his kind
All his companions have died
Man signed their fatal destiny

His dreams tell him of ancient times
Of wolves and men running side by side
How delightful freedom must have been
Wild woman's mate and totem-beast
Idolised he was, but suddenly all changed
When the men with false dogmas came

You call him the "evil beast"?
But you are the real evil beast!
You, who damned nature's dear child
He cries his sorrow to the moon
A tear shines through the misty gloom
Can't you hear the last wolfs serenade?

Alone he sits by the lake
His image in the lake his only friend
Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?
