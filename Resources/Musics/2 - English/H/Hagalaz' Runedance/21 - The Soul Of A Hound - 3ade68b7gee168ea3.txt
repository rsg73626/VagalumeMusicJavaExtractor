THE SOUL OF A HOUND

The Soul Of A Hound

When I found you I wandered dreading for the day to come
Our years went past; your life went fast,
Forever you're leaving me now

Farewell my beauty; raven black friend
My sweet companion
My tears shall be my promise
That you're always in my heart

Always in my heart...

... Always...
