THE OATH HE SWORE ONE WINTERS' DAY

A snowed in forest path
With lament I dream of long forgotten times
An image comes to my mind
Of a young man riding through the frozen woods

In his eyes rage and bitter tears
His village was burnt to the ground
He storms forth, crying out his pain
He is driven by his mothers last words:

Raise your sword, my warrior
And revenge us
Fight the men that came to rape our souls
Never let our gods die.

Hi's loved ones were no more
The false men with cross slaughtered them all
They tried to enforce strange rules
Which were only meant to turn men to fools

His people saw through the lies
They stood proud until the end of their time
By the false men they were shamed
Young man for your honour you will have to die.

Raise your sword, my warrior
And revenge us
Fight the men that came to rape our soil
Never let nature die

My vision ends here
And I return to the modern world
Suddenly I see a young man walking
Sad blue eyes in a bitter face
And there's a young man in the east
And another in the west
And another raising from the south
They all move on driven by the call:

Raise yourself, warrior
And revenge us
Fight the men with cross that raped our souls
Never let our gods die

Raise yourself, warrior
And revenge us
Fight the men with cross that raped our soil
Never let nature die
