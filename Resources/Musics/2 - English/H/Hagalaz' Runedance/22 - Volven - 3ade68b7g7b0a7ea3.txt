VOLVEN

Facing the storm by the shore 
In sacred colours her foremothers wore 
Calling to the sea the Vardlokkur 
In ancient tongue that none can understand but her 
:.Volva's call 
Volva bring their messages to me 
The seed that you will pass on to me 
I hear the voices from within 
Old wise one I am bare, I am prepared, 
I'm ready to step inside 
The circle's closing we hear the chants 
Magic rythms seducing us to dance 
Eyes are closing, what will they see? 
Lost in the search of ancient dreams and ages yet to come 
The heat is rising, seething wild 
Bodies trembling as the earth underneath 
And when I'm falling into the depths of life 
Drowning hearts in ecstasy, screaming for the dawn 
:when our souls were young
