ALBION AUTUMN

Albion Autumn

Albion Autumn, where did the heart go?
Here where the land ends
We cry to the ocean
Words swallowed by the wind
Voices are fading
Words disappear

Albion Autumn, where did the will go?
Below the crushing sea
Deep is the water
Kneeling by the edge
Lips kissed faintly
Will I see again?

Albion Autumn... take me there
