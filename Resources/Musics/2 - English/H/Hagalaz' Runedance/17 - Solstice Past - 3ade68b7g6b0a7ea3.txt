SOLSTICE PAST

Crimson summer sky 
sundown has come 
trees cloaked in shadows 
what would I find beyond? 
As I'm watching, thinking, waiting for the night to fall 
could I only turn the time 
could I stop this moment 
Grey summer sky, 
the trees swing softly 
come summer rain 
and kiss my skin 
tears in my eyes mingle with the raindrops 
warm winds blow my face dry 
yet, still I cannot see 
From the woods I hear my name 
passions of summer-time 
I follow the whisper 
enthralled by the magic 
Tell me secrets 
the life-blood of nature 
but underneath the green moss 
their traces disappeared 
Oh, what I see, what I feel 
Oh, could it be a memory? 
or is it mere fantasy? 
Hide away the pain, 
when no words could ever explain 
Midsummer night 
bewitched by the light 
at solstice fires 
the wheel burns bright 
Join the dance, celebrate the peak of life 
Cast away the reality that 
the fall has began. 
Summer will pass 
but the sun shall return 
summer nights will be 
but how many more to see? 
While I'm watching, breathing 
taken by the summer air 
The vision may still be 
the moment's gone forever. 
From the woods I hear my name 
passions of summer-time 
I follow the whisper 
enthralled by the magic 
Tell me secrets 
the life-blood of nature 
but underneath the green moss 
their traces disappeared 
Oh, what I see, what I feel 
Oh, could it be a memory? 
or is it mere fantasy? 
Hide away the pain, 
when no words could ever explain
