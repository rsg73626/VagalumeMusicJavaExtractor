SEEKER DIVINE

Gentle breeze my mind revives
longing eyes gaze into the sky
high above two ravens fly
Can this not be a sign for me?
High one are you guarding me?
 
Hidden face with many names
one-eyed master of disguise
unknown you wander for few to see
mystery-man, are you watching me?
I seek, I yearn, will you answer me?
 
Come Odin, come wise Odin
Keeper of thought and memory
seeker of shadows, seeker of truth
my thirst for life I offer to you
 
Come Odin, come one-eyed Odin
Lord of battle and self-sacrifice
wounded king raise the spirit in me
your guidance shall be my victory
 
I seek your thoughts, you seek my kind
shaman, you met the feminine side
ancient secrets, ecstasy cries
Master of runes, will you show me?
My seeker divine, will you join with me?
 
Come Odin, come wise Odin
Keeper of thought and memory
seeker of shadows, seeker of truth
my thirst for life I offer to you
 
Come Odin, come one-eyed Odin
Lord of battle and self-sacrifice
wounded king raise the spirit in me
your guidance shall be my victory
 
You have died in their hearts,
you have died in their souls
But I, I have always remembered
 
Come Odin, come wise Odin
Keeper of thought and memory
seeker of shadows, seeker of truth
my thirst for life I offer to you
 
Come Odin, come one-eyed Odin
Lord of battle and self-sacrifice
wounded king raise the spirit in me
your guidance shall be my victory
