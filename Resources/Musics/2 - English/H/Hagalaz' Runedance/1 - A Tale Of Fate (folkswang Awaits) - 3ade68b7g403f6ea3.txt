A TALE OF FATE (FOLKSWANG AWAITS)

They met on a hill one late autumn eve
Oh, noble and graceful both stood
With eyes so intense, their passion so fierce
The wildest flame burning inside
He was the son of a powerful Viking Jarl
She was a child blessed by Freya in all her ways
Silently they watched the endless sea
And time came to say farewell

"The ships are leaving tomorrow morning
Far away to foreign lands
The battlefields call, my fathers to follow
Proving that I am a man
With honour in my breast I will win my battles
My love to you will give me my strength to live
And when I return all souls will know
That you are my true wife to be"

Joy in her heart, she summoned the Norns
To see what their marriage will bring
But the Norns only shook sadly their heads
Their future, oh they had seen...
â€˜sometimes my child, fate cannot be kind'
These words; she tumbled down screaming and weeping
She called upon elves, begged Freya and Odin
"No, don't take my dear from me"

But Orlog had spoken their destiny
Oh no use all the spell craft she tried
One dawn in her dream she saw him falling
The blade of a sword in his side
He fell to his knees, his dying eyes searching her
Breathing his last breath as he cried out her name loud
That dreadful morning she awoke
And she knew that he had died

The day came when the ship returned
The body of her loved one bore
She sat down beside him, a last pained look
At his young body once more
Than she pierced her heart with her dagger of iron
Her dying body onto his chest fell
They are now united in Esgard high
For all eternity
