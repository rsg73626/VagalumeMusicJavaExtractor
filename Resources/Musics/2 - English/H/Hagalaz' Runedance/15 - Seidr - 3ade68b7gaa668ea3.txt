SEIDR

Seidr is an ancient northern form of magic,
comparable to the practice of shamanism and Wicca (witchcraft).
It was practised mainly by women and often in connection with fertility-rites,
making use of intense emotions and natural substances.
Seidr practise involves entering a trance, allowing the mind to travel to other dimensions of reality.
here the practitioner would communicate with spirits, totem-animals or gods
