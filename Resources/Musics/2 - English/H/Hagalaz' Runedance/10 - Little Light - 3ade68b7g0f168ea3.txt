LITTLE LIGHT

Little Light

Oh, little light
Sweet little child
Brought into this world
Helpless small soul
Naked and cold
So much warmth you need

Oh, little light
Poor little child
Too easy you were made
They owned no mind
Nor know a heart
They do not care for your pain

Most heartbreaking sight
See the fright
In the eyes of a tormented child
When I see in my mind
I cannot bear their cries
Oh, could I save all those innocent lives

Oh, little light
Dead little child
They blew out your flame
Where are you now?
Have you found love?
Has your soul left your lonely grave?

How could there be such deeds?
Oh, could I curse such fiends!
Be they haunted eternally!

Don't give me excuse
'Cause nothing can make right
Hurting a helpless child
