THE FALCON FLIES

Rain falls from a dark-grey sky
I sense the falcon near
Across the nine worlds he flies
A silent voice my call
He seeks my soul

He sinks down to the underworld
And flies into my dream
He lifts me up while I sleep
And carries me away
I slip away

We fly over mountains
Over seas raging wild
I see trees shaken by the storm
And villages in peaceful dormancy

A shaman reaches out
To greet the one-eyed man
I see the past, the present and
The future melt to one timeless void

A mystic moor-land comes to sight
An unknown path ahead
Elves dancing around me
Could this not be an everlasting dream?
