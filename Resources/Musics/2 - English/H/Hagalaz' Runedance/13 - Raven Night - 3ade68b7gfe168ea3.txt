RAVEN NIGHT

Raven Night

Lost in the neon twilight
I feel my nature waking inside
Would you look towards me?
Would you dare to enter the threshold to my mind?

Can you see me dancing?
A silent voice singing for you
Hear my Raven call
Would you be enchanted and follow me?

Lost is but a dream fading
And soon I'm calling out again
Would you come to release me?
Would you tear the icy chains from my skin?
