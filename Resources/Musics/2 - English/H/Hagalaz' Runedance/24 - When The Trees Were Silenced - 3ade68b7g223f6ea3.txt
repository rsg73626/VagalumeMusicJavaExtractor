WHEN THE TREES WERE SILENCED

When the trees were silenced
Yggdrasil's children fell
Bloodstained leaves decaying
And no one was left to tell
The tales of the gods, of fates
And of the timeless worlds
Wisdom we people once knew
Of the wonders of life
And of nature's own way...

When the trees were silenced
By the ones that fooled you well
When the trees were silenced
Because they know the truth to tell
Sorrow is the name of their song
The memory lives on
The spirit of the green man has gone
Why has it been so long?
The seeker hears the cries within

Will you remember the trees proud and tall?
Will you listen and answer nature's call?
See, your dead world is starting to fall
Let life return
