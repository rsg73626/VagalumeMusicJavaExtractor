BEHOLD THE PASSIONATE WAYS OF NATURE

Maiden moon, mystic lamp of the night,
Thy silver shine guides my way.
The gates to the other side are open wide
And my mind drifts so far away.
Thou enchant my soul and seduce my flesh
Whilst thou whisper thy secrets to me.
With the ghosts of fog I dance in thy light
Till the dawn lifts the spell of me.

Rising sun I welcome thee,
Young Balders' smile upon thy face.
Thou bring the day, cast the shadow away,
Thy holy flames the sky embrace.
Thou warm the soil and thou warm my heart
And feed me the strength that I need.
On solstice night shall we celebrate
May the most sacred torch ever be.

Honour be to our Mother Earth,
The blessing of the gods upon thee.
Thou give us life and thou taketh it,
For life to go on eternally.
Show me the wonders within this world
â€˜cause I shall never fail to see
That merriment, grief and life and death
Are altogether bound within thee.
