JONAH

Jonah you're still young, boy 
Jonah you're still young 
You're gonna be a man when your daddy gets done 
You're gonna be a man, boy 
You're gonna be a man 
You got to beat your children the best that you can 

This world gonna knock you down, boy 
This world gonna knock you down 
Put your navy face flat on the ground 
You can get back up and then, boy 
You get back up and then 
This world gonna knock you right back down again 

Jonah you're still young, boy 
Jonah you're still young 
You're gonna be a man when your daddy gets done 
What you need is a sign 
In these ever changing times 
To give to you a place where you can shine 

Your good gal wants to roll, boy 
Your good gal wants to roll 
She'll leave you walking this world all alone 
Walk this far alone, boy 
Walk this far alone 
You ain't got no reason, you ain't got no home 

Jonah you're still young, boy 
Jonah you're still young 
You're gonna be a man when your daddy gets done 
What you need is a sign 
In these ever changing times 
To give to you a place where you can shine
