MY BODY

I just love it when you come to me And you want me And itâ€™s all unexpected 

Here we are Alone in a room Only dressed by a shadow Me and you 

My lips are dry Better kiss me quick Not a ticklish lick Just put some pressure on it 

That's it, right there That's it, right there That's it, right there That's it, right there 

Tangled tongues Dancing around Your hands on my skin Going down 

You got me weak in the knees I cannot controle this You got me tamed Not many man can do this 

You know my body Like nobody Never felt so naughty Oh boy you got it We don't need no bed At least not yet It feels so good When it's unexpected 

Light as a feather Your fingertips Searching my body 

You got me weak in the knees I cannot controle this You got me tamed Not many man can do this 

You know my body Like nobody Never felt so naughty Oh boy you got it We don't need no bed At least not yet It feels so good When it's unexpected 

I feel so good So good, so good, so good I feel so good I feel so good 

You know my body Like nobody Never felt so naughty Oh boy you got it We don't need no bed At least not yet It feels so good When it's unexpected 

You know my body (your touch) Like nobody (your lips) Never felt so naughty (your featherlike) Oh boy you got it (fingertips) We don't need no bed At least not yet (And it feels) It feels so good (so good) When it's unexpected (so good) 

That's it, right there That's it, right there That's it, right there That's it, right here
