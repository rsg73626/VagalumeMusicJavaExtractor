SISTER

Thinking about the days that I spend with my sisters
They’re the reason of my pearcing smile
No matter what I do no matter where I am
I will love them till the end

No one will ever know
Cuz we live by the secret code

Chorus:
Sister ain’t no mister
Coming between us
Oh no no no
Sister ain’t no mister
Who’s gonna devide us
Oh no no no

Nobody can break us up even if they try
No one knows how strong we are
We’ll do what it takes for eachother
My 2 sisters are my shining star

No one will ever know
Cuz we live by the secret code

Chorus:
Sister ain’t no mister
Coming between us
Oh no no no
Sister ain’t no mister
Who’s gonna devide us
Oh no no no
