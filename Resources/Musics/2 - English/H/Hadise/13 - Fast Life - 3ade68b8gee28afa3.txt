FAST LIFE

I’m always on the go I go from show to show Airplanes, taxicabs take me to the next spot 

I travel around the world It’s always in and out Airplanes, taxicabs, hotels, restaurants Go go go go 

Bridge 
Yeah I’ve seen a lot of places Yeah I’ve seen a lot of faces Every day it’s hard to find love When you lead a fast life 

Chorus 
Fast life I can’t slow down I’m always running around, running around, running around On my high heels Try walking a mile on these I’m always running, running around, chasing time 

Fast life Sometimes I’m running on stress Fast life When my schedule’s a mess 

I’m always on the go Even when I’m feeling slow Airplanes, taxicabs take me to the next spot 

Pack your suitcase There’s no time to waist Airplanes, taxicabs, hotels, restaurants Go go go 

Bridge 
Yeah I’ve seen a lot of places Yeah I’ve seen a lot of faces Every day it’s hard to find love When you lead a fast life 

Fast life I can’t slow down Fast life Yeah yeah yeah… 

Go go Go go 

When I’m flying high, high up in the sky I think about the life I’m leaving behind
