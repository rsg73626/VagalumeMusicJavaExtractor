HERO

I see you; you’re sleeping That’s what you always do Been fighting this feeling; I can’t look up to you 

Won’t look to the past I just got to move on And leave all I have Being sad made me strong Won’t look to the past Now I’m turning the page And wait for a blast Cause my hero’s on his way 

I’m stuck in your chapter The same scene every day We’re lonely together I need to break away 

Won’t look to the past I just got to move on And leave all I have Being sad made me strong Won’t look to the past Now I’m turning the page And wait for a blast Cause my hero’s on his way
