MILK CHOCOLATE GIRL

Every woman knows what I mean
Chocolate sounds just like a dream
The sweet taste makes ya wanna scream
A lot of woman say its better than ya know what I mean

Milkchocolate girl I’m a chocoholic wrapped in foil
I’m a milkchocolate girl it aint pure but that’s my world
My sweet thoot needs to byte into it hide into a chocolate world
I’m a milkchocolate girl licking my fingers clean

I wish I could wake up in a chocolate land
Where everything is made of chocolate and
I can eat everything that’s in my hand
Fantasy’s about it again and again

Milkchocolate girl I’m a chocoholic wrapped in foil
I’m a milkchocolate girl it aint pure but that’s my world
My sweet thoot needs to byte into it hide into a chocolate world
I’m a milkchocolate girl licking my fingers clean

Breeze thru life on a milky cloud
All the ladies know what I’m talking about

Milkchocolate girl I’m a chocoholic wrapped in foil
I’m a milkchocolate girl it aint pure but that’s my world
My sweet thoot needs to byte into it hide into a chocolate world
I’m a milkchocolate girl licking my fingers clean
