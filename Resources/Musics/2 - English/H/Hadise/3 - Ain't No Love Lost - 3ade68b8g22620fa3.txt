AIN'T NO LOVE LOST

Ain’t no love lost, just a little rust
We can get through this, ain’t no love lost
Ain’t no love lost, just look at us
We can get through this, ain ‘t no love lost

It’s three years now we’ve been together
And 1 or 2 things have changed
Makin’ love is now a cold
Shower each day
I know that somethings gotta change
Before it feels too strange
And if there’s no one to blame
Shouldn’t we feel the same?
I know I still love you baby,
but something here is gone
And I don’t want to hurt you baby,
but something here is wrong

Ain’t no love lost, just a little rust
We can get through this, ain’t no love lost
Ain’t no love lost, just look at us
We can get through this, ain ‘t no love lost

Looking into the past,
one room was a blast
We didn’t have to go nowhere, now it’s always somewhere
Baby I still love you,
but something here is gone
And I don’t want to hurt you baby,
but something here is wrong

Ain’t no love lost, just a little rust
We can get through this, ain’t no love lost
Ain’t no love lost, just look at us
We can get through this, ain ‘t no love lost
