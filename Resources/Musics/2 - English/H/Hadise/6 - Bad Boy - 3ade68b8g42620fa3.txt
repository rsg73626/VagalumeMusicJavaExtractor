BAD BOY

All I want is a bad boy, that’s right I’m a bad girl.

I don’t care what you say.
I don’t care who you be.

I want a player who’s dressing well.
Take me anywhere I don’t care.
Show me off to your friends and stuff.
I let you know when I had enough.

Shake me, make me, take me, don’t break me.
Take me anywhere you want to.
I follow you, where ever you go.
I am here just to let you know.

When you’re driving your car around.
Pick me up and never let me down.
