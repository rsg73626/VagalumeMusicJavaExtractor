DOUBLE LIFE

Give me a moment to realize it Lying besides you seems so unreal… Still can’t believe it, I’ve tried to fight it I was afraid to feel what I feel In this cold cold life I need a torch, a guiding light And you’re that guy, you-ou’re the one Could you be mine, mine for all times Would you be mine, mine for all times 

I would live a double life Just to be with you It ain’t good and it ain’t right But it’s what I got to do I would live a double life Secret and taboo I don’t want to live a lie But I got to be with you 

I can’t feel sorry, cause this feels so good Laying besides you, feels like a dream Touch and hold me, kiss me all over Love me like I do, come stay with me In this cold cold life I need a torch, a guiding light And you’re that guy, you-ou’re the one Could you be mine, mine for all times Would you be mine, mine for all times 

I would live a double life Just to be with you It ain’t good and it ain’t right But it’s what I got to do I would live a double life Secret and taboo I don’t want to live a lie But I got to be with you
