WHEN YA BREATHING ON ME

If we’d stay all night on our pillow
Don’t wake up the sun in our shadow
Show no light of the dawn, don’t let the day through the door
All these come what mays, will crave for more

Your the apple I’m the sinner (this feels so right)
I’ll take a bite cause I wanna (so right)
Go down on me...

Chorus:
When ya breathin’ on me you make that ooh come about me
When you give it to me you make that ooh come about me

Oh oh ooohh x2

When ya breathin’ on me you make that ooh come about me
When you give it to me you make that ooh come about me

If we’d stay all night in this room
Just stay as long as the moon
If we could just be who we wanna be
Let nobody else kill the fantasy

This feels so right, this feels so right
when you go down on me

Your the apple I’m the sinner (this feels so right)
I’ll take a bite cause I wanna (so right)
Your the apple I’m the sinner
Go down on me...

Chorus:
When ya breathin’ on me you make that ooh come about me
When you give it to me you make that ooh come about me
When ya breathin’ on me you make that ooh come about me
When you give it to me you make that ooh come about me

Oh oh ooohh x4

This feels so right, this feels so right
when you go down on me
