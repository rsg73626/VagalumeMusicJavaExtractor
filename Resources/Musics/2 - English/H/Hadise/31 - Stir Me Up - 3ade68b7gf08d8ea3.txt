STIR ME UP

STIR ME UP, STIR ME UP
Make it hot, make it naughty 
STIR ME UP, STIR ME UP 
I like that,  boy you’ve got me 

I can see you standing there 
Checkin’ out the dress I wear 
But boy tell me first what's on your mind 

I know that you want me to 
Make you feel like your my boo 
So boy get me in the mood tonight 
That's right it's gotta be all or nothing 
Don't make me wait 
Let me know that ya want me 
I don't wanna sleep alone tonight 
You can stay as long as the moon is 
Shining in my little bedroom 
I just gotta have you by my side 
I don’t wanna sleep alone 
Tonight I gotta have you by my side 

STIR ME UP, STIR ME UP 
Make it hot, make it naughty 
STIR ME UP, STIR ME UP 
I like that,  boy you’ve got me 
X2 

I know I've been watching you 
You've been checkin’ on me to 
Oh boy, are you man enough for me 
Do just what ya gotta do 
I can taste the heat in you 
Oh boy, let me take a bite in you 
That's right it's gotta be all or nothing 
Don't make me wait 
Let me know that you want me 
I just gotta have you by my side 
I don’t wanna sleep alone 
Tonight I gotta have you by my side 

STIR ME UP, STIR ME UP 
Make it hot, make it naughty
STIR ME UP, STIR ME UP 
I like that,  boy you’ve got me

Seni istiyorum… 
Yaklas yanima sakin korkma 
Sana hastayim anlasana 
Yaklas yanima sakin korkma 
Sana hastayim bunu anlasana…
