JEALOUS

I’m gonna trap a man
Cause I could never stand
How he hurt my friend

I’m gonna have revenge
Make him feel the same
Make him feel the pain

He will come to me talk to me flirt with me
He’ll think he’s got me in the sack
Play with me lay it on me dance with me
Another play thing in the bag

Right then when you think you’re gonna get some
You’re gonna get none
This is my revenge...

I’m gonna make him jealous
Show him tonight what hell is
I’m gonna freak him out
I’m gonna take him out
I’m gonna I’m gonna...make him jealous

I...I wanna know, i wanna know what hurts you
I wanna know what alerts you
Your ego is my key
So I can break it off so I can break it off

He will come to me talk to me flirt with me
He’ll think he’s got me in the sack
Play with me lay it on me dance with me
Another play thing in the bag

Right then when you think you’re gonna get some
You’re gonna get none
This is my revenge...

I’m gonna make him jealous
Show him tonight what hell is
I’m gonna freak him out
I’m gonna take him out
I’m gonna I’m gonna...make him jealous

Just a fling ain’t my thing, it don’t matter what you bring
I’m gonna make him look the fool, I’m gonna make him sweat and druel
All the passion he has quenched, all the hurt he caused my friends
I’m gonna make him pay tonight, show my sisters he ain’t right

I’m gonna make him jealous
Show him tonight what hell is
I’m gonna freak him out
I’m gonna take him out
I’m gonna I’m gonna...make him jealous
