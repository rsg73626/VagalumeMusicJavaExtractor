that body working up a sweat 
for me 
that body soft and wet 
Can’t you see I’m working my ass off 
Oh mummy, got the body all soaking 
Yes you know, I remain showing 
Keep throwing, hands up, dropping jerseys 
Sew my ass with no damn attorney 
Yes you heard me, keep talking dirty 
So enjoy the damn status, wild and tameless 
Got the word framed famous 
Faces, moving over dangerous places 

that body working up a sweat 
for me 
that body soft and wet 
on me 
that body working up a sweat 
for me 
that body soft and wet 
on me 
Feel the music in the club now 
Feel the music in the club now 
Feel the music in the club now 
Feel the music in the club now
