DUM TEK TEK

Baby you're perfect for me
You are my gift from heaven
This is the greatest story of all times
We meet met in like in a movie
So meant to last forever
And what youre doing to me
Feels so fine

Angel I wake up
And live my dreams
Endlessly
Crazy for you

Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Dum Tek Tek
Always out it like there no minute
Feels like theres no way back
Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Dum Tek Tek
Always out it like theres no minute
Feels like theres no way back

Baby I read all answers
In your exotic movements
You are the greatest dancer of all times
You make me feel so special
No one can kiss like you do
As it is your profession
Feel so fine

Angel I wake up and live my dreams
Endlessly
Crazy for you

The beats going Dum Tek Tek
Always out it like theres no minute
Feels like theres no way back

Always out it like it no minute
Feels like theres no way back
Always out it like theres no minute
feels like Dum Tek Tek
