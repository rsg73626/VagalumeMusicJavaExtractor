PRISONER

She's the reason why you left me Does she please you like I did? Tell me And if she really makes you happy Then how come that I don't feel it, heyeah 

Why do you look so sad? Are you thinking of what we had? I know there'll come a day You will see you were wrong in the first place 

I can read it in your eyes You don't seem satisfied So boy it's clean to see You just wanna get back to me 

'Cause you know where the parties at Or you know where the parties at And I know that you can't forget What we had, how we kissed, how you felt 

So you know where the parties at And think of all the fun we'll have Oh, I know that you won't regret I make clean to her that you're not her prisoner 

She can't love you like I loved you I'll make you lose your mind Again and again 

I'll be Juliet tonight I'll keep my window open wide You know this could get so high Only once won't be enough 

You know where the parties at Or you know where the parties at And I know that you can't forget What we had, how we kissed, how you felt 

So you know where the parties at And think of all the fun we'll have Oh, I know that you won't regret I make clean to her that you're not her prisoner 

What has she done to you You're not the one I knew Your eyes were full of joy What happened to you boy? 

It's not too late to plan this big escape I think it's such a shame You have to loose what you have Just to know how you will 

You know where the parties at Or you know where the parties at And I know that you can't forget What we had, how we kissed, how you felt 

So you know where the parties at And think of all the fun we'll have Oh, I know that you won't regret I make clean to her that you're not her prisoner
