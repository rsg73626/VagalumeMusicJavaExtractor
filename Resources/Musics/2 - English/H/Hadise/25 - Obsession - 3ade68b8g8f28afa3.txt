OBSESSION

Tossing and Turning the whole night this ain’t no good My heart keeps on burning and hurting because of you 

Night after night this I see faces that scream in my head Voices say: ‘silly girl, don’t do things that you’re going to regret’ 

You’re the fantasy I longed for I want more You’re the enemy I ran for In inner wars You’re the keeper of the secrets Of my soul Are you playing with my feelings? I don’t know 

What you’re doing to me What you’re doing to me I’m drowning in your passion What you’re doing to me What you’re doing to me It’s worse than an obsession 

Tossing and turning it hurts not to be with you Dreams re-occurring but still not a dream come true 

Night after night I realize this is no good But I close my eyes just to hide from the painful truth 

You’re the fantasy I longed for I want more You’re the enemy I ran for In inner wars You’re the keeper of the secrets Of my soul Are you playing with my feelings? I don’t know 

What you’re doing to me What you’re doing to me I’m drowning in your passion What you’re doing to me What you’re doing to me It’s worse than an obsession
