I'LL TRY NOT TO CRY

Please don't stare too much - 
it's so revealing Just
one secret touch - 
could cut my feelings Just one
stolen kiss...might change my mind, ohhhh 

We knew it must end - 
this crazy story 
Can we still be friends - 
will we be sorry? 
There's no easy way...
when love's unkind, ohhhh 

I'll try not to cry - 
as I say goodbye to you 
I'll tell you no lies - 
coz I cannot hide the truth
 I'll try not to cry - 
as I say goodbye to you - 
it's so hard to tell you - 
it's so hard to tell you - 
now it's farewell 

All the days we had - 
The pain and pleasure 
Good times and the bad - 
I'll always treasure 
They'll keep all their charms - 
They'll still be mine, ohhh 

You won't see a tear - 
It's only raindrops 
I'll conceal my fear - 
Until the pain stops 
Hold me in your arms - 
Just one last time, ohhh.... 

I'll try not to cry - 
as I say goodbye to you 
I'll try not to cry - 
coz I cannot hide the truth 
I'll try not to cry - 
as I say goodbye to you - 
it's so hard to tell you - 
it's so hard to tell you - 
now it's farewell
