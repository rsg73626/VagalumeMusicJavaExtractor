FIRST STEPS

I wasn’t looking for love but then again I’ve been single long enough When I saw you my heart jumped out You really stood out from the crowd 

Tell me I’m not dreaming did you see him I’m going to marry that man Build a little house and a little garden See our babies running around 

Sometimes it happens Love at first side We can make it happen tonight 

First steps are slow In your mind you’ll never know But your heart says just go In love you’ll risk it all 

I feel a little uneasy I know my eyes are a give away Boy don’t tease me Look at me don’t look away 

Tell me I’m not dreaming did you see him I’m going to marry that man Build a little house and a little garden See our babies running around 

Sometimes it happens Love at first side We can make it happen tonight 

First steps are slow In your mind you’ll never know But your heart says just go In love you’ll risk it all
