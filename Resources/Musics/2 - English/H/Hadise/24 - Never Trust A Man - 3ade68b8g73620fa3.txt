NEVER TRUST A MAN

Oh don’t temp me now
Cause you really got me blown away with those looks you’ve thrown
No I ain’t here alone
So you really gotta go away before I’m weak to the bone

So tell me whatcha gonna do
You should think it over now before you make that move
So player whatcha gotta say
Ain’t a kind of player here for a role in the hay
So player whatcha gonna do?

I could never trust a man
With his tail up in his hands
If you got it don’t be slick
If you’re cool don’t rub it in thick

I could never trust a man
Don’t wanna get hurt again
If you got it don’t be slick
If you’re cool don’t rub it in thick

Oh just let me know
Tell me when you’re done talking all about yourself
So I’ve gotta go
Your smoothy booty talk ain’t never gonna open my shel
So player whatcha gonna do?

I could never trust a man
With his tail up in his hands
If you got it don’t be slick
If you’re cool don’t rub it in thick

No oh oh oh...
So tell me, whatcha gonna do
So player, whatca gonna do
So tell me

Baby you don’t wanna be all over my thing
Tell me what you know about the real passion
Maybe you’ll please me like the whole night long
Then you’ll take off when you’re gonna get none

Tomorrow I don’t want to be a fling of the past
Don’t wanna get to know you, but a lovin’ that lasts
Maybe you think you can treat me some bone
But I’m not a dog, I’m a kitty that purrs

I could never trust a man
With his tail up in his hands
If you got it don’t be slick
If you’re cool don’t rub it in thick

I can never trust a man x3

My stomack can’t tickle tonight
I ain’t up for a fickle ride
My stomack can’t tickle tonight
I ain’t up for a fickle ride
