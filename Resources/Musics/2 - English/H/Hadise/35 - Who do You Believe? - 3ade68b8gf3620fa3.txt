WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?

Who do you believe
Lyrics written by Yves Jongen
Music written and composed by Yves Jongen


When you both tried you both lied
To make your own right

You both tried to crucify me
Trying to keep me out of sight

Now it’s for real, I’ve been stolen
From my own sense

If I had your mouth
If I was so loud
I wouldn’t lose my own friends

I know how you can change the truth
I know how you can sell a lie
I know how you can feel no pain
I know how you are skin dry

Who do you believe x3

Now it’s for real, I’ve been stolen
From my own sense

If I had your mouth
If I was so loud
I wouldn’t lose my own friends

Who do you believe
Who’s telling the truth
Who do you believe
Who’s telling the truth
