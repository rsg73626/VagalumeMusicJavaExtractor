LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS

I keep a picture of you everywhere I go It’s like my lucky charm everywhere I go When I can’t reach you on my cellphone When I’m feeling like I’m all alone 

Day after day it’s not easy Day after day I keep busy 

Long distance relationships I’m a 1000 miles away from my baby’s cheeks And I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy Got to hear your voice before I got to sleep I want to hear you talk, want to hear you breath I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy 

If I could bridge the gab everywhere I go If you’d be there with me everywhere I go When I leave you my heart goes numb When you didn’t call my mind is gone 

Day after day it’s not easy Day after day I keep busy 

Long distance relationships I’m a 1000 miles away from my baby’s cheeks And I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy Got to hear your voice before I got to sleep I want to hear you talk, want to hear you breath I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy
