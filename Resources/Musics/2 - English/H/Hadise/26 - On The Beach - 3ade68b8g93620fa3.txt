ON THE BEACH

The sun is shining
On the sea
Heaven isn’t far from here
Got some friends
Here with me
Dozing off yeah

On the beach
Its so hot I’m not getting up yall
Chilling out lie about
On the beach
Just a little cool breeze on my skin
I’m off into dreamland all day


Lazy, laidback down on the beach
Oh yeah oh yeah
Here everybody’s living carefree
Oh yeah oh yeah
Tell me what more do you need
When ya lazy laidback down on the beach

What we do is close
To nothing
Just staring at the sky
And breathing it in
My hand in the sand
Getting a tain
I’m so loving it

On the beach
Its so hot I’m not getting up yall
Chilling out lie about
On the beach
Just a little cool breeze on my skin
I’m off into dreamland all day
