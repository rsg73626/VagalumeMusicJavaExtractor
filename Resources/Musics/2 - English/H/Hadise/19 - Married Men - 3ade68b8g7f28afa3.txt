MARRIED MEN

Never touch a married man No matter when it’s a dead end Never touch a married man You’re not his wife not the way you think You’re his secret until she finds out And she will… 

Never never never never Never mess with a married man 

Girl don’t sweat for a man like that Don’t do it girl Don’t do it girl Don’t use your breath for a man like that Don’t do it girl Don’t do it girl 

Look in his eyes he ain’t mister right Night after night he’s making you blind 

He will leave you…He will leave you girl 

It’s the truth It’s the truth It’s the truth …
