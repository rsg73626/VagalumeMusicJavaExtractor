AIN'T DOING IT RIGHT

Zip your thoughts for a while
Stop thinking where you head
Cause there’s no shortcut to my bed
Don’t lean back with a sigh
Just get into the romance of thing
Let’s take it easy for a while

It never feels right when the timing is wrong
Cause i don’t need attention with intention

Don’t grow sex on my face
Go slow if this is your pace
You ain’t doing it right

Don’t throw sex on my face
Oh no time ain’t a waist
If you’re doing it right


Your eyes keep wondering of
Your mouth hasn’t spoken enough
You’ve quenched my lust
With your flapping tongue

Wait a while before you....go there
Let’s take it easy for a while

Don’t grow sex on my face
Go slow if this is your pace
You ain’t doing it right

Don’t throw sex on my face
Oh no time ain’t a waist
If you’re doing it right
