APOCALYPSE

Private Apocalypse
No more tears
Apocalypse
Are you afraid

Devils dance their psychotic waltz
By the sound of your pumping heart
Your daemons rape your angels
Your apocalypse can start

Like poison through your veins
You are starving

You're heaving for your breath
Satisfy your need
Oohh face the hollow eyes of death
Private apocalypse
Tranquillised and numb

Thorns are growing
Through your soul
A deathlike silence
Just before the storm

All things angelic
Left for hate
Apocalypse.
Your undeniable fate

Devils dance their psychotic waltz
Your heart is pumping faster

Private apocalypse
Face the seven sins
The devils always win
Private apocalypse
No more tears to cry
Apocalypse
Are you afraid to die
