AN OATH SWORN IN BJORGVIN

when the grimson red skies
baths the horizon in a poisonous kiss
I kiss my hammer
I kiss my sword
my eyes glear of infernal joy

in my dreams I saw them
they made me swear the oath
at the seventh of the seven mountains
the twenty first of december

the skies bath the horizon in fire
I hold my sword before me and I
kneel before the blood on the stone greet me!!!

this moment was chosen at the birth of the gods
a true son of aasgard I am
my sign is the color of the night
and the blood that ran on my fathers graves!!!

the oath is sworn the blood is given
now I await you to pass me your forces
