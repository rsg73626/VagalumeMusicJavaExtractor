DREAM TRAVELLER

RISE!!
high above the crystal sea
the lake of fools

FLY!!
fly on the wings of your soul
invoke the daemon that dwells at the core of your soul
the beast of your spirit
gaze through the eye of the beast you have become
through the twisted gates of the infinite

FEEL!!
feel the force you posses
touch the stars
sail the silver starshine
in the warship of your mind
the spirit world, the astral crown
your power has no bound
"Rosepetals. thrown before my feet by the angels
Lillies.. thrown before my feet
by the black ones, fallen from grace"

DANCE!
dance in the dreams of the dying

PRAY!
pray in the dreams of the dead
you are one with the mist of the universe
one with the essence of all
ride the dragon. ride the dragon
through the tangled web of the mysteries
of the human mind
