CARNIVAL BLASPHEME

Come gather now to this humble feast
I host this hallow night
come join the masquerade
attend the pleasure and delight
come drink the sweetest wine I serve
directly from its source
entangle in pure decadence
engage this carnal waltz
(I do insist)
tempting fruit of lust desire
piles before my purple throne
come taste the flesh and scented fumes
present your flesh and bid your juice
(I trust theirs plenty)
daughters, bitches-virgin whores
and sons of saints and daemons
rejoice in carnal lust,-infernal and divine
This funeral of morals on this very holy night
ecstacy and blasphemy
profound and true delight
lotus drugged erotica; ooh cum for me my brides
take it higher, burn like fire
pain voluptuary desire
ecstacy extreme
attend the orgy carnival blaspheme
