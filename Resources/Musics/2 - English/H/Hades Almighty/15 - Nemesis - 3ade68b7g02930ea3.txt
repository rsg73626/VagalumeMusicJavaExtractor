NEMESIS

Lashed to your knees by a serpents tongue
forced to eat the lies
Jehovah. messiah.
the bloodstained sword shall crush your heart
the wild blood of a beast runs through the vains.
even of a newborn child
the blood is ancient
and so is the spirit withinenlighted times.
the values of the brave and the values of the valuable
are spoken with contempt
but when the heads are bowed to kiss the feet of Christ
decay and blindness remain as the only truth
.of those who are slaves
lost paths of a realm so long denied
lost ways of warriors pride
drown in the well of madness you creature
which sin is resection of thy nature
for you are a predator!
and the dispute of such a fact is mockery of your existence
oohh nemesis be thy name you sweet revenge
