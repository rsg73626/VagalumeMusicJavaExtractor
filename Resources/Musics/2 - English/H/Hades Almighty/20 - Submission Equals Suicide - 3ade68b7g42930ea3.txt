SUBMISSION EQUALS SUICIDE

When the hunger
Slit your mind apart
And you hind yourself
Strangled by the crown of thorns
You crave.your soul is bleeding
You throttle in a lake
Of lunacy and decay
You grasp for your fear
Cadged by mediocrasy
The morals of the "high lords" is for the damned
Is for the DAMNED!!

Go for the chaos
Go for the kill
Bow for the bloodlust
"Do what thou wilt"

Love your addiction
To this drug, that I call life
Play the games of desire
Thrust and twist the knife

So push it harder
Drive it faster
Realise that you're the master
Beneath the cross you fools can hide
Submission equals suicide
Submission equals suicide
Submission equals suicide
Submission equals suicide.

Go for the chaos
Go for the kill
Bow for the bloodlust
"Do what thou wilt"

Go for the chaos
Go for the kill
Bow for the bloodlust
"Do what thou wilt"

Submission equals suicide
Submission equals suicide
Submission equals suicide
Submission equals suicide.
