THE AWAKENING OF KINGS

this is the dusk of the week!
northern storms are silent,
yet it blows in the north
northern kings are sleeping,
yet kings rule

ten centuries of torment
of a northern soul
but soon the hammer shall strike
this is the dusk of the week
the dawn of an age of... strength!

oh'hail the mighty kingdom
that from the ruins shall arise
oh'hail the mighty kingdom
beneath the midnight skies
northern storms are no longer silent
northern kings do no longer sleep
oh'hail the mighty kingdom
