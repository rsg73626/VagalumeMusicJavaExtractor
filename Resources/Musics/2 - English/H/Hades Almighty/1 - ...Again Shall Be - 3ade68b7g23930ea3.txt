...AGAIN SHALL BE

darkness entombs us, as we watch the mountains before
waiting for the silent wind to bring us the
sign of the ancient horn

the bells shall chime as the towers burn
in flames of eternal hate
burn in the name of the elder faith

black ravens of war raise your unholy banner
again the smell of blood shall drift
under the silver moon

chant your song on northern glory
blow your horns for northern pride
sing those songs so long forgotten
hail those ravens that once died
