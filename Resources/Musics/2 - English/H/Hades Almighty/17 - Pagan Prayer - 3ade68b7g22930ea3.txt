PAGAN PRAYER

over the cold endless
mountain streem
into the dark frozen forest
under the snow coverd trees
through the wintery
whispering winds
great gods of Esgerd
guide us through the night
let your ravens fly

lead us through valleys
great gods of valhalla
guide us through woods
great gods of valhalla
let your valkyres fly
and let us enter
let us enter thy hall

over the cold endless
mountain streem
into the dark frozen forest
under the snowcoverd trees
through the wintery
whispering winds
great gods of Esgerd
guide us through the night
let your ravens fly
