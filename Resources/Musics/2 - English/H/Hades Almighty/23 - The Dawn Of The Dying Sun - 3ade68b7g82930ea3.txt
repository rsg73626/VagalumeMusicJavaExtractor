THE DAWN OF THE DYING SUN

a massive lust-like rage I feel
yet calm, rejoiced, I am
the so lifegiving daylight went
then night, so pure, became
with the shining, ancient, moon
so cold and twilight grey

thou shalt see no tomorrow come

beware the future misery
read the shadows as they pass
a freezing wind a promise bring
the dawn of the dying sun

chaos dwelling secretly
ten centuaries of night... eternal!
earth turns to a frozen stone
all things shall end
yet thorns shall grow
throughout the dust of death

bringer of chaos be greeted!
harvest your souls from your chariot of ice

beware the future misery
it is written in the night
an eclipsing wind, a promise brings
the dawn of the dying sun

a massive lust-like rage I feel
yet calm, rejoiced, I am
the so life-giving daylight went
then night, so pure, became
with the shining, ancient, moon
so cold and twilight grey
it is the dawn ofthe dying sun!!!
