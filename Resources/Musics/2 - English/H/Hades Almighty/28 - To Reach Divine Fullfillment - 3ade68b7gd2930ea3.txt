TO REACH DIVINE FULLFILLMENT

Free my spirit from the flesh
free my soul from the mediocre state of mortality
I shall dance with the ravens that circle the sky
between dream and death through eternity
my soul shall journey through the void of twilight
realms by night with the crow I shall fly
bringing words to the elders of those
who will live and who will die
I will dance and feast
among satyrs and shadows of lust and desire
I will rise up high to the midst of the stars
and blaze through dimensions in the chariot of Mars
I will dine among djinns in Lucifer's hall
and come as bid when the demon queen calls
.aahhh what pleasure
unchain me from this cage of time and of space
release my soul from the mediocre state
nectar and poison, mist and bright rays
I know this is my ultimate fate
free my soul, I long to reach divine fullfillment
free my soul, I long to reach divine fullfillment
