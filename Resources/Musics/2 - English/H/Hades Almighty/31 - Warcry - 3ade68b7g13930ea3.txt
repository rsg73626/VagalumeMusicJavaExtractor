WARCRY

Heathen warcry
I summon the strength of the gods
warcry!
my soul is free to become possessed
and new reward shall be given
as we ride
under the...
black moon
cold moon
full moon
I grant you my sacrifice
as my enemies fall as a harvest
by the sound of my..
warcry!
thundering hooves breaks the ground
warcry!
firstblood is drawn
a scent in the wind
to be aroused by death is no sin
the savage rage in our eyes
as our enemies die
scattered destruction, the chant of the horde
the Goddess of death gides my sword
midwinter moon, pale light shine
this baptism of blood
is all but mine
