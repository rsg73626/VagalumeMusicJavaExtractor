RAZOR

Only the crows
Fly at night
Viewing the desolation
Only the crows
Cry at night.
And the victims of my desecration

My time is at night
When I hear the crows cry

And you are so afraid my sweet
Cause you know you shall die
I caress your skin
OHH. it's my high

A thin-lined pattern
Red on white
My art. my passion and the crows at night
You twist and tangle
From my cold steel touch.
From a RAZOR!!

Only the crows.
Fly at night
