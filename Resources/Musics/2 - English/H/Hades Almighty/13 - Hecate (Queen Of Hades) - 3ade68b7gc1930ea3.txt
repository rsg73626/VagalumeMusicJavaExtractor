HECATE (QUEEN OF HADES)

hellish, earthly and heavenly
goddess of the crossroads; guiding light
queen of the night, enemy of the sun

friend and companion of darkness
you who rejoice to see blood flow
ou who wander amidst in the hour of darkness

thirsty for blood and terror of mortals
gorgo
mormo
moon of a thousand shifting forms
