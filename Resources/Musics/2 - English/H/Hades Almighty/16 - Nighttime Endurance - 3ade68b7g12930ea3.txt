NIGHTTIME ENDURANCE

.Ohh mistress of emotions
night in twilight rays of grey
in your embrace alone I find endurance
the fragile hours set between the sundown and the dawn
the beauty of the dawn
so sinister yet calm
stagnant I stand as I give in to you
reverence
fading light in a crimson glow
soon the moon its rays will throw
through the torn up blackened sky
it's a sinery
so vast before me lie
birth of night before my eyes
I shiver as the sunlight dies
a tarn, black mirror shine
reflects the innerself of mine
listen to the night sounds
howling hunters wind through trees
the beauty of this song
is almost painful
a requiem... a moonchant
like a mournful
threnody...
an anthem to the night
soon to reach its height
as I join to cry out
all my sorrows
embraced by night alone
I find endurance
the silence of the witchinghour
like nectar to my soul
alas, this beauty can not last forever
or praytell
it will do when
I die
