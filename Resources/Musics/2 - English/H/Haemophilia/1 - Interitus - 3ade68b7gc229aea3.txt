INTERITUS

Hark! The bones and the bounds are broken. Feel! The solitude is one with you now... Vows falls into endless oblivion. Seek, and you will witness death...
Profane devotion, sinful decree. Blasphemous vengeance, satanic devotee!

Bow! This punishment becomes you all. Affliction, all-embracing epitaph... Myths and the paralysing light of doubt is gone... No holy sacraments can save you now!

Morti-fer - Infernus - Dominus - Ave Satan!
I am your plague, one with black decease... Advocate of hellish supremacy. Cursed and banished in prideful blasphemy! For oaths and promises consumes by me!

Profane devotion, sinful decree. Blasphemous vengeance, satanic devotee!

Morti-fer - Infernus - Dominus - Ave Satan!
