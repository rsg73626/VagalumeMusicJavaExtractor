CRYIN OUT MY HEART TO YOU

[Verse 1:]
I'm Standing Here I'm Half Way Dead
I'm Like A Child With No Family
I'm Helpless(Ooh, Ummmm)
Knowing Girl I've Done U Wrong
Please Forgive Me
I've Been So Much A Fool
Please, Girl, I Love U
I Couldn't Take It
When U Said Farewell
My Heart Bled So Crazy
Lady, I'm Sorry
In The Early Mornin
I Woke Up Knowin
U Aren't There By My Side
I've Lost U

[Chorus:]
Cryin Out
Cryin Out My Heart 2 U
Cryin Out
Cryin Out My Heart 2 U
Cryin Out
Cryin Out My Heart 2 U
Cryin Out
Cryin Out My Heart 2 U

[Verse 2:]
Now The Tables Turned On Me
I Felt The Way U Felt Baby
I'm Hurtin(Yeah)
And Now I'm The One That's Wearin Yo Shoes
Being The One That's Singin Oh The Damn Blues
Yall Know What I'm Sing, Sang It
I Know I Was Wrong, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah [x3]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
U Must Beware Of
What U Getcha Self Into
Cuz Somebody Else Might Do It Just 2 U
Yeah, Yeah

[Guitar Interlude and Dino Singing]

[Dino Singin:]
U Ain't Got 2 Go Nowhere Baby
U Ain't Got 2 Go Nowhere Baby
Say If U Need Somebody 2 Cook Yo Breakfast
I'll Be Right There
It Will Be Me
It Will Be Baby, Yeah, Yeah
I'll Play The Keyboards 4 Ya
