VISIONS IN MY MIND

Oh... yeah... say yeah... ooo... check it out listen...

[Verse 1:]
Beatin on our woman
Never exist to life
Who's head in charge
Depends on skills not rights
Beiing all she can be
Never been touched in the army
And stoppin sexual harassment
That comes so frequently

[Chorus:]
Woman finds new Aids cure to life
Presidents, she is for mankind
Visin in my mind vision in my mind
Vision in my mind vision in my mind

[Verse 2:]
Seeing people walk together
But not separated at all
Because one feels that the other
Is not big but small
Living in an equal world
Colors don't matter at all
Stop having the po po's
Rodney kinging us down

[Chorus:]
Vision in my mind
Woman can prevail
Presidents she is for the new world
D-o-g's be gone to hell
Vision in my mind vision in my mind
Vision in my mind vision in my mind
Vision in my mind (woman presidents coming woman save our children)
Vision in my mind (woman rule the world yeah) whoa oh oh

[Talking:]
See we been doin this to our woman too long (too long) yeah (said dino) we got to stop it ya'll... I said it's so wrong in world today... never seen a woman as president... never seen a woman hold down the things that man always rule I gotta see it all vision in my mind vision in my mind vision in my mind visions in my mind
