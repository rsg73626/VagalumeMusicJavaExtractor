THE DAY I DIE

This is how I feel on that ending day of my life yet I am not afraid so I want you to enjoy my eternal vision
Verse 1 16 chariots I'm the one that carries me away filled with the people that I love while death embails me away 6 paul barers burnin' in a suit white in gloves on the hands to salute 7 ministers to pray me a prayer for the ones Ive treated unfair mama dear by my side while I go to the grave the one to come and say that I gave this will be fine on that day on that day that I die 
I want the dickon on that day I want my mama to love and say I want my mama to stand right by my side while I take that heavenly ride I want Dino, Shazam, GI and be by by my side while I go to the grave I want the little ones to stand beside me I want every one to know that Im gon be fine one that day I die
