LICK YOU UP

Stop 
Let's 
Take this real slow
Let me break it down so that you can know
I'll do things 
You never imagined me to do
I'll lick you all over 
As the sweat 
Pours down on you

Girl I want 
To lick you up and then down
Come on and let me do 
What I can do
Come on 
And tell me what you need 
Cause I just want to 
Taste the sweetness 
From your body
Let me

Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down
Come on let me lick you around
And then
You will feel my fire let me lick

Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down
It'll be right
It'll be right
Come on

Every 
Little touch 
That I make 
Will be so nice girl
You know what I'm gonna do
Lady, lady, lady, lady
First I'll start from your toes 
And then I'll make my way to your thighs
I'll make you so wet that you will never let 
Me go

How all about
Go Shazam

These are the things 
That will make you 
Feel so right
Oh oh oh oh oh all night
