THEY LIKE IT SLOW

Like it slow
Like it slow (slow)
Like it slow
Like it slow

Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go
Like it slow

Don't you know they like it slow
Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go
Like it slow
Don't you know they like it slow

I can feel your touch
Everytime you move back with your push
And it feels so wet
Then I get my slow motion right there
(ooooohh I wanna love your body slow)
Everytime I count a punch
And the rules go always slow toe to toe
If you don't know they don't like that right attack, 
damn right

Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go

Like it slow
Don't you know they like it slow
Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go
Like it slow
And I drive upon this far more
Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go
Like it slow
Don't you know they like it slow
Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go

come Don't, 
Ones that do there cetain to get none
And it don't justify
Don't try to move to fast take your time
It's a bad thing to come and drive straight by
Trying to be the one to win your trust
'Cause they don't know (yeah baby)
How you feel for sure
So take it slow
It's alright
I did dodge it

Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go
Like it slow (I like it)
Don't you know they like it slow
Like it slow
Humpin' fast that ain't gon' go
Like it slow
And I drive upon this far more
Like it slow
said body knocking so slow
Like it slow
But don't you know they like it slow
Like it slow
Lets break it down oh no (slow)
Baby let me take it slow with you

Slow it down take time right
Go fast girl (no) makes me pull from (no)
Won't you take your time
Won't you take your time
Won't you take your time (take your time)
Won't you take your time
I like it
Won't you take your time (take your time)
Won't you take your time
Won't you take your time
Sing it again sing
Break it down
I like it
Sing it to them

Fade
