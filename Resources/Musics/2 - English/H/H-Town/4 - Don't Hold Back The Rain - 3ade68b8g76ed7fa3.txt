[Verse 1:]
Fuss and fight till the early morn
Then you stole on me as I try to calm you down (no no no)
As I layed face to face with you
I kno I noticed that you don't want me to
Tell you right now I say

[Chorus:]
Rain is fallin down (I want a divorce right now say)
Rain is fallin down (I can't go thru it say)
Let the rain come fallin (I'm a call the police)
Let the rain come fallin (I ain't gon hit chu)
Fightin cats and dogs (I said I want to be gone)
