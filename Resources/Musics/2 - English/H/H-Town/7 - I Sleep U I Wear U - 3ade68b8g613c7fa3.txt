[Chorus:]
I do I do I do
Yes I yes I do do
I do say I do
Sleep you every night
I do I do yes I do y'all I do
Say I do wear you night and day

[Verse 1:]
Everytime I go into a daze
I think of you and your sexy ways
I think of all the times that we shared together
Day and night all I sleep is you
Girl I really love the things you do
You and me we a perfect pair forever

[Chorus:]
Said I do I do I do
Yes I do
Sleep you
I do it do it do it
Say I do I do I do

[Verse 2:]
I can't sleep at night
Cause you just keep running through my mind
Baby let me rub your body down I don't mind
Babygirl just keep on loving me
Cause girl I don't feel oh no shame
I wanna be a part of you for life no game by by my baby

[Chorus:]
I do I do I do
Sleep you yes I do
I do I do I do
