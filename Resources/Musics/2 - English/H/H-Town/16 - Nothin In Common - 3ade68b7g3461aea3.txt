NOTHIN IN COMMON

Chorus(2x)
It's not the same no more
yes, we had our days
I dont wanna play no more
say, we have nothing in common

when i first saw you 
you blew my mind the finnest thing in sight
Super woman, superstitions, infactuation just cant be right
Had a walk that cast a manuasl look
and sho' nough caught my eye
on a scale from one to ten the classy body i cant deny
And i felt a passion from your lips it's sweet soft and saucy hot
