WOMAN'S ANTHEM

Yeah... yeah baby it's your anthem
Say yeah yeah yeah ooo oh yeah

[Verse 1:]
Said I'm sorry for what we've done so many years
Said that we've being doing it
Say being fools so many days of our lives
Listen say
Some of us don't mean to do it
I can admit I was wrong
Yeah I'll say
Said I'm apologizing for stupidness
Apologizing for unequal rights
Apologizing for d-o-g's
That's why I want you to listen while I say it

[Chorus:]
Said I'm so sorry for what we have done to you
Said I'm so sorry for what we have done to you
For being d-o-g's [x3]
For all of our lives [x3]

[Verse 2:]
See I remember the days when man was doin things
Like leaving they woman at home to go out to see another woman and maybe another man too
Sometimes it get rough in your life and we never act like we're there we don't even act like we care
Say I'm apologizing for 1992 for 1993 cause that was part of me
And nothing else I can see
But baby I'm apologizing for all you dogs
I'm apologizing for when we (didn't come home)
I'm apologizing for when we (every abuse)
I'm apologizing for when we listen ladies your anthem

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Sorry for the mornings and the night (not coming home)
Sorry for puttin my hands on you that wasn't right (yeah)
Sorry for running out when we made life
But we can renew it we can renew it oh today
Said I'm so sorry for what we have done to you...

Why would we do such a thing for being alone
Break it down play it dino...
