ALL ALONG

I can't believe my ears
Yeah, how you'd ever found out
Those were the lies that came out of your mouth
I've been crying way too long
Lying here without you
So tonight
Tonight

I'm never gonna go back
I'm never gonna go back to you
Alright
Alright
I'll give it up and go back
Give up and go back to you

She cries herself to sleep at night
And no one's there to dry her eyes
And you know it won't be me
You know it won't be me
Tonight

Never did I know I would try to take your life
That's the truth
Never did I know that you would take my heart
And break it in two
But you did and I wish you well
Because I can't hold out forever
But I'm glad you did
And now it's better off this way

[*1*]
Open up your arms tonight
You know you really want to let me in your heart tonight
You wanna let me on in
You know I would love to help

She cries herself to sleep at night
And no one's there to dry her eyes
She knows it won't be me
You know it won't be me
Tonight

Every time you're crying
Or think of dying
I hope you're thinkin' of me
Every time I bleed
I like to think of how we would be

But does it matter because you left me now
'Cause I can't hold out forever
But I'm glad that you did
And now it's better off this way

(REPEAT [*1*])

Tonight
Tonight
I'm never gonna go back
I'm never gonna go back to you
Alright
Alright
I'll give it up and go back
Give up and go back to you

She cries herself to sleep at night
And no one's there to dry her tears
You know it won't be me
She knows it won't be me

Take things for granted
She leaves me alone
Broken and bruised
I'm waiting by the phone now
Alone now
I'm home now
I still lie all alone
I still lie all alone
I still lie all a...

I see your eyes
Don't look down now
You try to talk but the words won't...
Come on now
I know you missed me all along
I know you missed me all a...

I see your eyes
Don't look down now
I try to talk but the words won't come out loud

I know you missed me all along
All along...

I see your eyes
Don't look down now
You try to talk but the words won't come around
I know you missed me all along
All along

I see your eyes
Don't look down now
I try to talk but the words won't come around
I know you missed me all along
All along

I see your eyes
Don't look down now
You try to talk but the words won't...
Come on now
I know you missed me all along

You see my eyes
I won't look down now
I'll try to talk but the words won't...
Come on now
I know
I missed you all along

All along
