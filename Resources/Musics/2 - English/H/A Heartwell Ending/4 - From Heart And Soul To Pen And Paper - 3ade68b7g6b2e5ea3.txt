FROM HEART AND SOUL TO PEN AND PAPER

All these bottled up emotions swell inside my head
Feelings never felt before makes me wonder
Makes me wonder why?
Why I'm even here I'll try
Got to find a way outside
But nothing seems to open

So go, go away so I can't see 
You near me
Near enough so I feel safe inside
Fly away, I hope you understand me
But I know you never will

The leaves are blowing restlessly those leaves upon my yard
Whispering the melody makes me wonder
Makes me wonder why? 
Why I'm even here I'll try
Got to find a way outside 
But nothing seems to open

So go, go away so I can't see 
You near me
Near enough so I feel safe inside 
Fly away, I hope you understand me 
But I know you never will
I know you never will

Don’t leave me here 
While I'm waiting right here on your porch

She stays quiet while they riot
Broken bones there’s nothing like it
Lights a flashin people dashin 
As they’re runnin from the crime scene
Was it fatal? Will she make it? 
Her lifeless body lies there naked 
Will she make it? Will she make it? 
God I hope she’s fine 

So go, go away so I cant see 
You near me 
Near enough so I feel safe inside
Fly away, I hope you understand me 
But I know you never will
I know you never will
