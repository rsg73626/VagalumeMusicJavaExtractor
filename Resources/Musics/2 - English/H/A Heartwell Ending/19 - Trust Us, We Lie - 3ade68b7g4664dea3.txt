TRUST US, WE LIE

I know I'm not the reason she's been sleeping in so late she's not a whore
although I may be the reason for deep breathing caused her pants to hit the floor
I see a little bit of me inside of you
so I hate you hate you
despite that fact i'll try 
to make you love me
then you'll leave me
thought you'll see me so deprived
from love i'll feed you lies tonight

What was the point of leaving me behind
What was the reason that you see him
then you call me on the phone at night
When you were all alone despite that

I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
she sleeps wit one eye opened 
so she'll see me down the hall
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing

She takes advantage of my shyness
though my kindness is just an act
that I will rarely ever display
she leaves a message for me
like she could ever compete with new girl
it's not you girl

what was the point of leaving me behind you
what was the reason that you see him
then you call me on the phone at night
when you were all alone despite that

I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
she sleeps wit one eye opened 
so she'll see me down the hall
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing

open your window cause here i come now
your so distracting it could kill
your so distracting 
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
she sleeps wit one eye opened 
so she'll see me down the hall
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
