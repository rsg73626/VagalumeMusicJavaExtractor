SECRETS (IN BETWEEN THE SHEETS)

So this is how it feels to feel for that last time,
So maybe not so maybe not like the first time,
So much like that one time you know that one time I made you scream my name,
Believe me the pain subsides when it rains outside
I swear there screaming from the words that you said is this the,
Way it should be is this the way it should be.


[Chorus/Coro:]
She's screaming at the top of her lungs
Love it or leave it I kept the secret to myself
Between the sheets its stayed it never came out my mouth,
I know its not what I was told in the first place,
I know its not what I was told in the first place.


Just know I'm the best thing despite what your friends think,
Despite what your friends think, I was the best thing,
Kissing you was a contradiction,
feeling confined and so much worse,
Even if it didn't mean a thing to you,
you meant the world to me, you mean the world to me.

[Chorus/Coro:]
Love it or leave it I kept
Between the sheets its stayed it never came out my mouth,
I know its not what I was told in the first place,
I know its not what I was told in the first place.

Take everything I once gave you,
And throw it away, throw it away,
She seems so perfect until she fades away,
Though everything's happened she wont let it get in her way,
Tonight's the night tired of thinking tired of drinking never sleeps,
a wink at night it's time to give in,
it's half passed seven lay down baby close your eyes.
