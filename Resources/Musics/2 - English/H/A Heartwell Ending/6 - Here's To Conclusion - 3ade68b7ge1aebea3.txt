HERE'S TO CONCLUSION

So this is how it feels to feel for the last time, 
so maybe not so maybe not like the first time, 
So much like that one time you know that one time i made you scream my name 
Believe me the pain subsides 
when it rains outside 
i swear they're crying from the words that you said 
Is this the way it should be, 
is this the way it should be, 
shes screaming at the top of her lungs 

love it or leave i kept the secret to myself 
between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth 
i know its not what i was told in the first place i know its not what i was told in the first place 
love it or leave i kept the secret to myself 
between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth 
i know its not what i was told in the first place i know its not what i was told in the first place 

Just know Im the best thing 
well Despite what your friends think 
Despite what your friends think 
just know im the best thing

kissing you was a contradiction. feeling confined hurt so much worse 
even if it didnt mean a thing to you it meant the world to me you mean the world to 

love it or leave i kept the secret to myself 
between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth 
i know its not what i was told in the first place i know its not what i was told in the first place 
love it or leave i kept the secret to myself 
between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth 
i know its not what i was told in the first place i know its not what i was told in the first place
