TWO R'S ARE BETTER THAN ONE

Any little bit any little bit bit could help
raise your voice come on come on and scream it out
take another little piece go ahead and rip it out
slowly sipping from the drink he bought her
she left her makeup stain on his collar
all his friends told him not to bother
but everything is going right tonight
i know no rhyme no reason lies keep teasin 
kisses make up smears her eyes
she's starin at me, she stairs so sadly
she keeps pretending she's alright
can you hear me breathing quiet tongiht
thought you hope for the worst 
moving in for the kiss
why you turning away you want this
can you see me fading out of the light
every bit of it hurts
everyone of her words
she sems so sweet so useless
hanging from the rooftops by her fingertips
she's barely holding on
slow serene and quiet
i say we try it i say we be what she would want
any little bit any little bit bit could help
raise your voice come on come on and rip it out
can you hear me breathing quiet tonight
thought you hope for the worst moving in for the kiss
why you turning away you want this
can you see me fading out of the light
every bit of it hurts
everyone of her words
she seems so sweet so useless
do you know what i thought when i first say you
do you know what i thought when i thought that
i say you ying with him
you always told me you'd be faithful
you always told me you'd be true
you always acted, you always acted different with me with me
