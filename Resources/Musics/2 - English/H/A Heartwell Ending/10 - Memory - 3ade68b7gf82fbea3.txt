MEMORY

Shes got me lookin' past the sight 
of all of her sober directions fading. 
Retrace your footsteps, their baiting 
part of me for the ones that are the same. 

Now that you see that I'm on your mind. 
Now that you realize you got no time. 
But you give it up, 
give it up, 
give it up baby, without this, its no fun for me. 

I'm trying not to think about before, 
the way before the night time. 
I like that. 
Girl just like that. 
You would like that. 
You blow my mind. 
You blow my mind. 

(Write about you tonight, I don't think these words will work, they make no sense.) 
(Write about you tonight, I just can't comprehend just what I said.) 
She's the one that I hold in my heart. 
I'm her memory. 
I'm her memory. 
(Write about you tonight, I don't think these words work, they make no sense.) 
(Write about you tonight, but I just can't) 
She's the one that I hold in my heart. 
I'm her memory. 
I'm her memory. 
(Remember just what I said to you.) 

Tonight I, I like that, I write that, I'm right beside... 
I know that you notice. 
I don't even want to know. 
Cause I don't even really care. 
But I was right there all the time. 

Give it up baby; without this, its no fun for me. 

I'm trying not to think about before, 
the way before the nighttime. 
I like that. 
Girl just like that. 
You would like that. 
You blow my mind. 

(Write about you tonight, I don't think these words will work, they make no sense.) 
(Write about you tonight, I just can't comprehend just what I said.) 
She's the one that I hold in my heart. 
I'm her memory. 
I'm her memory. 
(Write about you tonight, I don't think these words work, they make no sense.) 
(Write about you tonight, but I just can't) 
She's the one that I hold in my heart. 
I'm her memory. 
I'm her memory. 
(Remember just what I said to you.) 

Oh my god. 
Look at, now she's done it again. 
She's done the same to me 
that she did to all her friends. 
She told 'em then to leave me dead, 
and didn't even give time to tend. 
The same looks meant inside my heart, 
I know you were never my friend. 

I know that I will never breath again. 
I told you the same. 
I know i'm not. 
Because I lied. 
Before I knew what you were. 

(Write about you tonight, I don't think these words will work, they make no sense.) 
(Write about you tonight, I just can't comprehend just what I said.) 
She's the one that I hold in my heart. 
I'm her memory. 
I'm her memory. 
(Write about you tonight, I don't think these words will work, they make no sense.) 
(Write about you tonight, but I just can't) 
She's the one that I hold in my heart. 
I'm her memory. 
I'm her memory. 
(Remember just what I said to you.)
