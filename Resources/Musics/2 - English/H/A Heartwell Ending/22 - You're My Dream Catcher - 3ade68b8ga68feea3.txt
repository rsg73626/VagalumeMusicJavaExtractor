YOU'RE MY DREAM CATCHER

You feel the poison in your veins
Just know its form the needles that we shared
So stop pretending your afraid
You never ever close your eyes in the first place
So don't you tell me that I must be crazy
Look in the mirror can you see my face
Hear her cry by my side
I didn't think we would last this time
I'll try despite the lies
Keep pretending like everything's alright
Can you feel the pain
It's breaking, it's breaking me apart
Despite what we envisioned since my vision 
It's been blurred since the start
So don't you tell me that I must be crazy
Look in the mirror can you see my face
Hear her cry by my side
Didn't think we would last this time
I'll try despite the lies
Keep pretending like everything's alright
He sees her cry, he tries to dry her eye before the tear drops
She turned her back despite the words he told her
She's on his mind despite the time despite the price that it cost
He gave away more, more than she paid for.
Somehow my heart is still intact
Despite the seeds I've sewn
Your sent infect my sheets and
The sires sing so slow
So callous show no impact
So far from all I've known
Please tell my baby i'll be back
Baby I'll be back
Hear her cry by my side
Didn't think it would last this time
I'll try despite the lies
Keep pretending like everything's alright
He sees her cry, he tries to dry her eye before the tear drops
She turned her back despite the words he told her
She's on his mind despite the time despite the price that it cost
He gave away more, more than she paid for.
