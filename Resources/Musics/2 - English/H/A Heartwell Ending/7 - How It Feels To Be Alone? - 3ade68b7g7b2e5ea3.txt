HOW IT FEELS TO BE ALONE?

I’m alone
I'm tired 
And I’m breathing to hard to my get
I'm on my own
I'm lonely 
I'm weightless
I'm breathing 
And I can't keep casting for this death
My heart is a bursting and everyone inside
Keeps on asking me what I’m gonna to do with my life and I say 

Well, we're going to die
We're gonna live
We're gonna try
Raise the blades will never kill this kind of cancer
But I saw you in the light while waiting for me with a knife
If you want me, baby, here I am. 

I’m alone
I'm tired 
And I’m breathing to hard to my get 
I'm on my own
I'm lonely 
I'm weightless
I'm breathing 
And I can't keep casting for this death
Here I keep on going
My eyes just never close
Eeverything is asking me "Do you know what is goes in"??? 
And I say 

Well, we're gonna die 
We're gonna live
We're gonna try
Raise the blades will never kill this kind of cancer
But I saw you in the light while waiting for me with a knife
If you want me, baby, here I am

Well I’m not gonna die 
We're gonna live
We're going to try
Cuz raise the blades would never kill this kind of cancer
So I saw you in the light while waiting for me with a knife
Well if you want me, if you want me
