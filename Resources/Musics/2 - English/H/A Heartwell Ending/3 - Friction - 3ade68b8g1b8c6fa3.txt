FRICTION

Searching for something 
Don’t know what it is 
Constantly searching for what 
Finally it’s brilliant 
To easy for me 
Maybe someday I’ll open my eyes 

Staring at the ceiling again 
Staring at the ceiling again 
Tearing, tearing on your picture again 
(Off the wall) 
Tearing, tearing on your picture again 
(Off the wall) 
Staring, Staring at the ceiling again 

Losing your temper 
When things don’t go your way 
Maybe this is what you needed 
Losing your title 
All that was so clear 
Maybe it’s time you realized 

Staring at the ceiling again 
Staring at the ceiling again 
Tearing, tearing on your picture again 
(Off the wall) 
Tearing, tearing on your picture again 
(Off the wall) 
Staring, Staring at the ceiling again 

Tearing down your picture 
Tearing down your picture 
Tearing down your picture again x2
