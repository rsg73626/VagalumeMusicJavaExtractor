PRELUDE TO KILL

I'm waking up on her side of the bed today
I know it's not the same, the same as yesterday 
But everybody wants to love
But everybody wants to love
Another knife in my back 
Another letter unopened 
Another lie in her cubbard that she's hiding away 
All these questions I ask 
New excuses you give me 
I've had it up to here 

Tell me you're bleeding 
Tell me you need him 
Tell me anything, but lies 
Don't waste your time on me
I'm long gone, I can see it in your eyes
Tell me you're bleeding 
Tell me you need him 
Tell me anything, but lies 
Don't waste your time on me 
I'm long gone, I'm long gone, I'm long gone

The fire in her eyes was burning bright 
She said, she said, she was through with me 
Never expected it to come to this 
She got me, got me down on my knees

Another knife in my back 
Another letter unopened 
Another lie in her cubbard that she's hiding away 
All the questions I ask 
These lame excuses you give me 
I've had it up to here 

Tell me you're bleeding 
Tell me you need him 
Tell me anything, but lies 
Don't waste your time on me 
I'm long gone, I can see it in your eyes 
Tell me you're bleeding 
Tell me you need him 
Tell me anything, but lies 
Don't waste your time on me 
I'm long gone, I'm long gone, I'm long gone 

I love the way you looked inside your red dress 
Love the way you looked in your red dress 
Why you go and do this to me? (3x)

Love the way you looked inside your red dress 
Love the way you looked
Love the way you looked 
Love the way you looked 

I will love you more than
They could ever try, 'cause I 

Love the way you look inside your red dress 
Love the way you look in your red dress 
Why did you do this to me?
