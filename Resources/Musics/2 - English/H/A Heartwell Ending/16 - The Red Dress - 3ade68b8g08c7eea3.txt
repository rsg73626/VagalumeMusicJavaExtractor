THE RED DRESS

I'm waking up on your side of the bed today,
I know its not the same the same as yesterday,
But everybody wants to love, everybody wants to love,
Another knife in my back another letter unopened,
Another life in the cupboard that your hiding away,
All these questions you ask these lame excuses you give me,
I've had it up to here,

Tell me your bleeding, tell me you need him,
Tell me anything but lies,
Don't waste your time on me I'm long gone,
I can see it in your eyes,
Tell me your bleeding, tell me you need him,
Tell me anything but lies,
Don't waste your time on me I'm long gone,

The fire in her eyes was burning bright,
She said she said she was through with me,
Never expected it to come to this,
She got me down on my knees,

I love the way you looked inside your red dress,
Loved the way you looked inside your red dress,
why did you do this,
Tell me your secrets tell me tell me tell me your thoughts,
Tell me your secrets everything's alright,
Tell me your secrets tell me tell me tell me your thoughts,
Tell me your secrets everything is,
I loved the way you looked inside your red dress,
Loved the way you looked in your red dress,
Why did you do this to me?
