THERE'S TWO 'R'S IN SORRY BUT ONLY ONE 'R' IN WHORE

Any little bit any little bit
Big and how
Raise your voice come on come on and scream it out
Take another little piece, go ahead and rip it out

Slowly sipping from the drink he bought her
Half the make up sitting on his collar
All his friends told him not to bother but everything is going right tonight. 

No rhyme no reason
Lies keep teasing
Kisses make up smears her eyes
Keeps staring at me 
Stands besides me
Keeps pretending she’s alright. 

Can you have me be the quiet tonight
Why you hoping the words
Going in for the kiss
Why you turning away
You want this

Can you see me fading out in the light?
Every bit of the hurt
Everyone one of the words she sings so sweet so useless

Hanging from the rooftop by her finger tips
Barely holding on
Self serving and quiet
I say we try it
I say we be what she would want

Any little bit any little bit
Big and how
Raise your voice come on come on and scream it out
Take another little piece, go ahead and rip it out

Can you have me be the quiet tonight
Why you hoping the words
Going in for the kiss
Why you turning away
You want this

Can you see me fading out in the light?
Every bit of the hurt
Everyone one of the words she sings so sweet so useless

Do you know what I thought when I thought that I saw you?
Are you with him?
Do you know what I thought when I thought that I saw you?
Are you with him?
Do you know what I thought when I thought that I saw you?
Are you with him?
Do you know what I thought when I thought that I saw you?
Are you with him?
Are you with him?
Are you with him?
Are you with him?
Are you with…

You always told me you’d be faithful 
You always told me you’d be true 
You always told me you’d be true
You always told me you’d be true 
You always acted
You always acted different with me
With me…
