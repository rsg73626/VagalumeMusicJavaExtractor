REALIZATIONS A BITCH

God your face is so persuasive

Lets just face this because I can barely even hold on never thought that I'd be here for long

So baby why don't you live it up live it up live it up now slit your wrists baby maybe like your losing control live it up live it up another let down until you weep and see what I've been trying to get across to you
Got the cold shoulder never meant to hold her as we got older realized all she ever did was lie to me I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along the one that wiped your eyes and told you you were perfect when you're not

Live it up live it up live it up now slit your wrist baby maybe like you're losing control live it up live it up another let down until you weep and see what I've been trying to get across to you (until you weep and see and what I've been trying to get across to you) until you weep and see what I've been trying to get across to you

Got the cold shoulder never meant to hold her as we got older realized all she ever did was lie to me I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along the one that lied too you and told you you were perfect 
You're not perfect (you're not perfect) you're not worth it (you're not worth it) you're not perfect you know baby you're not worth it not at all.
