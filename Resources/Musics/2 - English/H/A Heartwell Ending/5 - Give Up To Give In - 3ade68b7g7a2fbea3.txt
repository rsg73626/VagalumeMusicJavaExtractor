GIVE UP TO GIVE IN

Why I know everything changes tonight 
Why though, does everything get me 
Tonight I'll be waiting, tonight I'll be looking 
I'm taking my chances 
I'm running with everything that i get from you 
That I got from you 

She screams she screams my name at night 
(She screams she screams my name at night) 
She screams she screams my name at night 
She's oh so sexual 

I'd rather rather give up then give in 
I'd rather rather give up then leave it all behind 

I see it in your face 
I see right through your disguises 
Just know I'll never be the one to run and hide 
One more little lie out of that mouth 
I'll be the last one 
To pretend to, to talk to, to befriend you in the end 
I know that I'll be there 
So tell me who's fooling who, tell me who fooling who in the end. 

She screams she screams my name at night 
(She screams she screams my name at night) 
She screams she screams my name at night 
She's oh so sexual 

She got her fist clamped tight and her feet on the ground 
She got her lips sewn shut she's not making a sound 

I'd rather rather give up then give in 
I'd rather rather give up then give in 

Speed it up speed it up girl your moving so slow for me 
So casually don't you see 
Your never gonna catch me at that speed 
Your moving in way to slow 
I know everything changes tonight why though... 

She screams she screams my name at night 
(She screams she screams my name at night) 
She screams she screams my name at night 
She's oh so sexual 

She got her fist clamped tight and her feet on the ground 
She got her lips sewn shut she's not making a sound 

I'd rather rather give up then give in 
I'd rather rather give up then give in 

One more minute to keep the record spinning i need this 
We need this please don't let me go 
One more minute to keep the record spinning i need this 
We need this please don't let me go 

She screams she screams my name at night 
(She screams she screams my name at night) 
She screams she screams my name at night 
She's oh so sexual 

Come on give me your hips 
Come on give me your lips 
I wanna pull you in so tight 
Compe
