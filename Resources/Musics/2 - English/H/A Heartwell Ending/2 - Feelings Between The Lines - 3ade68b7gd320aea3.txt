FEELINGS BETWEEN THE LINES

you were my poison
you were my biggest mistake
nothing worth knowing
thot u were real but ur fake
you seemed so flawless
with every breathe that youd take
i wish that i could just breath you in tonite

so whats the difference
sweetie your like night and day
i know im worth more
this burning postpones the pain
i see you walk by
theres nothing more i can say
we have no future so i breathe you in tonight

go ahead and run from your problems
these tracks will always lead me right back into the vein
flick the metal now its time that we solve them
heres to not feeling as i become unconcious again
go ahead and run from your problems
these tracks will always lead me right back into the vein
flick the metal now its time we solve them
heres to not feeling so ill breath you in tonite

you made me feel things that i never thot possible
you made me see some things i never thot probable
caused an addiction self infliction of pain its true
all side effects aside i wish i wish i wish that i
i wish that i could just take it back tonite

come take a chance on me and breathe it in tonite
now its too late theres nothing left but still i breathe you in tonite
