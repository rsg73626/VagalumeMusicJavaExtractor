IF LOOKS COULD KILL

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer 
Maybe just a whore, maybe you're a ...
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
Maybe just a whore ... 

Maybe just a whore! 

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer 
Maybe just a whore
I promised so much more
Walking through that door became a job
If looks could kill
If looks could kill 

I'm sorry for, I'm sorry for, I'm sorry for 
Bleeding on your porch
I know, I know, I know 
Knew that it wasn't right 
But of course I tried 
To keep my heart inside of my 
Chest but that fell through 
That's why I'm here with her not you 

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
Maybe just a whore
I promised so much more
Walking through that door became a job 
(If looks could kill) 
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer 
(If looks could kill) 
Maybe just a whore
I promised so much more 
Walking through that door became a job 

It's a comfort to know 
That you're watching them go 
Watch your living scream you're name 
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you needed?
Is this what you call our bleeding kids?
Take a run for me, leave them all alone 
See their eyes when their love's so far from home 
With a flick of the tongue 
And the shake in the hips 
And the look in your eye 
And the red of your lips

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
Maybe just a whore
I promised so much more
Walking through that door became a job
If looks could kill 
If looks could kill 
If looks could kill 

I'm sorry for, I'm sorry for, I'm sorry for 
Bleeding on your porch 
I know, I know, I know 
Knew that it wasn't right 
But of course I tried 
To keep my heart inside of my 
Chest but that fell through 
Well, that's why that's why I'm here with you 
Here with you 

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
Maybe just a whore 

If looks could kill 
If looks could, if looks could 
You'd be a whore 

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
Maybe just a whore
I promised so much more
Walking through that door became a job
If looks could kill 
If looks could kill 

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
Maybe just a whore
Maybe I'm the 
Maybe I'm the murderer 
Maybe you're the whore 

If looks could kill 
If looks could, if looks could kill 
You'd be a murderer 
If looks could kill 
You'd be a murderer
