FLOE

We did it y'all, Ravipops
I'm here, emphatically yes
Definitive Jux, Ravipops

Ladies and gentlemen
We got C-Rayz Walz and a million fans in the house tonight
He just came off tour
Reppin for his 25th single
See "Ravipops - The Substance"
He gon' show you how he get down

[C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, I put the pace down, recognize my fate now
I'm ILL, still freakin skills like H-Town
I disgrace clowns who make frowns
Smile in your face but hate and deliver fake pounds
I'm a animal, in a cannibal sector
With chicks that give you brains like Hannibal Lector
Peep logic - there's nothin you can do to stop this
You have a better chance catchin bullets with chopsticks (WAHH!)
Wait for the avalance - then you'll get down
Spit rounds, my sitcom's a full clip now
Murder shows, practiced and unrehearsed, dead on point
Like a convertible cactus hearse
It's mucus fluid, when I spit exclusive music
I believe in dirt, SO I DO IT STUPID
I move units, like {?} and white rose
My freestyle's ill - I'M DOPE WHEN I WRITE FLOWS

Put the sun in your face, make you walk a tightrope - and pose
I can't just rhyme, I can flow
F-f-flow, flow f-flow, f-f-flow, flow

[C-Rayz Walz]
I do somersaults with Silly Sally in Silicone Alley
Roll red carpets in darkness through Death Valley
and receive love (love) like Larry
I'm flowin black - it's September? Goin back to Cali
To drink booze in the House of Blues
Doin the JAMES, in Elvis Presley shoes
From the belly of BK, where the drama's at
All the way to Saudi Arabia - where the llamas at
Trapped in central bookings - for a chronic sack
Feelin worse; I'm really here, for killin a verse
Homicide comes to ask "Who did it?"
I step to the next +Iron Galaxy+ like astral physics
I'm spiked with no sugar, natural image
Thirst is nothin, burst you for frontin at the scrimmage
Vampires suck, you stuck once bitten
Off the head I'm fed, my freestyle eats my written
I need that dollar like Chris Rock - just kiddin
I'm down to earth like sunlight, and alien visits
In the club with {?}, guzzlin water
Trainin my daughter to be a soldier, I taught her
to put six in your chest - like Julius Earving
Controllin the cypher, you foolishly swervin
I deserve to glow and now you know
AIYYO, I can't just rhyme, I can flow

Flow flow, flow {*repeat 3X*}

Flow...
