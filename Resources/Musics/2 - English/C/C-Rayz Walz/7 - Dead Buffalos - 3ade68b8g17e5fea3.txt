DEAD BUFFALOS

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz] 
I see dead buffalos, on the plains of the horizon 
Electromagnetic energy fields like M. Bison 
Through the air flyin, like black crows in a circle 
Before the people of the land start dyin 
Nature's siren, even the rivers won't act right 
The full moon was a flashlight, in my past life 
When traveling the winding path at night 
Unraveling the blinding blasting site 
Chickens come home to roost and find dead buzzards 
Layin next to the head of cousins, sisters and brothers 
Fathers and mothers, daughters and sons 
Only the vultures profit, I could still see the blood run 
The slaughter of loved ones, hated for bein different 
Elders were slain, strangled with their talismans 
Killed the body, the spirit started driftin 
Destroyed physically, but the souls were ever livin 

[Chorus] 
Thank you! For takin my land and food 
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose 
Thank you! For killin my seed 
Givin me disease, then blamin me - thank you! 

Thank you! For takin my land and food 
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose 
Thank you! For killin my seed 
Givin me disease, and then blamin me - thank you! 

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz] 
I took my shahada (one) and gazed in the drama 
God against the devils, Shaolin versus Lama 
We fought felons, clashed with Magellan 
Baby heads were crushed and bust like small melons 
Wishin these demons would be baptized or banished 
In my dream I woke up in Jamaica speakin Spanish 
The night the earth cried when the good ship arrived 
Blood on the shores transformed to Crimson Tide 
I built with Crazy Horse, made a black sun spack 
The smoke shack was beat on by drum back stack 
The beetles were baffled, by the state of bondage 
Showin love like Pocahontas savin John Smith 
Convinced by the truth of the past, since the body splash 
Used the Atlantic as a skeleton raft 
Unafraid, I went to a cave to meditate 
And talk to my celestial mind and elevate 

[Chorus] 
Thank you! For takin my land and food 
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose 
Thank you! For killin my seed 
Givin me disease, then blamin me - thank you! 

Thank you! For takin my land and food 
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose 
Thank you! For killin my seed 
Givin me disease, and then blamin me - thank you! 

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz] 
The land was raped, scorn, torn and withered 
Later on you would praise portraits of these killers (cheese!) 
Even made holidays for this unholy act (Happy Thanksgiving) 
I'm the voice of the dead! You can't hold me back (no!) 
Dead buffalos, similar to us now 
In the name of gain on these plains we get bust down 
What up, HOW, you think there be reparations? 
We been touched down, so make preparations (now) 
Under water holdin breath I dodge piranha fish 
With fright, wishin to die was tomorrow's wish 
I heard the mountain weep, skulls smash against clif with sticks 
We clash with the madmen, from the good ship 
We did nothing but show love to a stranger 
We were repaid with murder, rape and anger 
Buffalos died, the lions would hide, the bears cried 
Savagely speakin the pain of the tribe 
This reality was actually the worst dream 
The death of nature, I heard the earth scream 
Dead buffalos - empty rivers and streams 
Dead buffalos - too many killers and thieves 

[Chorus] 
Thank you! For takin my land and food 
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose 
Thank you! For killin my seed 
Givin me disease, then blamin me - thank you! 

Thank you! For takin my land and food 
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose 
Thank you! For killin my seed 
Givin me disease, and then blamin me - thank you!
