PROTECT MY FAMILY

[C-Rayz Walz]
I'ma protect my family, that's my word
My wife, child, my dogs, cat and my birds
I got a happy house home, you can't disturb
You might clapped in the dome, clap, not you herb
I'm walkin these dogs, puttin in work, got the coroner locked
C'mon dogs don't be a jerk, and have to bark at the glock
My brother got his spot down the whole, a hop skip and a cold
I'm from the old school fam, I don't lock my door
Ain't no more arguin, negative screamin and fightin
All that's gonna do is leave the little residents frightened
I bring home groceries, pack bags, stack cash
Stay gracious, use patience, don't get mad
And I'ma be the dad my father couldn't be cause he died
One of the many reason I've cried, could it be {?}
I take Bacardi shots, cause the youth is illin
But I'm +Ravipops+, that's my excuse for livin
Forgivin myself, for not learnin a trade in school
Now my eyes stay red like I just came out the pool
I want my son to learn to build write and read from me
And not have cocaine plans with weed money

[Chorus x2]
I'ma protect my family, that's my word
Livin on the corner left that life on the curb
I'ma protect my family, that's my word
(No need to get around I got that good stuff at home)

[Killa Kal]
I'ma protect my fam, is what this jam be about
My sons, my daughter, and definitely my spouse
Cause when the goin got tough, she got rough, no doubt
All you chickenheads cluckin, break out
Since July 4th 1993 there's been a change in me
My baby boy Khalil, made a man of me
Made daddy think, to stop hustlin in these streets
Make daddy think, would I live to see my son reach 3
Even though, daddy didn't have a daddy there
Daddy's gonna make sure, you never have a care in this world
Now I got a baby girl
Born a day after my birthday, Lena changed my world
And put my life, into a proper perspective
And now respectin women is my only objective
See, I used to treat women real bad
And now I feel bad because my baby girl could get had

[Chorus]

[interlude]
Yo, I'm not tryin to die in the street
But, my people need somethin to eat
And, I'm just tryin to feed my fam
Straight up, I need cash in hand

[C-Rayz Walz]
Protect my family, my political statement
When it's time to get foul, my whole style's flagrant
When my little girl cries, it's a thunderstorm
Beacuse of, raw talent, my son was born
They say God made man (when) man made God
(Then) man made child with no job, life's hard
Hard men try to be men, steal and rob
Damn, man with no plan behind steel bars and guards
Now the next man's doin it right, doin ya wife
Doin ya son's homework, man he's doin ya life
You ruined your plight, it coulda been a walk in the park
Or a talk in the dark, now it's a union of stripes
I'm like protect your family, no matter who you are
It all comes down, to the sun moon and stars
If you know these degrees then you knowledge me pah
If you think it's all a joke well hardy, hardy har
