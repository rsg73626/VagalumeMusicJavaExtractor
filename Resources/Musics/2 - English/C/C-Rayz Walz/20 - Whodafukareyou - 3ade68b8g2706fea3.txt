WHODAFUKAREYOU

* Fuck alarm clocks, battle me you'll start wakin up
I slice you with your rhyme book and write verses on your paper cuts
With alcohol pads, excuses you'll be makin up
Sound dumb like Outkast breakin up
Last time you shot somebody, you had a camera
I'm C - Rayz author of stamina

Loungin on the walls you'll end up like Humpty Dumpty
With your shell cracked, scrambled, in search of something
I'm a narcisist, I bomb quick, your full of shit like sausages, pardon this
I alone turn crews into the Partridge kids
I love games I play you like bragin right cartridges

Y'all against me is dragons versus ostriches
Totally proposturous, like abortions, i kill stupid kids before they act up
Make a new suit flip call it a black tux
You cracked up like baseheads in a space ship
Playin ??? in the matrix, the only thing i lose is my patience
I smack the shit out you tissue heads
????? ????? ??????
Hip Hop Don deep into stocks and bonds
I'll take a shit in your house, and blame it on your moms
Survivin the game when i get money im buyin a chain
Drivin a Range and my flame will expire your fame
I'm comin through loaded one, buckin two 
I'm C-Rayz Walz son who da fuck are you?

Chorus: (X2)
Ayo yo yo im truckin through with my ruckus crew, your luck is through
Yo im C-Rayz Walz WhoDaFuckAreYou?
I'm comin through fifth knuckle bruise brick fist snuffin you
Yo im C-Rayz Walz WhoDaFuckAreYou?
