SOONER THAN NOW

(verse 1)

where are my friends?
the ones who will be in the end
you broke my heart this time
staring at me reading your lines

(chorus)

bye my regrets, the things i said to you that night
we'll be just fine x 2

(verse 2)

sooner than now
you pushed me farther
and i'll wait for my mother
spinning, playing out

(chorus)

she's spinning, playing out

(chorus)

take my will away
i'll bleed myself today
we'll be just fine x 4
