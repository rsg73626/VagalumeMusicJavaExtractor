PILLBOX

(verse 1)
i've made it this far
a brand new year
another birthday gone
my shallow hearted friend

(chorus)
it's all in this pill box
these words for you
a song for my friend
something so brand new

(verse 2)
kerosene burns up still
your star shines bright
its on your shoulder
the one to the right

(chorus)

we can go for a drive x 2
just soothe me x 3
just

(chorus)

i'm not afraid anymore, ill just let you drive x 2
soothe me
