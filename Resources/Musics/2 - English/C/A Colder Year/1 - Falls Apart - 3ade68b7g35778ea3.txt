FALLS APART

Where did we go wrong this time?
Did I say something that you didnt like?
We've been over this a thousand times
I would take it back if it could change your mind

(chorus)
I guess it doesnt matter
I dont mean a thing to you
Will it feel the same when it falls apart?


Right before you go
Let me tell you
that I dont care anymore
Walk out the door
No wait dont leave me

chorus 5x
