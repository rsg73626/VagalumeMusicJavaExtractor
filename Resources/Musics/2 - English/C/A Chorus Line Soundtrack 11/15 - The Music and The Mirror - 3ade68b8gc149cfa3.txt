THE MUSIC AND THE MIRROR

Give me somebody to dance for Give me somebody to show.
Let me wake up in the morning to find I have somewhere exciting to go.
To have something that I can believe in To have someone to be.
Use me, choose me, God, I'm a dancer, A dancer dances!
Give me somebody to dance with. Give me a place to fit in
Help me return to the world of living By showing me how to begin.
Play me the music, Give a chance to come through.
All I ever needed was the music And the mirror and a chance to dance for you.
Give me a job and you instantly Get me involved
If you give me a job Then the rest of the crap will get solved.
Put me to work, you would think That by now I'm allowed .
I'll do you proud.
Throw me a rope to grab on to, Help me to prove that I'm strong.
Give me the chance to look forward to sayin'
"Hey, listen they're playin' my song."
Play me the music Give me a chance to come through
All I ever needed was the music and the mirror And a chance to dance
Play me the music! Play me the music! Play me the music!
Give me a chance to come through
All I ever needed was the music and the mirror And a chance to dance for you
