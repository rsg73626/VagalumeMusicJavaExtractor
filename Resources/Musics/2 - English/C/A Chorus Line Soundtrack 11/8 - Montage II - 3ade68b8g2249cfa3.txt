[BOBBY]
If Troy Donahue can ne a movie star,
Then I could be a movie star.

[JUDY]
But the thing that made my Daddy laugh so much
Was when I used to jump and dance around the living room...

[MAGGIE]
Please take this message
To Mother from me.

Carry it with you
Across the blue sea.
"Mother, oh, Mother,
Wherever I go
Your Maggie is missin' you so."

"Mother, oh, Mother,
Wherever I go
Your Maggie is missin' you so."

[AL]
Dad would take Mom to Roseland.
She'd come home with her shoes on her hand.

[DIANA]
Mama fat,
Always in the kitchen cooking all the time.

[SHEILA]
Darling, I can tell you now,
Your father went through life with an open fly.

[VAL]
Tits! Where are my tits?

[CASSIE]
Listen to your mother.

Because they're special.

You take after your father's side of the family,
The ugly side.

Early to bed,
Early to rise.

A diaphragm, a diaphragm.
I thought a diaphragm was up
Here,
Where you breathe.

'Til you're

Prom,
I stayed home.

[MAGGIE]
Life is a ashtray.

[VAL]
Shit.
Made it through High School
Without
Growing tits.

[CHORUS]
...Doubt,
To break out
It's a mess.

[RICHIE]
My trouble is wine, women, and
Song.
I can't get any of 'em.

Time to grow,
Time to go,
A-do...

Medical School,

And you're dropping out to be a
Chorus boy.
Nothing!

Somebody.

Locket,
