I CAN DO THAT

I'm watchin' Sis go pit-a-pat
Said, I can do that I can do that.
Knew ev'ry step right off the bat, Said, I can do that I can do that
One morning Sis won't go to dance class I grabbed her shoes
And tights and all But my foot's too small
So, I stuffed her shoes with extra socks, Run seven blocks In nothin' flat,
Hell, I can do that I can do that
I got to class and had it made, And so I stayed The rest of my life
All thanks to Sis (Now married and fat) I can do this.
That I can do I can do that.
