SING!

See, I really couldn't sing I could never really sing What I couldn't do was... - Sing!
I have trouble with the... -
Note!
It goes all around my... -
Throat!
It's a terrifying... -
Thing!
See, I really couldn't hear Which note was lower or was... -
Higher!
Which is why I disappear If someone says, "Let's start a... -
Choir!"
Hey, when I begin to... -
Shriek!
It's a across between I... -
Squeak!
And a quiver or I... -
Moan!
It's a little like a... -
Croak!
Or the record player... -
Broke!
What it doesn't have is... -
Tone!

Ding-a-ling

Three blind mice... Three blind mice... It isn't intentional! -
She's doing her best -
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle bells, Jingle bells It really blows my mind -
She gets depressed
But what I lack in pitch I sure make up in... -
Power
And all my friends Say I am perfect for the shower
Still, I'm terrific at a... -
Dance!
Guys are comin' in their... -
Pants!
I'm a birdie on the... -
Wing!
But when I begin to... -

Goin' 'pong' instead of... - '
