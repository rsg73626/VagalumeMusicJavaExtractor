NOTHING

I'm so excited because I'm gonna go to the High School of Performing Arts, I mean I was dying to be a serious actress. Anyway, it's our first day acting class and we're in the auditorium and the teacher, Mr. Karp, puts us upon the stage with our legs around everybody, one in back of the other, and he says: "Okay, we're gonna do improvisations...Now, you're on a bobsled and it's snowing out and it's cold... Okay, go!"
Ev'ryday for a week we would try to feel the motion,
Feel the motion down the hill.
Ev'ry day for a week we would try to hear the wind rush
Hear the wind rush, feel the chill
And I dug right down to the bottom of my soul To see what I had inside.
Yes, I dug right down to the bottom of my soul And I tried, I tried!
And everybody goin' "Woosh... woosh ... I feel the snow, I feel the cold,
I feel the air..." And Mr. Karp turns to me and he says: "Okay, Morales, what did you feel?"
And I said... "Nothing, I'm feeling nothing,"
And he says "Nothing could get a girl transferred."
They all felt something, but I felt nothing
Except the feelin' that this bullshit was absurd!
But I said to myself, "Hey, it's only the first week. Maybe it's genetic, They don't have bobsleds in San Juan!"
Second week, more advanced, And we had to be a table, Be a sportscar, Ice-cream cone.
Mister Karp, he would say, "Very good, except Morales.
Try, Morales, all alone."
And I dug right down to the bottom of my soul To see how an ice cream felt... Yes, I dug right down to the bottom of my soul And I tried to melt!
The kids yelled, "Nothing!" They called me "Nothing"
And Karp allowed it, which really makes me burn.
They were so helpful, they called me "Hopeless",
Until I really didn't know where else to turn.
And Karp kept
