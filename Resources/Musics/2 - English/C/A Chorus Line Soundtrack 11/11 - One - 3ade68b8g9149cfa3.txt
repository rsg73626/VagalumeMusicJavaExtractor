ONE

All:
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes.
One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes.
One smile and suddenly nobody else will do.
You know you'll never be lonely with you know who.

Girls:
She walks into a room
And you know
She's un-
Commonly rare, very unique,
Peripatetic, poetic and chic.

Girls:
She walks into a room
And you know from her...
Maddening pose, effortless whirl,
She's the special girl.

Boys:
Stroll-ing,
Can't, help,
All of her qualities... extol-ling.
Loaded with charisma is my
Jauntily sauntering, ambling shambler.

All:
(One)She walks into a room
And you know you must
Shuffle along, join the parade.
She's the quintessence of making the grade.
For the guy is second best.(This is whatcha call, Trav-ling)
To none,(Oh, strut your stuff!)
Son.(Can't get enough)
Ooooh! Sigh! Give him your attention.
Do...I...really have to mention?
She's the One?

All:
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes.
One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes.
One smile and suddenly nobody else will do;
You know you'll never be lonely with you know who.

All:
One moment in his presence
And you can forget the rest.
For the guy is second best
To none,
Son.
Ooooh! Sigh! Give him your attention.
Do...I...really have to mention?
She's the... One?
