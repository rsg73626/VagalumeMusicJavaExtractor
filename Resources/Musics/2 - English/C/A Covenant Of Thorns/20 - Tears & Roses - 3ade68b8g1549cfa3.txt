TEARS & ROSES

You live alone
In your little corner of this lost world
I remember your name
Though I doubt you remember mine
We watched the sky shed its color
From blue to black
I remember the deafening roar
Of the wind through the trees

Your powder white face
And black lined sunken eyes
Remind me of the days
When we laughed for hours
My hand in yours
As the lightning lit an empty sky
My hand in yours

Your powder white face
And black lined sunken eyes
Remind me of the days
When we laughed for hours
My hand in yours
As the lightning lit an empty sky
Empty promises forgotten dreams and tears

The afternoon shadows stretch
Through your bedroom window sill
And down the hall
To the room where I sleep each night
Waiting alone
In silence for you to return
Waiting alone

The afternoon shadows stretch
Through your bedroom window sill
And down the hall
To the room where I sleep each night
Waiting alone
In silence for you to return
Hidden fears false comfort and tears

I stand in the corner of your room
As you walk away
Down the same hall
To the room that was never mine
The tears fall as the roses wilt away
Wilt away with tears
