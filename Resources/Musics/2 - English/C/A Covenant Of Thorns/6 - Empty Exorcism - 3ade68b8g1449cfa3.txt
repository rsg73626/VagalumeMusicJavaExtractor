EMPTY EXORCISM

The empty spaces filled
The cradle's torn and the bow breaks over head
Tears fall like rain
The body's young, but the mind is year ahead

Leather on skin
Your eyes are open, but they're clouded with rage
The gear grinds down hard
You're driving sober, but your mind spins out of control

Yeah, You can never touch me now
Yeah, You can never hurt me now
