CROWN OF THORNS

I've made my decisions
But this is not what I had envisioned
I've followed my heart
But my truest intentions always fell apart
Nothing speaks like blackened souls
Sometimes I'm so afraid
To think that for all eternity
I'll have to sleep in the bed I've made

I've tried to stay sane
But my past always catches up again
I've followed the path within
But it always seems to lead back to sin
Nothing speaks like a lover's kiss
Sometimes I fall to pleasure
Knowing that in the end
The punishment is too large to measure

Bow down. It's what you want
Bow down. It's what you need

And I know I've let you down
My shame and remorse scorn
And I'll be forever destined
To wear my crown of thorns

I've tried to trust
But my thought always return to lust
I've tried to be pure
But my feelings have never been so sure
Nothing speaks like eternal shame
Sometimes I falter
Head bowed down asking for forgiveness
At the foot of fate's alter
