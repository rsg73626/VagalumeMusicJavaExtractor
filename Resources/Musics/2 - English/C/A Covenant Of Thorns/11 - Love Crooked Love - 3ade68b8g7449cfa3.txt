LOVE CROOKED LOVE

My heart beats out of time
With the constant pounding in my head
Fear, heartless fear
It pulls me away from my dying dreams of
Love, evil love
A constant craving to be heard
Time, wretched time
Has stolen away the only things I've ever held dear

I have never known love
I have wanted you all this time

And every time I try
I'm diving harder towards the ground
Oh, I think I can fly
But my heart has spun me upside-down
Love, crooked love
It drives a stake into the soul
Pain, precious pain
It's caused by those that we are the closest to

And I don't need your sympathy
To find my way
And all I've ever struggled for
Was love, crooked love

I have never known love
I have wanted you all this time
I have never know love
To be anything but a lie
I've hated you all my life
