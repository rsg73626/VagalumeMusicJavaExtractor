DRIVE ME HOME

Your first breath was your last
And you're trying to stand on your own
The whole of your life has been so unkind

You bury it down deep inside
An unholy reminder of pain
Like a shard of glass within your soul

And I believe
That there was something deeper that you didn't show
An unspoken fear
That you felt you had to hold on to
And I believe
That there was something darker that you didn't let on
And in the end
You were running from yourself

Can you hear me calling you
From beyond
Will you drive me home
I'm feeling very numb
You can take it all away
But I'll always be your friend
Are you driving in circles
Or are you driving me to my end

You stand at the start
And you're dying to reach the end
Time feels like it's standing still
And you feel so alone
And you're searching for someone the same
But love can only go so far
