BRING YOU UP

Life is so easy we fail
So much harder than death
Start with the right wing use the left
Wings aren't for flying at all

One more race around disaster
Two more hits before the fall
Three fates deciding where you go
Just wishing for a

Wonder Falling
The beauty you have failed to see
Is following you down
And I'm so scared I'll
Write a tragic comedy
Until you turn your life around

Sing a song that ignites us
Don't run away

I'll bring you up
Raise the bottle pass the torch
Look into my heart
Raise your head above the shame

Crash into whatever heals
You know better than I
What it takes to make your heart fall from your sleeve
Inspirations abound
But never tied down too firm
Lease yourself into another epi

So far falling
The beauty you have failed to see
Is following you down
And I'm so scared I'll
Write a tragic harmony
Until you turn your life around

So speak in absolutes
Act only in extremes
