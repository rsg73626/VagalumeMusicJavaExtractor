BREATHE

Don't say goodbye
Is what I begged that night
And every tear you cry is what makes me die
So don't let me die, I won't let you cry tonight.

Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you and me will always be
Take my last breath it's your to keep.

And when I fall from the rooftops above
I'll spread warmth to the ground with my love and my blood
And no one will notice that I'm gone
But deep down inside, I hoped that I was wrong.

Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath its your to keep.

With a gun in her hand shes my shooting star...

Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you and me will always be
Take my last breath it's your to keep.
