GASOLINE SUNSETS

[Chorus:] 
Engulfed in the flames, 
while I'm screaming your name, 
can you hear me this last time? 
Gasoline sunsets, 
wake us from our rest 
as the darkest sky ignites. 

[Verse 2:] 
(Unknown Screaming) 

[Chorus:] 
Engulfed in the flames, 
while I'm screaming your name, 
can you hear me this last time? 
Gasoline sunsets, 
wake us from our rest, 
as the darkest sky ignites. 

[Verse 3:] 
(Unknown Screaming) 

[Bridge:] 
Cross my heart, 
and hope to die, 
with the gasoline sunset lighting up the sky. [x7] 

Cross my heart, 
and hope to die, 
with the gasoline sunset lighting up the sky, 
tonight...
