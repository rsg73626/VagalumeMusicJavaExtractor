LITTLE BY LITTLE

When the love is born
Baby, owner of my heart
Will you still be there ?
When friends break apart
...................... a lonely nights
Oh, you lost the game of love
There's a rainbow in his eyes
And I just can't get enough
'Cause I need your smile
Stronger than before
Drowning in a sea of love
Get up - need you more

Oh, little by little - you can break my heart
Oh, little by little - promise in the dark
Magic touch you gave to me is more than fantasy
Oh, little by little - you can break my heart
Oh, little by little - baby you're so smart
Take me in your heart tonight
My love, my sweet love

Two hearts beat as one - all the days and all the nights
Too young for lies doesn't make it right
Why can't we be friends in the shadow of your love
Someone saves my life 'cCause I need that stuff
Running with the night - running my own way
Drowning in a sea of love
Babe, you make my day
