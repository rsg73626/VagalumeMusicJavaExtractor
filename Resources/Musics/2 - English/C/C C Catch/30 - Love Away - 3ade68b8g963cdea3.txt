LOVE AWAY

I'm missing you, you're far away
What can I do, to give you all my loving
I'll wrap it up, to send to you
So maybe baby, you'll know what to do

I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life
I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life - Oohh, baby

I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
(Will you return someday)

How can you stay, away from my heart
Another day, to give me all your loving
It's been too long, without your touch
So next time baby, it won't be too much

I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life
I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life - Oohh, baby
