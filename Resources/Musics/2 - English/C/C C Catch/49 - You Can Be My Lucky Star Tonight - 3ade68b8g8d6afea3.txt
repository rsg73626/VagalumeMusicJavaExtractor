YOU CAN BE MY LUCKY STAR TONIGHT

Never say never
    When you're young and in love
    Never need anyone
    Are you still dreaming
    Nothing can change when your love is gone
    Be young be foolish tonight
    But never behave like a child

    You can be my lucky star tonight
    Baby, keep the fire burning bright
    If you win this time my heart
    We can make a brand new start
    You can be my lucky star tonight
    Baby, come on take me through the night

    Never say never
    There are times in your life
    You'll be wondering why
    Are you still dreaming
    Now, I give you a reason to start a new try
    How can I live without love
    You are the one I'm dreaming of
