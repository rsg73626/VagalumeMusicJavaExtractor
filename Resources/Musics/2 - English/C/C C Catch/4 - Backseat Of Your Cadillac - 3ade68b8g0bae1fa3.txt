BACKSEAT OF YOUR CADILLAC

What a heart of fool I am
My dreams fade away
Oh I know you are my friend
Feel it stronger every day.
Do you wanna - sentimental lady
Do you wanna - be my baby?
Do you wanna break my heart over and over again?

In the backseat of your Cadillac
Oh baby Oh
You made me mad so mad
In the backseat of your Cadillac
I want to have my feelings back.
Oh kiss me with devotion
All I want is you
Oh kiss you and hold you and touch you baby

What does it take my heart to win back your love?
I'll never tear apart my baby
I'll never get enough.
Do you wanna - sentimental lady
Do you wanna - be my baby?
Do you wanna try my heart over and over again?

Try me
My love
Fly with me
I'm lost in love - give me your emotions
Try me
My love
My love and my heart and my soul
