DON'T SHOOT MY SHERIFF TONIGHT

Met you Tonight, be a man of my love
You're a prince of my enemy
Met you surender I can get enough
Your sweet love souviners
Baby, don't kill me with your heart desire
Together we can shine
Oh can't you see that my heart's on fire?
Oh you don't want, oh baby just be mine

Don't shoot my sheriff tonight
My sheriff tonight
Baby he's the wonder guy
Don't shoot my sheriff tonight
Stand on the fight
He'll be lost in the night
Don't don't don't shoot my
Don't don't don't shoot my
Don't shoot my sheriff tonight
Tututu don't shoot my
Tututu don't shoot him tonight

Hot things in the midnight, in the danger zone
Resitation for lonely hearts
Nobody tough, I can be alone
He belong oh to the dark
Oh I never have a love like fire
Together we can shine
I can feel that you takes me higher
Oh you don't want,  oh baby just be mine
