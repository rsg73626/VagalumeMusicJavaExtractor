SHAKE YOUR HEAD

Shake your head, shake your head
Shake your head, shake your head
( let' s go, let' s go, let' s go to bed )

You can' t argue with death
Can' t break a burly sailor' s neck
You can' t drink lava from plastic glasses
And you can' t influence the masses
You can' t tune a radio to heaven
You can' t live seven lives
You can' t win money at the horses
And you can' t fight the armed forces

Shake your head, shake your head
Shake your head, shake your head ( let' s go to bed )

You can' t sue Buddha for libel
You can' t rewrite the Bible
You can' t hit homers like Babe Ruth
And can' t put your finger on the truth

You can't sing under water
You can't have the boss' daughter
You can't make missles out of mud
And you can't purify bad blood

Shake your head, shake your head
Shake your head, shake your head ( let' s go to bed )

Shake your head, shake your head
Shake your head, shake your head ( let' s go to bed )
