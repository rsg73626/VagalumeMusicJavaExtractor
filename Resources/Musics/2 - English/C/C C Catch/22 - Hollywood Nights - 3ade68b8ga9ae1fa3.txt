HOLLYWOOD NIGHTS

Daytime friends and nighttime fools
Oh, they're breaking golden rules
Dreaming all their dreams come true
Dreaming like the big guys do
From a day in paradise
And a life without a lie
Little dreams can go a long, long way

Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight
Ohoho, ohoho
Hollywood nights
Stop these Hollywood nights
Know that it's right
Ohohoh, ohoho
Hollywood nights

Dreams are more than a little wish
Broken promise's maybe you're reach
There's a will and there's a way
You'll build the pain another day
You can make it, if you try
Don't give it up
Oh baby, why ?
Little dreams can go a long, long way

Hollywood Nights
Stand of the fight
Hollywood Nights
Know that it's right

Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight
Ohoho, ohoho
Hollywood nights
Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Know that it's right
Ohohoh, ohoho
Hollywood nights
