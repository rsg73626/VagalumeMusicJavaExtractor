I CAN LOSE MY HEART TONIGHT

Take, your chance for paradise
    I'm looking in your eyes
    You might be mine tonight
    Yeah, I'm feeling like a fool
    'Cause you still act so cool
    Spend the night with me

    I can lose my heart tonight
    If you're lonely, feel alright
    This is just the night for me and you
    I can lose my heart tonight
    Are you lonely deep inside ?
    There is something in the air tonight

    I can feel it every where
    There's magic in the air
    You might be mine tonight
    Yeah, I feel so hypnotized
    I feel like paradise
    I see heaven in your eyes

    Take me in your arms
    Hold me close tonight
    Take my heart away
    Take me to the night
