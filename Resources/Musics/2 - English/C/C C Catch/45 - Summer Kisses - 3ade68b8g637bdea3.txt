SUMMER KISSES

Stop. Hey man, there's a way
Save me just for a sunny day
Ooh I wanna, yes I want your heart
Choo choo choo

Young hearts are full of pride
And you never see what's deep inside
Ooh I wanna, yes I wanna give my heart to you

S-s-s-s-s-summer kisses
A summer in love
S-s-s-s-s-summer kisses
Ooh I'm dreaming of
S-s-s-s-s-summer kisses
Forever in love
S-s-s-s-s-summer kisses
Ooh I need that stuff

Stop. Hey man, hear me
Give me your love, what's gonna be ?
Ooh I wanna, yes I want your heart
Choo choo choo

Hey you, my words are true
Do you feel my love, oh, like I do ?
Ooh I wanna, yes I wanna
Give my heart to you

Summer kisses love
Ooh-ooh, my heart is true
S-s-summer love
Ooh-ooh, my heart is true
S-s-summer love
Ooh-ooh, my heart is true
S-s-summer love
