MIDNIGHT HOUR

In your midnight hour
When you're alone and lonely
Do you think of him
(Do you think of him)
And in your midnight hour
Can you feel the darkness closing
Does it frighten you
You must learn to hide your feelings baby (baby) 
Baby (baby)
Now he's not there to hold, 
He's always on the run
And you're the lonely one
Face it girl 
You need him in your midnight hour

If he stayed the night
Would it be alright
To have a midnight love affair 
If he held you tight
And he promised you the night
Would you still want him there
(Want you there - baby)
Is it worth the pain (worth the pain)
And would you feel the same
When morning comes
And he's gone (don't go - baby)
And do you really care
As long as he is there
In your midnight hour

In your midnight hour
Do you toss and turn to find him, 
But it's just a dream (yeah, it's just a dream)
And in your midnight hour
Do your thoughts begin to wander
Do you want to scream
'Cause he's not near you when you need him, (baby)
Baby (baby)
Now he's not there to hold, 
He's always on the run
And you're the lonely one
Face it girl 
You need him your midnight hour

If he stayed the night
Would it be alright
To have a midnight love affair
(Don't go - baby)
And do you really care
As long as he is there
In your midnight hour

In your midnight hour
When you're all alone
And you feel like crying
And you lose control
And you start thinking
That it don't make sense
How did you get yourself
Into this fine...fine mess
Now you knew he wasn't perfect
And he wasn't the best
But you still wanted him all over the rest
And although he never promised you
And never said when
You knew in your heart
That he'd be your man

In your midnight hour

If he stayed the night
Would it be alright
To have a midnight love affair 
If he held you tight
And he promised you the night
Would you still want him there
(Want you there - baby)
Is it worth the pain (worth the pain)
And would you feel the same
When morning comes
And he's gone (don't go - baby)
And do you really care
As long as he is there
In your midnight hour
