NIGHT IN AFRICA

Babe, I cry my tears - leaving me is easy
Play that game again and break my heart
Fire in my soul
If you never need me - I'm nobody's child
I'll break apart
Oh, my heart is too young
If you want just your fun
Miss you so deep tonight
Babe, I'm drowning in your eyes

I'm dreaming of a night in Africa
I'm dreaming - you'll never break my heart

Miss you so tonight - don't believe in diamonds
Have a love like this - never before
Never saw the world
Tell me all the ..........
What I have to do ? - to get more
Oh, my heart is too young
If you want just your fun
Miss you so deep tonight
Babe, I'm dying in your eyes
