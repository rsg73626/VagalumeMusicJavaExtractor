SMOKEY JOE'S CAFÉ

There's no montain that's high enough
Oh, to break the ways of love
Where is all the feeling gone ?
On this new world, baby
Deep in the heart of you
You know what your love can do
Seven lonely nights and days
You're walking through fire, baby
Dreams will never die
Come on my baby, let us try
Pull the strings of all emotions
In the shadow's nights

In Smokey Joe's Café
I'll see you back again
In Smokey Joe's Café
At the rainbow's end
These fight won't last forever
Babe, when we stay together
Come let us build a better world

In Smokey Joe's Café

Oh, we're living in a world of dreams
And we're hiding behind the shrims
Sunshine feeds the brand new world
In this heartbeat city, babyBR> City of lost and found
We are young and we will count
All the tears to a better life
Meet me in the dreamland, baby
Dreams will never lie
Come on my baby, let us try
Pull the strings of all emotions
In the shadow's nights

In Smokey Joe's Café
