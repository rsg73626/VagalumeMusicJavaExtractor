STRANGERS BY NIGHT

When you're down and feeling blue
    Close your eyes, I'll be with you
    Oh heartache, you cause heartache
    Making love for him was fun
    You never needed anyone
    Oh heartache, you cause heartache

    Strangers by night
    Be strangers tomorrow
    'Cause deep in the night
    The light is fooling your heart
    And lovers tonight
    It's time to hide
    A lover tomorrow
    We're lovers by night
    Sometimes we're strangers today

    Nights want last forever, girl
    Strange are the ways of this world
    Oh heartache, you cause heartache
    Cinderella, heroes wait
    For your heart times, it's too late
    Oh heartache, you cause heartache

    Strangers tonight
    Be strangers tomorrow
    Lady tonight
    Tonight, tonight, be careful with love
    Some lovers too hot, too hot to stop
    Are bad boys tomorrow
    And lovers by night
    Sometimes we're strangers today
