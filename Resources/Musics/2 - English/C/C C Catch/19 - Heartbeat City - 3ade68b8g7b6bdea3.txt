HEARTBEAT CITY

Oh, he's young and strong - eyes like ivory
He's my heart and soul - he's a mystery
Oh, he's born to win and he's loving me
In the night he lives for love
And like the moon he was made for my nights
He's my friend - he's my lover
Side by side

Do you know the way to heartbeat city, yeah
Everybody's talking he's so pretty, yeah
And tonight is the night - all my dreams come alive
Give me more - give me more of that stuff
Do you know the way to heartbeat city, yeah
Everybody's talking he's so pretty, yeah
In a world made of steel
Baby, ooh I can feel that this place give me more of your love

If I be ......... that I'm born again
Oh, I heard him say : love is a crazy game
Oh, we're just a woman and just a man
In the night we live for love
If you'll hear oceans beating in my heart
Going through emotion from the start
