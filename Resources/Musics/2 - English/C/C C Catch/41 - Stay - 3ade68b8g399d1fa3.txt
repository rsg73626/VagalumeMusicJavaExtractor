STAY

The extreme is played with hearts
ABC of love to me
Troubles storm are paradise maybe

Love will hurt, love for you
If it's too hot to stop maybe
Stay by me tonight
Keep a love alive

REFRAIN:
Stay (stay)
And listen to your heart (heart)
I'm hungry for your love
You always play a game tonight
Two wrongs never make it right

Oh baby, stay (stay)
I wanna be your heart (heart)
Let's try a brand new start
'cause I don't want to be alone
I dry the tears I never show

Wasted days and wasted nights
Save my love for you
Always hurt the one you love
It's true

Helpless fire of desire
Are the ways of love to me
Stay by me tonight
Only love survive

Stay (stay)
And listen to your heart (heart)
I'm hungry for your love
You always play a game tonight
Two wrongs never make it right

Oh baby, stay (stay)
I wanna be your heart (heart)
Let's try a brand new start
'cause I don't want to be alone
I dry the tears I never show
