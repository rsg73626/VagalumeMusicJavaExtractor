SOUL SURVIVOR

Lady
lady
la - you hurt me
oh
don't make me cry
Leavin' me
oh girl
it's easy
he will say good-bye.
It's a hard time for lovers and a broken dream to you
Let me stay together
my love
forever
I never wanna
wanna feeling blue.
By me: S-s-s-soul survivor
oh
come on
take me higher
Don't let me down
oh
it's just too late
girl.
S-s-s-soul survivor
it's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
Tonight
the night
it's alright.
Nothing
lady
hurts forever
stop your lipstick lies
He will spend the nights together just with me
don't try
'Cause my love is so precious
love will never be the same
And I'm never lonely
'cause he's the only
I never wanna
wanna play a game.
Be my: S-s-s-soul survivor
oh
come on
take me higher
. . .
It's the night
it's the night
yeah
he'll win my heart
It's the night of my burning dream.
Secret love
secret love
oh
I wanna start
I'll never wanna lose you
baby
oh
I'll never break apart.
Be my: S-s-s-soul survivor
oh
come on
take me higher
. . .
