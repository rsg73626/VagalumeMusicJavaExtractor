FIRE OF LOVE

Heart to heart - I need to surrender
Don't look back - my blue eyes cry
Face to face - oh loving me tender
Oh, again and again - baby, dreams will fly
Lost in love - afraid of a stranger
I'm too young to cry my tears
Love's life - instead of a danger
Oh, again and again babe, I hate the disease
Baby, you're the man who save my world babe
Baby, you're the man and I'm your girl
Face to face and heart to heart, babe
You're playing the game and you play it smart

Oh, it's a fire of love - a fire of love
That you'll share with me
Oh, it's a fire of love - a fire of love
And my love's free

Cheek to cheek - we're staying together
Don't give up - just you and me
Tears of love - we're staying forever
Oh again and again - 'cause I feel what you feel
Touch a hand and feel the desire
Don't waste days - don't waste nights
Make a friend and feel the fire
Oh, again and again baby, hold me tight
Baby, you're the man who save my world babe
Baby, you're the man and I'm your girl
Face to face and heart to heart, babe
You're playing the game and you play it smart
