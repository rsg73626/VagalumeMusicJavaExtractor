HEAR WHAT I SAY

I walked into your life
Something told me that love lay in your eyes
I feel like it's going all wrong
But I never knew love like this before

So say sweet words like you mean them
Say sweet words to me 'cause I need them

Hey hear what I say
Don't take this love away now
Hey hear what I say
- (Don't take this love - no, not my love) -
Don't take this love away now - (away) -
No no no no no (not my love)
Don't take this love now, no

You have walked out of my life
And you left me with the pain down deep inside
Played around searching
For something more
Now you never had love like this before
