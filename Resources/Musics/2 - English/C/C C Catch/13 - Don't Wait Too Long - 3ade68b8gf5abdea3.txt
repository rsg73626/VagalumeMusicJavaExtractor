DON'T WAIT TOO LONG

Another time, another place
Heart to heart and face to face
Can you hear my heart beating through the night ?
Oh what a night, another night
A good heart is hard to find
Can you hear my heart beating through the night ?
Can you feel my heart crying deep inside ?

Don't wait too long (too long)
Don't waste your time (your time)
You'll never find a love
A love is more than mine
Don't wait too long (too long)
We're young and strong (so strong)
Oh babe, you'll find a love
A place where you belong

You wasted days and wasted nights
On your way to paradise
Can you hear my heart beating through the night ?
You can make it if you try
With your supernova smile
Can you hear my heart beating through the night ?
Can you feel my heart crying deep inside
