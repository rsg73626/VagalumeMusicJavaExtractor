ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

I'm in the arms of love
I want to lose control
Oh, come and get that stuff
Oh, love will let me go
I never ever touch a man that talks too much
My love will left you up - I got a bet on you
I'll never get enough - oh, what you wanna do
You're so hot in the night
I .................
I know that it's right, tonight

Are you serious ? - babe when you break my heart
Are you serious ? - you will tear apart
Are you serious ? - babe when you're next to me
Are you serious ? - oh, it's extasy

Don't be afraid of me
I'll find my way back home
I'll never set you free - love is a danger zone
I never ever touch a man that talks too much
Don't take my love to town - oh, I'm much too young
Don't let him get you down
Oh, when two hearts beat as one
You're so hot in the night
......................
I know that it's right, tonight
