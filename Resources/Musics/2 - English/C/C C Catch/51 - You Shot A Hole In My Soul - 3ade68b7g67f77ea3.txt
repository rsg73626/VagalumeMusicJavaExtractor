YOU SHOT A HOLE IN MY SOUL

He's a midnight, new romancer
He's the only, lonely dancer
Oh, only love breaks my heart
He is the nearst thing to heaven
Stole my heart
Try to save him
Oh, only love breaks my heart
You shot a hole in my soul
It's the countdown for love, I know
You shot a hole in my soul
Hold on tight don't let go
You get always what you want from me
You can make it easy, can't you see
You shot a hole, hole, hole, hole in my soul
Dreams go on forever and ever
Good things do not last forever
Heaven can wait but I got
But I do need once again, babe
I think tomorrow it's too late, babe
Oh, only love breaks my heart
