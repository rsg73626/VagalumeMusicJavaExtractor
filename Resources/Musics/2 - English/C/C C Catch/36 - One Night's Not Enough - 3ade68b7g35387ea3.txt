ONE NIGHT'S NOT ENOUGH

Every little thing's been said about it
Babe, you know you light up my day
Everybody hates to live without it
And I hope you don't go away
A bitter start with tears
I can forget my fears

One night's not enough, can't you see
You get all my love away from me
One night's not enough, can't you see
Breaking up
Breaks my heart
One night's not enough, can't you see
Baby, if you will ever set me free
Then our love will break my heart forever and ever

The way you love is very special to me
Maybe my dreams will come true
And I know, if you should ever leave me
I would never feel so brand new
Maybe behind your eyes
There will be bad surprise

Love lost it's meaning
It will never stop bleeding

One night's not enough, can't you see
Baby, if you will ever set me free
Then our love will break my heart forever and ever

When my heart is breaking
You find my tears are waking
'Cause I feel so lonely, you are my only
Love lost it's meaning
