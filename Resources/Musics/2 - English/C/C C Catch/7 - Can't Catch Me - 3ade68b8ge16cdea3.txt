CAN'T CATCH ME

You touch my feelings
You touch my soul
You held my body
And now I'm loosing control
Give me what I want
Just give me healing
Open up inside
And show your feelings

Love is what you want
But you can't catch me
Love is what you want
Love is what you want

We played like children
Until the sun goes down
Life has more meaning
Because of what we found
I ask for what I want
You gave me healing
Let go of all the pride
And show your feelings
