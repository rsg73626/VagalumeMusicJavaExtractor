DON'T BE A HERO

Hearts of stone looks at you
Diamond smiles
Oh, what you feel
Oh anyway, it's not too late
Remember all the lies you made
Oh, dreams go on - I lost my mind
Oh, it's hard a love to find
Yeah, I don't care - cry for you
Anyway, like dreamers do

You touched my life, feel my heart
Over and over we'll try a start

Baby don't don't don't be a hero tonight !
Baby don't don't don't be a fool !
If your heart is been broken, I'll be by your side.
Baby don't don't don't break the rules !

King of fools take your time
Oh, I lose this heart of mine
Yeah, no more tears, I'm born to run
Oh, my baby, we are young
Oh, feel my heart - can't explain
Now I feel your love again
Oh anyway, win my love
Over and over I need that stuff

You touched my life, feel my heart
Over and over we'll try a start

Baby don't don't don't break the rules
