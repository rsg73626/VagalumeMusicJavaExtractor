GIVE ME WHAT I WANT

Now I'm sitting here all alone
Another message on the answerphone
- Oh, no -
Hanging on when there's no time - no time -
I think that's my warning sign

You're acting strange
Just keep no distance
When I feel your love
There is no resistance
Time won't wait for us
'cause we're in love - we're in love -

Give me what I want
'cause I want satisfaction
Give me what I need
Set up that chain reaction
Give me what I want
'cause I want satisfaction
Now - with you - with you - only you -

You gimme what I want
And it better be real
Or the bass drum or the snare you feel
(No way!)
'cause I'm up on the mike
Like all through the night
I'm givin' you my lovin'
And givin' it right (oh, yea!)
You stay on my mind like all the time
I think about you girl when I'm bossin' a rym
I'm a dog yeah
I'm in heat (big deal!)
Satisfaction is what I need

You're acting strange
Just keep no distance
When I feel your love
There's no resistance
Time won't wait for us
'cause we're in love

I'll give you my loving
You give me your love, love, love, love
When you give me this feeling
That's all I need - I want it right now

Give me what I want
'cause I want satisfaction
Give me what I need
Set up that chain reaction

(and Hollywood is messin' around)
