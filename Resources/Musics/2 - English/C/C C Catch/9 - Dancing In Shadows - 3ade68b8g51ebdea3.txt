DANCING IN SHADOWS

Oh, when my heart beats baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love hurts maybe
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, gonna stop it
Baby, gonna stop your heart
Like a burning fire
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It will lift you higher
Baby, gonna stop it
Never gonna stop it
Baby, gonna save your heart

Oh come tonight, oh come tonight
We're dancing in shadows
I can hear your heartbeat's calling every night
Oh come tonight, oh come tonight
We're dancing in shadows
Friends and strangers, baby, walking side by side

Dancing in shadows, dancing in shadows

Oh, when my heart beats baby
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah
A heartbeat's calling
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, come and stop me
Baby, gonna stop my heart
The time is like the right time
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah
From the rest in the skyline
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah
They'll hurt you baby
Heart is broken maybe
Baby come and stop your heart

I can hear your heartbeat's calling every night
Oh come tonight, oh come tonight
We're dancing in shadows
Friends and strangers, baby, walking side by side
Oh come tonight, oh come tonight
We're dancing in shadows
