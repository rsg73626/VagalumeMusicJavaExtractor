CAUSE YOU ARE YOUNG

Heartache, heartache
Heart was gold
All it had you
Instant cold
Lonely, lonely
Your wasted years
You're a winner with bad souvenirs
You're a hero
You're a man
You're a winner
Take my hand

'Cause you are young
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams, hold on (hold on)
You are right (you are right) 
Don't give up
'Cause you are young (are young)
You are right and you're wrong (are wrong)
You are a hero, next day you're done (you're done)
So hold on to your dreams

All or nothing
You can give
Live your life
Love to live
Oh man, oh man
Feel the night
Strong enough till the morning light
You are a hero
You are a man
You are too tough to lose this game
