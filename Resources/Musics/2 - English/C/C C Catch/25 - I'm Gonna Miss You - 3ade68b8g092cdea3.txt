I'M GONNA MISS YOU

I lie awake here in my bed
Picturing the fight I've had with you
(Tears around my eyes)
I've hoped you would understand
Boy you're not my lover
(Would you like me to tell you lies)

Never meant to hurt your feelings
Don't meant to ruin your day
But if you thought twice
And you know what you're doing
I won't stand in your way

Don't you know that I'm gonna miss you
(I'm gonna miss you)
Don't you know that I'm gonna miss you

We were friends for all those years
I have shared my fun and tears with you
(We grew up together)
Gonna get through without you though
I'll never find a friend like you I know
(Thought you were my friend forever)
