IF I FEEL LOVE

Heaven baby stand the heat
It's a danger - love is deep
Follow me in a dream of you, my love
Oh, baby, baby - you will win
Do you think 'oh, it's a sin ?'
Loving me to extasy

If I feel love
I say alright
'Cause I know baby, you make my night
If I feel love
I say okay
'Cause baby ever you hold me
Yes means that you love for ever
You'll dance in heavy weather
No means that I'll be so lonely
'Cause you're the one, the one and only

Hunters, baby, will survive
You will have a better life
Follow me in a dream of you, my love
Oh, baby baby - you will win
Do you think oh, it's a sin ?
Loving me to extasy
