STOP-DRAGGIN' MY HEART AROUND

Stop-Draggin' My Heart Around

Save me
When I hurt you?
Secret messege
Dangers games
Reach out
Love its so proud
If the countdown
To my dream
Its so danger
You're a stranger

Boy,Stop-draginn' my heart around
I'm qualified to satifisted
I'm qualified for love my baby
Stop-draginn' my heart around
Close yours eyes and count to ten
I'm stand here again oh baby, oh baby

Save me
From this hurt light
Oh I'm looking
To magic tears
God knows
Our love growns
Oh I'm feeling
In my fears
Its so danger
You're a stranger
