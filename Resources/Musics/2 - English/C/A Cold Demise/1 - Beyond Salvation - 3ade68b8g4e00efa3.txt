BEYOND SALVATION

Arround,all arround,the storm clauds gather
The night falls as if slain by the sun
Souless I'am
It is a night of heartache,a song of ethereal pain
Wolves vent theire howls,the dark one awakes

The salvation for which I pray
Flares once,then dies
Devoured by madness
My dread grows as the angry hand of heaven
Falls against my nacked soul
It wounds me,and darkly my blood drips

To the thirsty earth
In agony I hand my head
While death's shadow looms over me
Now alone,my soul falls upon sad eyes
I am dying here,bound to pain
Finding my way through this hurtfull agony
My heart so empty and torn
Slender beams of moonlight

Enter this bleak place as I kneel
Always in pain,always lost,
Frozen here waiting
This darked so betrayed
A deadly emptiness
This is my salvation.
