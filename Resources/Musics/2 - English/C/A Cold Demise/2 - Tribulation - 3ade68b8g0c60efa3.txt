TRIBULATION

I am overwhelmed by one thing
A thing you don't wish to anybody
This thing is called pain
It's caused by a few words

I am angry,destroyed,sad from the inside
Caused because of a fucking life
I feel devastated
All I can think of is pain,malice

Does this end good
Or will it be over ?
This depends on something
A hell of a good excuse.
