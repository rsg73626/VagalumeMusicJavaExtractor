MAYHEM

Strikes!
You won't see my back
Ready to shed all the blood I've got
Let's hold back all the laughs
Falling through the cracks
I am fighting with guts for no glory
Seeing the chair, kicked under your fucking feet
Smiling like I've never plan to quit
I'm still standing

I'd better die
Instead of showing you my back
So don't cry
If I broke both of your arms
I am fighting with guts for no glory
To make my place down here
I am fighting with guts for no glory
With broken bones, sutures and bruises

I'm gonna stand right here
Walking into the blood of all the friends lost
I'd better die
Instead of leaving this now
So don't cry
If I have to break both your arms
Seeing the chair, kicked under your fucking feet
Smiling like I've never plan to quit
I'm still standing
