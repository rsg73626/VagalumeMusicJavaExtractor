GET OUT ALIVE

And now it comes to this
Taking it all back to a new beginning
This is the final step to cross the line we've been drawing
Our hands baring the shapes of ink
Our eyes staring at unseen places
Now feel through the void
The echoes of our own voice

We won't give up on us
We're gonna set things straight
Cause you've said, you've said
That we would fall again
Now I'm sure, you're looking at us
Won't stop can't stop speaking about us
Now I'm sure, you're looking at us
Won't stop can't stop talking

As a wish come true
Tell me, did it stop this flood?
Save our soul, save your soul
As a wish come true
Tell me, did it save your soul?
Before this flood takes it all
We're back at it again
Taking it all back to a new beginning
How many times did we cross the line we've been drawing
Our eyes know the shapes of ink
Get out alive, and still awake

What can be done? Who will you be?
What can be done? Who can you become?
It's your choice so tell me
So tell me
Before this flood takes it all
Takes it all
As a wish come true
Tell me, did it stop this flood?
Save our soul, save your soul
As a wish come true
Tell me, did it save your soul?
Before this flood takes it all
