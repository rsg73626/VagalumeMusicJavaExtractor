CRIMSON PAGES

I used to be blinded by your grin
I used to be deaf to the truest speaks
For far too long you hid me from the dawn
To keep me so fucking cold
You imposed to me to endure your grief
You made all these shits our reality
But you're nothing but a ghost in disguise
Who can only live through others eyes. "oh"
Your life's a lie

So it goes without saying that you let us feeling hurt
So it goes without saying that you let us fall to dust
There's nothing left to save
Nothing left to hope, cause the boredom
Have take what's left of our souls
There's nothing left to save
Nothing left to give, cause the pain
Have take what's left of my own

But I won't be torn by your horns
I'll nail your coffin and let you burn alone
You imposed to me to endure your grief
You made all these shits our reality
But you're nothing more than ashes
You're not worthing anything

There's nothing left to give
Nothing left to save, there is nothing left to breathe
Cause the flames have burn the pages
To finally let the end dramaticly empty
Have let us empty
Have let the end dramaticly empty
