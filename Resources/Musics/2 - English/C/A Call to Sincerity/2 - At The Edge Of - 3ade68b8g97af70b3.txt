AT THE EDGE OF

If you're going this way you're gonna be downed
I'm holding your hand but it means no safety
Where's your pride in all this?
You're crawling away from everything you can't face
Running to hide yourself, running to numb the conflict

You can build the bridge from both sides
Pilling the bricks with both hands
You won't pick how you want to quit
So just pick up an exit
My help had to end
So find your own way to live
You won't pick how you want to quit
So please
Release my hand and walk away

Trust me, you're the one to blame
It's a constant fighting to find dignity and grace
So you have to struggle with all you possess
This life only reward the braves
You saw the proofs, so just be yourself
You need to make your steps
You're not alone and you'll never be

You won't pick how you want to quit
So just pick up an exit
My help had to end
So find your own way to live
Release my hand and walk away
