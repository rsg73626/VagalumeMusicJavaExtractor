OUR WORLD

I've never had apathy for you
You need to know what I've always thought
I've always been here for you (here for you)
Welcoming tears with my arms open
So consider this as my apology

Yet I'm talking to you, open hearted
You need to know what I've always thought
I can't live without you
I've always been here for you (here for you)
So I will never rest
Until we fix this

I am the one you can count on
I am the one who'll never leave
Tell me, who was lying first?
I've find the truth under the bridge drown in the water
Tell me, which one of us
Is gonna dive down here to take it all back
To take it all back

I am the one you can count on
I am the one who'll never leave
I am the one you can trust in
I am the one who'll never leave
I am the one who will never rest
