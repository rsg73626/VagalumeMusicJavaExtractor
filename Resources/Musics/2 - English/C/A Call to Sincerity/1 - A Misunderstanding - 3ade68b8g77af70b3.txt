A MISUNDERSTANDING

We have found in ourselves a reason to give it all back
Take a look deep down inside us
A treasure is hidden there
This is to the cold blooded and the ever blamed
Cause we are nothing but pawns lost in your schemes
Just let them know that you won't be part of their plan
We've build it all up, we've made it all up
You left it fucked falling to ruins

Twice the pride, double the fall
They're fighting back waiting for the curtain call
They won't be backing down, they'll never be backing down
They're fighting back waiting for the curtain call
Their mouth got so much left to say so just hear it scream
Burn this place to the ground, sing your fucking heart out
We are alive

I can feel the blood boiling in me
And there is so much left to share
I can feel the blood boiling in me
And there is so much time left to spend
This is to the cold blooded and the ever blamed
Just let them know that you won't be part of their plan
