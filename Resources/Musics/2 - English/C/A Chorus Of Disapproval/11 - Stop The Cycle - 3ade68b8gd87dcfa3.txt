STOP THE CYCLE

In one ear - out the other - why bother?
This is not - for my health - it comes from anger
My bite - worse than my bark - so don't try me
Ball and chain - stuck like a leech - Untie me!

I fight - to keep my soul free
Who the fuck are you - to bark up my tree?

You take the cake - you fucking traitor - don't talk down to me
When Push - comes to shove - you'll be on your knees
Be for my hand - but for my help - I'll keep walking, man
One Time around - is all you get - so stop the cycle

Turncoat - walk away - don't look back!
