JUSTICE

I reserve the right - To ignore your kind
I reserve the right - Remain still, Unblind
I reserve the right - To step across the line
I reserve the right - Remain still, Unblind
I reserve the right - To bend and collide
I reserve the right - Remain still, Unblind
I reserve the right - Fight for what's right
I reserve the right - Remain still, Unblind

I'm the Justice that you fear so much
I'm the justice that's so out of touch
I'm the justice, Judge, and the jury
I'm the justice - persecute in a hurry

I am justice!
I am justice!
I am justice!
I am justice!

Stomp!

(You've gone soft man)
