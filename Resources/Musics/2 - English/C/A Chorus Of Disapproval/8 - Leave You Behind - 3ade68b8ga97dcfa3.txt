LEAVE YOU BEHIND

You follow the road to the end of the path
The end of the path means your time is up
Your stagnate, don't move, is what you do best
Asleep at the wheel, man you never gave a shit

Leaving you behind I can't look back
Your oppression drives me - HEART ATTACK!
You bring me down like an anchor to the sea floor
I've just about had it - NO MORE!

Don't try to follow me

Jump of the gun you fell apart
Didn't listen when warned - FALSE START!
Full-size lies, lies life-size
You stand for everything - I DESPISE!

Lies life size full size lies life size
Lies life size full size lies life size
