REPLACEMENT AND 12XU

I have nothing further to say
You've just fucked up again, man

I don't have time for a strung-out like you
I don't want to hear you verbal spew
The drugs took your money
Soon they will take everything
You're just a strung-out loser
Caught in a fucking drug ring

And I don't feel sorry for you

(And then an instrumental version of 12XU)
