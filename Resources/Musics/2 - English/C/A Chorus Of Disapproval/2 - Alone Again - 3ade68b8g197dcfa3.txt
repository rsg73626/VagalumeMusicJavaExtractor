ALONE AGAIN

I don't know what the fuck you're thinking
All I know is I'm aside myself
The one thing that kept you sane
You walked fine line for so long

I can't beleive the way you act
Take me for granted when I did so much
You tried my patience and I tried so hard
Stuck in a cycle of malcontent

I don't know what the fuck you're thinking
All I know is I'm aside myself
The one thing that kept you sane
You walked fine line for so long

Tell me how can I live without you
When you're so hurt by the risks we take
But days roll by in silent dischord
Follow your heart to the outside

Out on my own - Struggle for a life again
Left for dead - Left for dead again
God don't leave me alone again
God don't leave me alone again
