BLEED

I cut myself before my brother
Do the same for me
Two is one
Equals Strength some people can't see
Life or death
Happy or sad
Always in my heart
There is just no human power that can pull us apart

Open your eyes if you can't see the same for me
Stand by your side
Under attack
For you I'd bleed
Fairweather friends come and go
This I can accept
This door is open for me always
My brother you won't regret
