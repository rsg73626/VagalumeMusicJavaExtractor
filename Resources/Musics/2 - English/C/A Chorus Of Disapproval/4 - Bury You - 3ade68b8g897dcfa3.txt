BURY YOU

I die to try
You live a lie
I feel fine
Clear fucking mind
You can't stand
On your own
I'll bury you
Like a bone

Your body abused, tattered, and torn
Far from the way, the way you were born
Pure, impure - There is a difference
I disapprove, feel the anger in my chorus
All I do is bow my head in shame
And look to myself for the blame
But you know and I know it's not my fault
Still I find myself mad and distraught over you
