MAGIC SYMPHONY (FEAT. GIANG PHAM)

That little boy always wanted people to dance
That little boy always dreamed about a big chance
Day after day he always heard this melody
He didn't know it was the magic
Symphony
Hear a magic symphony

Hear a magic symphony
Just feel free
Here with me
Hear a magic symphony
Let us hear
You and me
Hear a magic symphony

That little boy tried to realise his dreams
That little boy has grown up he can do what he feels
Day after day he always hears this melody
But now he knows that it's a magic symphony
Hear a magic symphony

Just feel free
Here with me
Hear a magic symphony
Let us hear
You and me
Hear a magic symphony
Day after day
Just you and me
Hear a magic symphony
Just feel free
Here with me
Hear a magic symphony

Hear a magic symphony
Just feel free
Here with me
Hear a magic symphony
Let us hear
You and me
Hear a magic symphony
Day after day
Just you and me
Hear a magic symphony
Just feel free
Here with me
Hear a magic symphony
