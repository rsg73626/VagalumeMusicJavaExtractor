NEVER GO AWAY

If you ever want to leave it all
If you ever want to lose control
Leave it all escape so far away
Maybe then you'll think it is ok
But I'll tell you how I see it now
Take the guittar and I'll tell how
I just wanna show you how to stay

Listen and you'll never go away

In the glow of starry sky
Seven nigths I would lie
Now I know I want stay
I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I want stay

I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away-ay-ay
I will never go away

Listen and you'll never go away

In the glow of starry sky
Seven nigths I would lie
Now I know I want stay
I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I want stay

I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away-ay-ay
I will never go away

I will never go away
Now I know I want stay
Now I know I want stay
Now I know I want stay
I will never go away

I will never go away
Now I know I want stay
Now I know I want stay stay stay stay stay
I will never go away

In the glow of starry sky
Seven nigths I would lie
Now I know I want stay
I will never go away

In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I want stay
I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away

Listen and you'll
Never go away go away go away
