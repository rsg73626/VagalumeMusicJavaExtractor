SIN SOCIETY

We're so eager to make this place like hell
We're so genious to enslave this world so well
The scourge of man and Babylon's whore
There's no need for a scapegoat anymore

We crave for oil, land money and might
We go to war when a thought seems right
We leave no chance to conquer and spread
Maybe we forgot what we shouldn't forget

So, God, where is your flood right now
The great extermination show
God is dead, we're the winners
Incomprehensible lucky sinners
