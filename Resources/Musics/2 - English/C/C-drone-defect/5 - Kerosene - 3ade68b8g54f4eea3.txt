KEROSENE

Greed burning like kerosene
We need ever more, so much more and still more
Velocity is rising, we have to keep up the pace
We crave, we hunger, we envy; we keep moving on
Nothing can stop us, nothing can soothe us
We are the gluttonous ones

We will never be contempt
Too much is not enough
We will never feel complete
Let the hunger never stop
We're running out of time
There's no turning back
When the final bell will chime
We hear our breaking neck
