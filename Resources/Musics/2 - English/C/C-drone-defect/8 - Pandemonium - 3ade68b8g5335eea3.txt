PANDEMONIUM

A paragon among man
Feeling like a wolf among sheep to be torn
A paragon among gods
Acting like a child still awake late at night
A paragon lost in sleep
Dreaming of a place where his mind can be free
A paragon lost in thought
Thinking of a time when his mind will unveil

Pandemonium…a face you know
So much more deep below
Pandemonium…you never know
Pandemonium…demon in disguise
A construct of masks and lies
Pandemonium…silent cries
Pandemonium…here in this mind
A crazed virtue of aberant kind
Pandemonium…you're so blind
