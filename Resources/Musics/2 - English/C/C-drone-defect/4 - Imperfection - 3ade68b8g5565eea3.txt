IMPERFECTION

Burning bridge, and kingdoms fall
The strongest shall survive, the winner takes all
Bitter words from narrow minds
Drawing future plans of endless boundry lines

Oh, nothing stays the same
We cannot keep from drowning in a sea of sadness
Oh, nothing stays the same
We cannot keep from drowning in a sea of sadness

A waste of time at the end of the day
A former shinging light fades away
helping hands will knock you down
Changing empires into ghosttowns 
A haggard man, cold and pale
Place the highest bid, a lifetime up for sale
Mask the fear of frail rejection
Fall victim to nature's imperfections

Oh, nothing stays the same
We cannot keep from drowning in a sea of sadness
Oh, nothing stays the same
We cannot keep from drowning in a sea of sadness
