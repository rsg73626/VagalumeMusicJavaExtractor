HYPOCRITE

Don't believe in you and me
We're caught in conspiracy
As long as the sirens sing
We will fear everything
We need the words
We speak the words
Of consequent deception
We lick our wounds
But they won't heal
Remain in sweet seduction

System shock, failure
Persecution mania
The cause and the effect
Far too late to regret

Make the final stroke
The spirits you invoke
Set free what you conceal
And your wounds will heal
It has been forever here
Chimera of constant fear
Menace of society
Philistine hypocrisy
