FALSE ALARM

Apologies, I've given them all
how much more to pay?
Shoot me a glance worth a thousand words
But I've nothing left to say
You can never wipe away the shame
Of atrocities caused in my name
Walk away all mad, but come back for more
Then walk away again, Its the same old game

I'm sorry if i'm putting on a show
But if it's wrong why does it feel right?
I beg of you don't leave me in the cold
But when open arms are false alarms, I'll know it's over

You serve in the court of the public thought
And put me on trail
Turn the words I spoke in good faith aginst me
My crimes are now on file
In this secret world I spoke in good faith aginst me
My crimes are now on file
In this secret world of faith and trust
there isn't room for revengeful lust
And as soon as I let down my guard
It's decency you'll disregard

I'm sorry if i'm putting on a show
But if it's wrong why does it feel right?
I beg of you don't leave me in the cold
But when open arms are false alarms, I'll know it's over

And now i stand here all alone
And it is all to clear
How you wore me down like sand from stone
Yet you never shed a tear
What a sorry state of times
to be guilty of the wrong crimes

I'm sorry if i'm putting on a show
But if it's wrong why does it feel right?
I beg of you don't leave me in the cold
But when open arms are false alarms, I'll know it's over
