QUEEN OF HEARTS

She follows the crowd
to a place of her own
people with wine
and taste as her own
when people are grown
feelings aren't shown
that's why we're here
and you're not alone
Minds are what you should follow
All the papers are writing
of drugs and her fighting
you can't stop the lightning
she's on her way
to a beautiful day
All the flavour is gone
she's no longer strong
she needed me to tag along

She walks through the city
proud like a queen
what she holds in her hand
is something you've never seen
abused and in pain
oh the crowd goes insane
light up the stage
pour up the champagne
