NAKED WITH OPEN EYES

I watch the sun go down
As i feel the coldness crawling unto me
I'm sitting huddled up
Trying to figure out the meaning of existence
Yet i have found no ancwers (no ancwers at all)

I feel so small still i must be most
Powerfull of all
Suddenly it stood clear
There in the light of dawn
First sunbeams of day

A vision for me appeared
A thought to tame
Behold life, meaningless and empty
What have we learned ?
The awareness makes me scared
I don't mean to say that i am better in any way
It's just that i want something higher

I watch the sun goes down as i feel
The coldness crawling unto me

I'm sitting huddled up
Trying to figure out the meaning of existence
Yet i have found no ancwers
I feel so small, still i must be most
Powerfull of all
Suddenly it stood clear
There in the light of dawn
First sunbeams of day
A vision for me appeared

A thought to tame
Behold life meaningless and empty
What have we learned ?
The awareness makes me scared
I don't mean to say that i am better in any way

It's just that i want something higher
