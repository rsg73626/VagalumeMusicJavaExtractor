REALM OF RAIN

Misty shadows grips the heart
Souls reunite in order of chaos

[*] Wnite knights guards the treasures of dreams
In the centre of the storm a man is to emerge
To find the pleasure beyond the lost horizon
Now hidden beyond a realm of rain

Entering the vein of black
Blood runs red in seas of sorrow
Tne sun burns grey in a cloudy sky
Confusion!

Many questions why?
It's time to leave this earthly palace
The crystal is stolen, as worlds collapse
Reality disappears, shaking in disgust
The crystal leads astray

A foul taste of truth
Blood runs red in the flow of forever
Springs of salt runs down the face
Left alone in silent disgrace

[*repeat]

As the leaves slowly falls to the ground
Forever captured spirits of life
The pathis gone without a trace
Lost in a universe of deceit
But somewhere in the distant
(a light breaths its last sigh)
