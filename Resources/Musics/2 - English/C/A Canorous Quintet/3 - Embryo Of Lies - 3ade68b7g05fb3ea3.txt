EMBRYO OF LIES

Hidden thoughts of hate
Trying to manipulate the fate
Unseen is the power of every man
They who see they don't understand
(blind, blinded by fear)
Truth they will not hear
Neverending sadness
Turn into pure madness

[*] a beatiful pattern op emptiness
An empire op distress
The ruler of darkness
In an embryo of lies

Unseen is thi power of every man
They who see they don't understand
Neverending sadness
Turn into pure madness

[*repeat]

On memories they feed
But the air is so hard to breath
Short fragments of delight
To forget the icy fright

Wish hothihg else but to die
And to stop the internal cry
Waiting for the ehd to come
Soon it will all be gone

[*repeat]
