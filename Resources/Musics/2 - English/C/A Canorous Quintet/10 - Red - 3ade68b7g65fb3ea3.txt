RED

Trust! The blind man leads the way
A burnt out candle in the hand
Chasing for eternity nevermore
Pleased witn being lost forever
The touch on your face, it's lost

Too weak, too afraid to find salvation
Liquid illusions all that is seen
Believe in easy dreams. You can have it all!
Thoughts becomes to real, the end is hear!

Sun moon nothing's left to see
Stars all surrounding us
As we enter into endless nignt
It burns inside, tear it apart

Leave it all, face grim reality
Shed a tear for the lost
Weakness lies in trust

And the foolish await the arrival
Castle of promises imprisoned
Don't believe the words!

[Repeat verse 3]

[*] red is the colour of our dreams
Our blood, our life, our nignt

When all ends up darkened
Red is the colour of our dreams

Our blood, our life. Our night
I'm bleeding to death, red

[Repeat verse 4]
[*repeat]
