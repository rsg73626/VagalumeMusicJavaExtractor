THE EVE OF THE ENTITIES

A storm approaches on hallows eve
A storm that's feared for centuries
The ancient prophets told of a night
When the spirits and demons would rise

For it is told when man lost hope
Chaos and tragedy ran rampant
The barrier is broke in the spirit world
Demons gather over the Earth

Cemetery grounds shake and the dead awake
Skies grow black and the night draws near
Wiping out human life is their mission
When they seek you out there's no where you can hide

Eve of the Entities
Eve of the Entities

To fight them is in vein
The undead cannot die
Across the earth they
Fear the army of the dead

The destruction will be immeasureable
Corpses will rise, vampires awake high
In the mountains werewolves soon to transform
Demons climb from the depths of the earth
Restless ghosts will be freed
Skies grow black, night draws near
A night that'll last for centuries

All across the earth they fear that
The harm we humans have done will
Not compare to the pain brought upon
Daylight will perish mankind will perish
Only the spirits remain, skies grow black, night draws near
A night that lasts for centuries

To fight them is in vein, the undead cannot die
Across the earth they fear the army of the dead
Eve of the Entities
Eve of the Entities

The barrier is broke in the spirit world
Demons gather over the earth

The cemetery grounds shook, then the dead uproot
The skies grow black and the night draws near
Wiping out human life is their mission
When they seek you out, there's no where to run
