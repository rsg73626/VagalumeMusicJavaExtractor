RETALIATION

Hate has bleeding within me
I am turned inside out
Wish you felt the pain i feel
A thorn tearing from inside

I bleed the invisible blood
The blood of my soul
I wish i had the strength to turn my back
Turn my rage against you

Make you bleed the way i do
Bury you within my darkness
Stifle in my close embrace
Until there's nothing left to hate
Only the purity of a newborn life

[*] condemned because there is no cause
Seas of sorrow drowing me
I'll live forevermore still nevermore
I'll become your greatest fear
Take you down to me
To perish in hy heart of darkness
Until the end of time

Until the end of time
In this world of pain
Sorrow is all you'll gain
You get what you deserve!
Your daydreams end!
Inside this blackhole of my life
Nothing can exist no more
Forever engulfed,
Forever lost, within myself
Within hy tihe

[Repeat verse 2]
[*repeat]
