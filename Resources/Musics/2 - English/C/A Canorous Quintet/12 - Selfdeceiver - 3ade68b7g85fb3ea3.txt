SELFDECEIVER

Dusk has come to pass
The irreversible darkness surrounds us
Scared away from the light
No mercy will be shown
Your blood will flow
Weakminded, you deserve to die
Filled with the purest of hate
My axe rips the air

Deformed beyond recognition
The unpurest of all
Not even worthy of the ignorance
The ignorance of your slayer
Kneel on command

[*] you, you couldn't believe
Couldn't believe it was for real
Until you realize, that it is you
The selfdeceiver

There is nothing, all must end
For the selfdeceivers

[Repeat verse 3]
[*repeat]

It is you who are crawling
Crawling in a world of shit
And still you enjoy it
But even when there's nothing
Lets to crawl for you're still stuck
In your pile of fucking shit
The blade will fall
To end it all
