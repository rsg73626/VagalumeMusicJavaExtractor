BRUTAL

All there is to see 
All there is to learn 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 

I was numb, I was frail 
Faintly willful, partly present 
I was drifting day by day 
On a rough and salty sea 

I kept crawling, vaguely living 
It was fear until that day 
I kept crawling 
Vaguely living 

Tell me, tell me 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 
Tell me, tell me 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 
Make me, make me 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 
Make me, make me 
Make me recognize 

All there is to see 
All there is to learn 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 

Everything around me looks so vibrantly real 
No other men the other key you and his shackling heel (?) 

Never touched my core 
I never really grew 
Never knew before what it means to be true 

I kept crawling, vaguely living 
I kept crawling, vaguely living 

Tell me, tell me 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 
Tell me, tell me 
All there is to see 
All there is to learn 

All there is to see 
All there is to learn 

All there is to see 
All there is to learn
