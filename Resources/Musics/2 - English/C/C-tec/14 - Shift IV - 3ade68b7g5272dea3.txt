SHIFT IV

The clock says it's 10 AM 
The sheets are not mine, where am I 
I remember vaguely 
Having been here before 

There's no one in the house 
My steps on the stairs don't make any sound 

I open the curtains 
I don't like what I see 

There's fresh food on the plates 
But no smell in the air 

Pet food 
I can't believe my eyes 
There's a giant hole in the roof 

Where is this sky ? 
A dark red sky where the sun is dying 
A dark red sky where the sun is dying 
A dark red sky where the sun is 

I don't like what I see 
(repeat)
