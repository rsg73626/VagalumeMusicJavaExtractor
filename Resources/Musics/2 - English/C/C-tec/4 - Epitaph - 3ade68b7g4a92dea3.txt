EPITAPH

The first time I died, I walked my ways.. 
I followed the file of limping daze.. 

I held me tall with my head flung up 
But I dared not look on the new moonâ€™s cup 

I dared not look on the sweet young rain 
And between my ribs was a gleaming pain 

I dared not look on the sweet young rain 
And between my ribs was a gleaming pain 

The next time I died, they laid me deep 
They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep 
They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern 
They weighted me down with a marble urn 
And I lie here warm, I lie here dry 
And watch the worms slip by, slip by 

I lie here warm, I lie here dry 
And watch the worms slip by, slip by 

Lie warm, lie dry 
Lie warm, lie dry 
Dry, dry
