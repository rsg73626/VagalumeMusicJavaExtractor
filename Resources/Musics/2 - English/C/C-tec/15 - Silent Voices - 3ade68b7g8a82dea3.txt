SILENT VOICES

Well, this time 
You will not 
Get away with what you've done 

And the secret we share 
Won't remain unrevealed very long 

For the ghosts of these days 
Are still out, safe and well after me 
And the pain 
Did not cease 
And the wounds will not heal 

So you see, I can't be a silent voice anymore 

Now the damage is done 
It's too late for regrets 
Now the damage is done 
And I just can't go on 
Now the damage is done 
It's too late for regrets 
Now the damage is done 
And I just can't go on 
So you see 
I can't be 
A silent voice anymore 

So you see 
I can't be 
A silent voice anymore 
So you see 
I can't be 
A silent voice 
Not even for you
