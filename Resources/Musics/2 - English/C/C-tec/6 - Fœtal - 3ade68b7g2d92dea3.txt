FÅ’TAL

I led a million lives.. 
As a saint, as a monster.. 

I was already there when the earth wasn't born 
We were already there, together, floating free 

I've been a drop, I've been a source 
I've been a river, a lake 
I was the fires below the feet of Joan of Arc 

We're on the way to being gods (4x) 

(Be gods) 

I've been a rock, I've been an oak 
I've been a lion, an ape 
I was the look turning humans into statues of light 

I've been a drop, I've been a source 
I've been a river, a lake 
I was the fires below the feet of Joan of Arc 

We're on the way to being gods (3x) 
WE'RE ON THE WAY TO BEING GODS 

(Be gods) 

(Be gods) 

We're on the way to being gods (7x) 
WE'RE ON THE WAY TO BEING GODS 

(Be gods) 

(Be gods)
