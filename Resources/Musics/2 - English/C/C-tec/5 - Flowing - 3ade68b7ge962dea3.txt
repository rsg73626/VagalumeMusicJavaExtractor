FLOWING

Cold light, vibrating low 
Bundles of sound spiraling slow 

No fear, more sense 
More to be felt for all the beings in the know 

Chrous : 
Lose hold 
Just let it go 
Give in, give up, abandon yourself to the flow 
Lose hold 
Just let it go 
Give in, give up, abandon yourself to the flow 

Live moon, mother of all 
Calling those who still wonder in the night 
Live moon, unveiling now 
The part of us already breathing in the light 
Do not seek control 
Do not seek shelter 
The light will find you wherever you might go 
Do not seek control 
Do not seek shelter 
The light will find you 
The light will find you 

(Chorus) 

(Let it go, just let it go) 

(Let it go) 

(Abandon yourself to the flow) (8x)
