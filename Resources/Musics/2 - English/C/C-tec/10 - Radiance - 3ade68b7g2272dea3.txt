RADIANCE

Every time I see you drift away 
The silence seems the same 
What you really mean to me 
You can fill my life with sorrow 
You can take my heart apart 
Say I'll never make it 
You may think I live myself, I might 
You can burn my mind to blazes 
Take or break my vanity 
Force me in a corner 
You will not abuse me anymore 
We will lose each other soon 
And time will sweep away the pain 
We know how, tell me why? 
This can't go on ? 
A blind force, right on the source 
Of our lives, we have to or we fall apart 
This is not what we want 
That's where we are! 

I feel I see tonight 
Your love fills me with fear 
It's the same every time you drift away 
I feel I see tonight 
I wish I wasn't here 
It's the same every time I see you drift away
