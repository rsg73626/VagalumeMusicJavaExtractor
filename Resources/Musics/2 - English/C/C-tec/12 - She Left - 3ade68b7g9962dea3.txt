SHE LEFT

She went like that 
She went without a word 
The rant inside is beating me slowly 

She left, I don't know why she went 
Without a word 
What could I do 
The sun won't shine no more 
Won't shine not anymore 
Not anymore 

I thought this could not happen 
I was so assured to be 
Should be immune 
I know it's not like you say 
The heart that broke in May 
Won't mend in June 

The wound is too large too deep 
My nights bring me no sleep 
My days are slow 
I know my life ainâ€™t over 
I know I will recover 
I'll be fine soon 
I'm about to beg her to come back 
She would be too glad to see me cry 
My life is low 
I don't care who she might be with today 
I guess I had to lose her anyway 
I'll be fine soon 
I'm fine about her new life 
I don't wanna waste success tonight 
My days are slow 

I know my life ain't over 
I know I will recover 
I'll be fine soon 

I'll be fine soon
