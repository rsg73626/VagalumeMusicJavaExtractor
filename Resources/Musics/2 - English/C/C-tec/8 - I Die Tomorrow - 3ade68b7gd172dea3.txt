I DIE TOMORROW

If I could outskip today 
And run a million miles away 
Just anywhere, but fast and far 
Cannot take things as they are 

I'm frozen, I can hardly move on 
I am lost and mad 
My body is nearly gone 
I just want back what I once had 

I lost myself in you, I know 
What's in for me here I failed to see 
I shattered self-estrayed and clumsy 
The black in me can not let go 

Because your fingers trigger a storm 
Because your arms could wrap me so warm 
Because your hands are soft and so slow 
I die tomorrow 

Because your fingers trigger a storm 
Because your arms could wrap me so warm 
Because your hands are soft and so slow 
I die tomorrow 

You gave up what had just begun 
I stayed, you went, I lost, you won 
I wanna free my anger 
I know for sure it's far from over 

One step ahead two leaps backwards 
My wisdom is nothing but words 
My life is a garden under snow 
Where weed but no flowers will grow 

Because your fingers trigger a storm 
Because your arms could wrap me so warm 
Because your hands are soft and so slow 

I die tomorrow 

Because I know my regrets are in vain 
Because I'm drowning once again 
Because it was not served my turn 
Because it will belong to her 

Because your arms could wrap me so warm 
Because your hands are soft and so slow 
Because your fingers trigger the storm 
I die.. 

Tomorrow 

Because your fingers trigger a storm 
Because your arms could wrap me so warm 
Because your hands are soft and so slow 

You gave up what had just begun (2x) 
I stayed, you went, I lost, you won (2x) 
I need to free my anger (2x) 
I know for sure it's far from over (2x) 
Far from over (4x)
