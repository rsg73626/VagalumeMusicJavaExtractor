HUMAN

I'm walking with you.. 
I'm walking with you.. 

Wherever you are 
Whatever you do 
From the day you were born 
Till the day you will be torn 
I will be with you 

No matter the days of the past 
No matter how long you will last 
I am the one you will never see 
The answer of what will be 

Whatever you do, whatever you want 
Whatever you search, and wherever you are 

Whatever you do, whatever you want 
Whatever you search and wherever you might be 
I'm walking with you 

I'm the sun, I'm the moon 
Watching over you 

Whatever you do, whatever you want 
Whatever you search, and wherever you are 
In grace or disgrace or under the yawn 
Chainfaced or displaced, flourishing or broke 

I'm walking with you 
I'm the sun, I'm the moon 

No matter your race, no matter the place 
I'm walking with you 
I'm the sun of your life, I'm the square of your strife 
I'm walking with you 
From the cradle to the cemetery 
I'm walking with you 
I am the presence you can not sense 
I am with you 

Whatever you have to say 
Whatever your questions are 
Remember I'm never far 
Remember my force is yours 

I'm walking with you 

Whatever you do, whatever you want 
Whatever you search, and wherever you are 
In grace or disgrace or under the yawn 
Chainfaced or displaced, flourishing or broke 
No matter your race, no matter your goals 
No matter the place or the depth of the walls 
I'm walking with you 
I'm walking with you 

At the end of the road I will be 
I will be waiting for you
