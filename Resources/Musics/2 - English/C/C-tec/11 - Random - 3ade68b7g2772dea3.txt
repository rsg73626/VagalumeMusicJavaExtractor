RANDOM

Chorus : 
If you feel this is the way for you 
If you hear that kind of call 
If you feel you're really made for this 
If you find out that's what you have to do 

Become indifferent 
Lock yourself out 
Make a lot of noise 
Or live by the rules 

(Chorus) 

If that's your choice 
If it can help 
If you just need that 
But why ask me 

(Chorus) 

If you feel, if you hear 
If you feel, if you find out 

(Chorus) 

If you feel, if you hear 
If you feel, if you find out
