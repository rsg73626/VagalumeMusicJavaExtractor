CHOSEN

The day she came I was 
Unprepared 

I saw her climb 
The broken stair 

She had this charm I was 
Hated envy 

The light in her 
Was pure and white 
The grounds around her burning light 
I met her eyes 

Chorus : 
She was the chosen, she was 
She was chosen 
She was the chosen, she was 
She was chosen 

I saw her crushed by god 
I saw her fall 
I saw her crushed by god 
I saw her fall 
(Chorus) 

(Chorus 2x)
