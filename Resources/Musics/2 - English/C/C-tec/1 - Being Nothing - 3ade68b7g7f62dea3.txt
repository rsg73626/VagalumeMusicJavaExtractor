BEING NOTHING

I'm not looking for friends 
I don't even remember what the word friend could mean 

Nothing ever happened to me 
For I was never there 
I have no memories 
I'm not sure I'm alive 
And I hear this voice in me 
I hear this voice in me 
It's the voice of the world 
That's shouting in my head 

You are nothing (4x) 
Nothing 

Everywhere I go, I feel unwanted 
Whatever I do, others do better 
That's why I pass through this life 
Unseen, detached, unheard 
Peaceful, silent and quiet 
Being nothing 

You are nothing (4x) 
Nothing 

Forgive me my impatience 
But I'm already gone 
I didn't want to be here anyway 
I tried in the past, I tried 
To show more ambition 
I tried in the past, I tried 
But always in vain, always in vain 

You are nothing (4x) 
Nothing 
(repeat) 

I am nothing (4x) 
Nothing
