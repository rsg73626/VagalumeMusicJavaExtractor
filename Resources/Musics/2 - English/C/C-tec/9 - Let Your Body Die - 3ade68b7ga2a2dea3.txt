LET YOUR BODY DIE

(Death is not the end) 
(Death is not the end) 

Life is boiling up and undulating 
While oblivion covers up the world 
Not to cool or comfort but to level 
The few remains of hope we still feel 

Whispers and hums are heard here and there 
Witnesses of some event to come 
Every nerve is on edge and vibrating 
Throbbing before the break of the storm 

Far away, loud and clear 
I heard a voice going in my ear 
Far away, loud and clear 
I heard a voice going in my ear 

Remain chained to the matter 
Or let your body die 
Remain chained to the matter 
Or let your body die 
DIE 

Not with you yet already abandoned 
In the dismal silence of a slough 
Mankind is in the hands of a monster 
An ogre gorging on this fallen despair 

And the voices of those yearning for light 
And their thoughts before becoming acts 
Get diverted, betrayed and distorted 
Get distracted, ignored and destroyed 

Such is the state of this convulsing world 
Such is the fate of this body of christ 
Such are the days meant to wreck and deface 
Such is the weight of the burden to bear 

Far away, loud and clear 
I heard a voice going in my ear 
Far away, loud and clear 
I heard a voice going in my ear 

Remain chained to the matter 
Or let your body die 
Remain chained to the matter 
Or let your body die 

(Your body has already done a lot of changes 
That's only the beginning 
The beginning of the new flesh) 
(2x) 

All the twists and turns of our life 
Pull us back to the place we came from 
There's no faith in our hearts of stone 
We have no torch to light up the trail 
Is it still time to make for the open ? 
Did we squander the talents we had ? 
Can we still awaken and then revive them ? 
Are they still expecting our call ? 
Are they still expecting our call ?
