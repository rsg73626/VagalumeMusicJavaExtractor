THE LOST

These are your new grounds 
You were an angel 
Here come your demons 
You are a man 

You're the one to blame 
What choice did you make 
Your pride was insane 
What side did you take 

You lost God 
You were an angel 
God lost you 
You are a man 
No pity 
You were an angel 
No mercy 
You are a man
