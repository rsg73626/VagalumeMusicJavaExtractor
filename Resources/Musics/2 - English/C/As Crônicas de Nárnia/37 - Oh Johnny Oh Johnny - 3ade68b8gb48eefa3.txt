OH JOHNNY OH JOHNNY

Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny!
How you can love
Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny!
Heavens above
You make my sad heart jump with joy
And when you're near I just can't sit still a minute
I'm so, Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny!
Please tell me dear
What makes me love you so?
You're not handsome, it's true
But when I look at you
I just, Oh, Johnny!
Oh, Johnny! Oh!
da-da-da

All the girls are crazy about a certain little lad
Although he's very very bad
He could be oh so good when he wanted to
Bad or good he understood about love & other things
For every girl in town followed him around
just to hold his hand and sing

Oh, Johnny!
Oh, Johnny Johnny!
How you can love
Oh, Johnny!
Oh, Johnny Johnny!
Heavens above, way above
You make my sad heart jump with joy
And when you're near I just can't sit still another minute
Oh, Johnny!
Oh, Johnny Johnny!
Please tell me dear
What makes me love you so?
You're not handsome, it is true
But when I look at you
I just, Oh, Johnny Johnny Johnny! My!
da-da-da

Johnny, Oh! Johnny, Oh!
Johnny, Oh! Johnny, Oh!
Johnny, Oh! Johnny, Oh!
Johnny, Oh! Johnny, Oh!

Oh Johnny! Please tell me dear
What makes me love you so?
You're not handsome it is true
But when I look at you
I just, Oh, Johnny!
