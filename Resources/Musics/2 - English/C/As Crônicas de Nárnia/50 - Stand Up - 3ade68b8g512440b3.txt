STAND UP

My head spins with a thousand lies
So many voices only one that decides
I hang my head as I change my mind
If I let you down I apologize

There's one right choice but to go wrong
There's a million ways
It gets so hard I wish I could but I can't
Run away they tell me I shouldn't love you
They stand in the way I can here the voices and they all say

Should I stand up for love
Or should I break your heart
I never knew why
Held the answers in my hands yeah
So we never let it break us down
Though I wanna run I can't quit now
Anything I do won't be enough
Unless I stand up for love

So I stand up and I stand tall
They can critisize but there not me at all
Consequence take it on the chin
Love one way we won't be giving in

One right choice that I make
Is another mans disdain
It gets so hard I thought about it
But I can't run away
They can tell me I shouldn't
Love you and try to stand in the way
But I can hear the voices and they all say

Should I stand up for love
Or should I break your heart
I never knew why
Held the answers in my hands yeah
So we never let it break us down
Though I wanna run I cant quit now
Anything I do won't be enough
Unless I stand up for love

Everything you want
Everything else seems so far
Can't get enough
(through love I am)
Yes I'm gonna fight for a
Very long space in time
Until your mine
(solider for love I am)

Should I stand up for love
Or should I break your heart
I never knew why
Held the answers in my hands yeah
So we never let it break us down
Though I wanna run I cant quit now
Anything I do won't be enough
Unless I stand up for love
