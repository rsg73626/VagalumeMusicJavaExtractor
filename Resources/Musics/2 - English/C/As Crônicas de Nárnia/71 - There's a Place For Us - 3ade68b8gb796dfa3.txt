THERE'S A PLACE FOR US

There's a place out there for us
More than just a prayer or anything we ever dreamed of
So when you feel like giving up 'cause you don't fit in down here
Fears are crashing in
Close your eyes and take my hand, yeah

We could be the kings and queens
Of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
There's a place for us

When the water meets the sky
Where your heart is free and hope comes back to life
When these broken hands are whole again
We'll find what we've been waiting for
We were made for so much more

We could be the kings and queens
Of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
There's a place for us

So hold on
Hold on
There's a place for us

We could be the kings and queens
Of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
Yeah, exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
