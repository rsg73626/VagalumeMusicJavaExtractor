SOMEONE WAKE ME UP

You're in the wrong place
At the right time
You got the wrong face
But all the right lines
Now I'm all out of phase
It's about the state of my mind
You got me sky high
Like rockets in flight
Now something in my head
Just don't feel right
Don't you go ahead and say it
Don't you go and cross this line
Don't say I love you (say I love you say I love you)
'Cause that would drive me crazy

When I see stop signs
I'm gonna run them down
When I see red lights
I'm gonna hit the ground
What you've done to me
Turning my world upside-down
Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up

Your kinda lowlife
Comes at a price
Keeps on feeding my appetite
And now you are my habit
Giving me a natural high
The more I keep on running away from you
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to do
Don't you go ahead and say it
Don't you go and cross this line
Don't say I love you (say I love you say I love you)
'Cause that would drive me crazy

When I see stop signs
I'm gonna run them down
When I see red lights
I'm gonna hit the ground
What you've done to me
Turning my world upside-down
Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up

When I see stop signs
I'm gonna run them down
When I see red lights
I'm gonna hit the ground
What you've done to me
Turning my world upside-down
Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up

How could I not see
You pulling me in
When will I see the end begin
What a fool I have been
Lift me from this state I'm in

Yeah
Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up

When I see stop signs
I'm gonna run them down
When I see red lights
I'm gonna hit the ground
What you've done to me
Turning my world upside-down
Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up
