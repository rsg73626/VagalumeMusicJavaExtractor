INSTANTLY

I'm gonna write down
What I can't say
I've gotta get these thoughts
right out some way
I know it's only been
a few short days
I'm comming from my heart
I only need today

Girl, I'm try, I'm trying
When I close my eyes
I can't stop smiling
And now I know why

Only once in a life
do you get a chance like this
I knew right from the start
I knew from the first kiss
I was chasing love
With no luck moving aimlessly
I don't need a long time
'Cause with you I fell in love instantly

Every day I smile
when I first rise
I hear your voice
I see your eyes
I'm laying down
and feeling high
It started right away
and it's here for life

Girl, I'm try, I'm trying
When I close my eyes
I can't stop smiling
And now I know why

Only once in a life
do you get a chance like this
I knew right from the start
I knew from the first kiss
I was chasing love
With no luck moving aimlessly
I don't need a long time
'Cause with you I fell in love instantly

It didn't take long
but I know it's true
I wanna spend my life
learning all of you

Only once in a life
do you get a chance like this
I knew right from the start
I knew from the first kiss
I was chasing love
With no luck moving aimlessly
I don't need a long time
'Cause with you I fell in love instantly

Only once in a life
do you get a chance like this
I knew right from the start
I knew from the first kiss
I was chasing love
With no luck moving aimlessly
I don't need a long time
'Cause with you I fell in love instantly

Instantly
