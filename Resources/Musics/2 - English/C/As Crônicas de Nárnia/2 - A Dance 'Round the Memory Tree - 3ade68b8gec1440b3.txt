A DANCE 'ROUND THE MEMORY TREE

Words we had said
Grew in my head
Colored I thought
Send me to bed

Lost memories
Grew into trees
Cover the doors
Swallow the cure

Winters have come and gone you know
Winters have come and gone you know
But I'll miss you young and free
For a dance round the memory tree

Said I forgot
But I did not
Dreams we have had
Play in my head

Did we believe
The cry of the wind?
Did we regret?
Would we forget?

Winters have come and gone you know
Winters have come and gone you know
But I'll miss you young and sweet
For a dance round the memory tree
