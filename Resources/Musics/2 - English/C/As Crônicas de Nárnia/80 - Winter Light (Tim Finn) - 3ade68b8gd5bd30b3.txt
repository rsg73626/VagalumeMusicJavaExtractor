WINTER LIGHT (TIM FINN)

It's always in the back of your mind
When everything is dark, still something shines
One chilly afternoon, you drew the blind

The earth was frozen
Ice upon the water
All at once you saw her
There in the Winter Light

Then the light came bouncin' up, from stony ground
And deep within the earth you heard the sound
Breakin' like a rock you grew profound

The earth was frozen
Ice upon the water
All at once you saw her
There in the Winter Light
There in the Winter Light
There in the Winter Light

Making everything look beautiful
Light, a child with his own fantasmagoria
Light that spills from billions of excited atoms
Light that lingers in a quiet room
Reveal for me shine for me
There in the Winter Light
Shine for me, reveal for me
There in the Winter Light
There in the Winter Light
