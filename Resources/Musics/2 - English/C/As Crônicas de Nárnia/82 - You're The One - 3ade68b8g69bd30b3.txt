YOU'RE THE ONE

I heard Your song coming over the hill
I know it seemed like the world stood still
You were singing a melody that caught me by surprise
Yeah, it souded familiar to me like I'd known it all my life

And I keep looking down as I move in closer
My heart is racing now with fear and wonder
Could I come back to You so long on my own
From where I am I know this is not my home

You're the One I believe
A king and friend has always been holding on to me
You're the One that I have seen
Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me
Just the mention of Your name and I know, I know I found love
'Cause You're the One

High in a hidden world is where You are found
Where every living thing circles around
I find myself again where I used to be
With the rescued ones falling on my knees

In Your presence there is mercy
In my fear, joy and the tears
It's Your goodness that keeps on, keeps on calling us here
Drawing us near
