LUCY

Suddenly
It all seems like a blurry dream
But I was there,
Wide awake
I lived it all

Call back to me
I'm longing for you
And my dreams to be true
When the fields bloom bright
Mountains glow
I see Him

We were there
We were kings and queens
Close to you
Wide awake
I know where I belong
But memories are strong

Call back to me
I'm longing for you
In dreams to be true
Where the fields bloom bright
Mountains glow 
I see Him

I'll call...

Where the fields bloom bright
Mountains glow
I'll see Him
I'll be back
When I hear His voice
Hear Him call
