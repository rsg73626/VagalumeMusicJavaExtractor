OPEN UP YOUR EYES

Open up your eyes
and see these warning signs
Breaking through your heart and all the reason of your mind

Open up to find
your action leaves behind
The very hope that's given for the world to feel alive

oh

Chorus
And the time has come to realize
And see the plan you've been designed for
So face the fear of all unknown
And see the heart inside
So open up your eyes
So open up your eyes

Throw yourself aside
and hear the gentle cry
Of the voice of peace that gave up all to fill the void inside

Give away the fight
release your foolish pride
the very bond is broken down you need to leave behind

oh

Chorus
And the time has come to realize
And see the plan you've been designed for
So face the fear of all unknown
And see the heart inside
So open up your eyes
So open up your eyes

open up your eyes

Can you sense the feeling that there's more than what you know? (more than what you know)
It's a fire that burns within that only seems to grow (only seems to grow)
There's a price that's given and which only love can pay
And the time is here and now, don't let it fade away

So open up your eyes, open up your eyes
So open up your eyes, open up your eyes

Chorus
And the time has come to realize
And see the plan you've been designed for
So face the fear of all unknown
And see the heart inside
So open up your eyes
So open up your eyes
