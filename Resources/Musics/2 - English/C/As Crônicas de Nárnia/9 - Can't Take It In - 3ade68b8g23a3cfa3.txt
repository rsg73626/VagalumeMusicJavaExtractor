CAN'T TAKE IT IN

Can't close my eyes
They're wide awake
Every hair on my body
Has got a thing for this place
Oh empty my heart
I've got to make room for this feeling
So much bigger than me

It couldn't be any more beautiful
I can't take it in.

Weightless in love...unraveling
For all that's to come
And all that's ever been
We're back to the board
With every shade under the sun
Let's make it a good one

It couldn't be any more beautiful 
I can't take it in.
