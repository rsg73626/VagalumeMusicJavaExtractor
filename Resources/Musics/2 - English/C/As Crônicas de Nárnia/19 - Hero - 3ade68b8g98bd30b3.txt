HERO

You broke the silence
A break in the clouds
A ray of hope in the darkness
You dusted off the steeples
Places full of fear
Full of never-ending judgement

And what is love without much risk?
You were a man of great sorrow
The world that You created
Kept You at a distance
You weren't recognizable

Chorus
Oh, You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
The impossible

You bridged the gap
You tore the veil
Almighty God in the flesh
All the plans and schemes
Against Your love would fail
In light of Your obedience

Chorus
Yeah, You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
The impossible
The impossible
The impossible

A babe cries in the night
The earth shook in awe
They echo of a man's cries
The curse undone
The curse undone
Our hero has won

Chorus
You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
The impossible

You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible
