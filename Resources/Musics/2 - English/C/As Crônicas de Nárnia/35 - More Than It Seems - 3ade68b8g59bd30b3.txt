MORE THAN IT SEEMS

Is my imagination running away
Or is all this really happening to me
Am I a prince in a far away land filled with fantasy

Where is reality and what are the actions that will define who I am?
I am holding onto the visions I've seen of what I could be
It's what I should be

[Chorus:]
More than it seems these dreams inside
(show me the way to these dreams)
Blur reality's line
('til there's nothing that's left of me)
If I could believe the dreams aside
(show me the way to these dreams)
I am capable more than it seems

Passing through darkness into my own world
Will I be more than when I left (than when I left)
Never letting go of the lessens I learned
This will make a change
A change within me

[Chorus:]
More than it seems these dreams inside
(show me the way to these dreams)
Blur reality's line
('til there's nothing that's left of me)
If I could believe the dreams aside
(show me the way to these dreams)
I am capable more than it seems

This time I won't run away
I found the strength to face life's long days
This time I won't run away

[Chorus:]
More than it seems these dreams inside
(show me the way to these dreams)
Blur reality's line
('til there's nothing that's left of me)
If I could believe the dreams aside
(show me the way to these dreams)
I am capable more than it seems

'Til there's nothing left of me
Show me the way to these dreams
