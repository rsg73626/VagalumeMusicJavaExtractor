GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT (EVERYBODY DANCE NOW)

Everybody Dance now ...
Everybody Dance now ...
Give me the music
Give me the music
Everybody Dance now ...
Everybody Dance now ...

Yeah ... Yeah ... Yeah
Everybody Dance now ...
Yeah ... Yeah ... Yeah
Everybody Dance now ...

[rap by Freedom Williams]
Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
ON the mic if it don't rhyme
Jump to the rhythm jump jump to the rhythm jump
And I'm here to provide
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make HER TWIRL
It's your world and I'm just a SQUIRREL
Trying to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, Come on say yeah,
everybody over here everybody over there
the crowd is live and I feel this groove
Party people in the house
Move ... (Left to right)
Move ... (Work me all night)

(Chorus)
Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Everybody dance now ...
Da da da da
da da da da
da da da da, da da da
da da da da, da da da

la da da da
la da da da
dum da dum da dum
everybody dance now

[rap by freedom williams]
Pause take a breath AND go for yours
On my command now hit the dance FLOOR
It`s GONNA make you sweat till you bleed
Is that DOPE enough, indeed
I pay the price, to control the dice
I'm more precise, to THE point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
And "PAW", your body is free and a whole
Dance till you can't, dance
Till you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get warm
Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya
Move ... (Left to right)
Move ... (Work me all night)

The music is my life ...
everybody dance now ...
everybody dance now ...
everybody dance now ...
everybody ...

(Repeat Chorus)
