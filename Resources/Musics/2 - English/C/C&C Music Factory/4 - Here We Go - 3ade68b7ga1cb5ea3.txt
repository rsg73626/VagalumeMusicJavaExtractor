Girls wall to wall. There's my man hanging out at the back
Till I cruise slide through the dance floor

Back to back, front to front, door to door
Everybody dance to the new sound rock and roll
Soul to soul. I bring it down.
>From the bottom to the top. From the top to the bottom.

Come on get with it. That's it.
Throw your hands in the air. Scream go! go! go!
Rock and roll will go with the flow. Yo!
Whenever you develop into a new form, break the norm,
Get warm and then swarm. Come back again.
Give it up and then transform.
>From BB King to Bo Diddly. Ed Sullivan.
Remember he sreamed to be seen with the Beatles and the Jackson Five.
The Who, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, even Oz dibbled the bit to get
rich.
