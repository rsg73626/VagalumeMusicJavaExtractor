FOREVER

I often wonder each and everyday
If I should open up would you runaway
Or would you stay here by my side in love

Time will guide us together
Find the spouse in happiness
And all I can do is hope that you feel the same
So I tell you, I tell you, I tell you
I love you and I need you
And I want you here right by my side forever, forever

My empty teardrops no longer fall
You've rescued me baby when loneliness come
So happy you're mine 'cos true love is so hard to find

Time will guide us together
Over come the differences we'll find
Then love be our guide and hope that you feeling so
So I tell you, I tell you, I tell you
I love you and I need you
And I want you here right by my side forever, forever

I need you next to me and I want you desperately
I need you next to me and I want you desperately
Forever, forever, forever

I want you next to me, I need you desperately
I want you next to me, I need you desperately
Forever, forever, forever

Together forever you and me
I Really want you desperately
Heaven above is what we'll see
We're gonna last eternally
