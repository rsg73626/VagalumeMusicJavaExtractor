TAKE A TOKE

I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you higher, higher

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked, 
take a toke but baby it's no joke
So strong it'll make you choke

Spark up the love you need in me, in me
Roll it up tight lightly
And don't let any fall down
Get rid of the slight debris between you and me
'Cause we don't need any bad seeds

Cause all of my life, baby
I've been living kind a trife, sugar
No one to guide me through
Day and night without a clue 
And I really need someone 
To point me in the right
Direction
Swing my way, Parley parley
Prove my point that I am the joint

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked, ou ou
take a toke but baby it's no joke
So strong it'll make you choke

There's no need to try to front on you, on you
I'd rather be...blunt
This much is true
Slide to the room, let's hit the boom, baby
So supersonic once you get to taste the chronic
More than you'll ever need

You'll ignite me and I'll ignite you
And once all the sheets burn, baby
I've got some more bambu
And when the smoke clears
Lady, still my eyes focus on you
Huff-n-puff some of my funk stuff
Prove my point that I am joint

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked, 
take a toke but baby it's no joke
So strong it'll make you choke
Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked, 
take a toke but baby it's no joke
So strong it'll make you choke

I like it
I love it
I need it
I want it
Got to have it

Take a toke slow or you might choke
I got the best love you ever smoked, 
take a toke but baby it's no joke
So strong it'll make you choke
