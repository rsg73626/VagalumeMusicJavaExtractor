I SEE YOU

Bored today
I'm in my way
Your not there
Wait for someone to knock
Loud on my door
I'll be scared

I say I will try
But we don't know why
I can't meet you
I can't see you
In this state of mind
I feel i'm losing time
I can't see you
I can't see you

Got nothing to say
I'm cold and i'm fake
You stay in my mind
Somehow we will join paths
And things will last
Don't turn that way

I say I will try
But we don't know why
I can't meet you
I can't see you
In this state of mind
I feel i'm losing time
I can't see you
I can't see you

Longer than ever
It's too far
And it takes all
It's like a wave
A light floats here
Instead a second thought in my head (yeah)

I say I will try
But we don't know
I can't meet you
I can't see you
In this state of mind
I feel i'm losing time
I can't see you
I can't see you
