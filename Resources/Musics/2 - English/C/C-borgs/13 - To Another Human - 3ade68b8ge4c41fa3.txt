TO ANOTHER HUMAN

Your vision of a new life was impure 
Gave into temptation and threw away what you believed 
Your immaculate state of mind was only temporary 
Your faults your flaws got the best of you 

Your commitment, your pledge to another human being 
Was destoryed through curiosity 
Your goal in life is far out of reach 
You'll find yourself out of luck 

Branded into your chest - domestic livestock 
Society kept track of your defiance 
Branded into your chest - domestic livestock 

Terror embedded into your thick mind 
Bearing your emblem with pride 
Plagued by its purpose in genesis 
Subsequently flaunting its meaning 

Your vision of a new life was impure 
Gave into temptation and threw away what you believed 

Infestation 

Roc-a-way 

Your immaculate state of mind was only temporary 
Your faults your flaws got the best of you 

Your guard was let down 
Your past turned against you
