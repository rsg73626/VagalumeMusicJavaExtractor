MY DEEPST

I wonder why the sun still sleeps ...
How many years its shine will be hide ?
This empty darkness takes it all from me
Turnin' in black these days on my side

How can i get the meaning ?
Running faster, tryin' to escape
This world is wrong, from the beginning
Your old story is just a fake ...

My deepest choice ...

Callin' your name, askin' for you
Nothin' to be heard, only my trembling voice ...
All in silence covers my dead body
In this hole, my deepest choice ...

My deepest choice ...
