MY STRENGTH

Annihilating, destroying, another town is burning
We rape, we kill, we crush and desacrate
Dead bodies and ravens around the battlefield
Conquering with violence dealers of disgrace

I am the warlord and i'll bring fear hate and fire
Die by my hand and taste my sword pain is my desire

Marching another war is starting tomorrow
Struggle for life and glory there's no tomorrow

We are vikings, predators, warmongers from the north

No mercy no prisoners in battle we have no rivals
Thorhammer is falling cancelling false religions
A roaring of thunder an unstoppable force

I am the warlord and i'll bring fear hate and fire
Die by my hand and taste my sword pain is my desire

Marching another war is starting tomorrow
Struggle for life and glory there's no tomorrow

I kill with no remorse there is no love inside my heart
No heaven to believe in i fight with axe in odin's name
I scream my battle cry there is no fear inside my heart
Valhalla is waiting for me...

Oooh there's a battle on the hills
Fight tonight when the sword shines in your hand

Battle has come stand up and fight
We kill and die in the name of a god
Armies of hate ready to strike
Thunder and blood flowing in my heart
