UNTIL SECONDS

What do you want
What do you need
Is something I have
So cold
When i'm told
Speak at a level you can understand
Write this down, remember it
For the next time I tell you off
The blood will leave your perfect face
But i'll have to tell you

Seconds till midnight
Did we get through
Seconds till midnight
Did we get through

I leave you here
To think about
The last time this happened
The first step, state your name
The second, what's your game
The system is going to work
Is it because we're all exactly the same
I'm not going anywhere
So lets get on with it

Seconds till midnight
Did we get through
Seconds till midnight
Did we get through

I can't be here
Take me to other places
Where we can be clear
And I can see other places
In this land (yeah)

Seconds till midnight
Did we get through
Seconds till midnight
Did we get through
