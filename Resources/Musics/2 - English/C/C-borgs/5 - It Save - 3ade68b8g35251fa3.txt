IT SAVE

The look on your face today
Makes me forget the past
No more, I can’t do this anymore
It only hurts our heads
Our heads

Save your heart
From breaking, from breaking
Save your heart
From breaking, from breaking

What are these rules that have been passed
Why do we even try?
Don’t even try to find me now
I’m so far gone on my flight
My flight

Save your heart
From breaking, from breaking
Save your heart
From breaking, from breaking

Save your heart
From breaking, from breaking
Save your heart
From breaking, from breaking
