FALLS

Test your head
To see if somethings good
Write on walls
To give me some kind of proof

It's easy to run away
Or else I will fall into you
It's easy to run away
Or else I will fall into you

Save your heart
That's all you have
Finish what you start
And get your empty facts

Its easy to run away
Or else I will fall into you
It's easy to run away
Or else I will fall into you

I'll be here telling no one
I'll be here falling away
Into all these spaces
Wait right here telling no one
Wait right here to show them the way
Into all these spaces

Test your head
To see if somethings good
Write on walls
To give me some kind of proof

It's easy to run away
Or else I will fall into you
It's easy to run away
Or else I will fall into you
Or else I will fall into you
Or else I will fall into you

I'll be here telling no one
I'll be here falling away
Into all these spaces
Wait right here telling no one
Wait right here to follow the way
Into all these spaces
