WE HERE

I cannot think right
It’s almost goodbye
So just be still don’t move an inch
It tears me apart
To walk away
So I will stay just one more night

How can I be so sure
I know you have me definitely
Can this be ?

We are here somehow
A glimpse of something real
I get to know how this feels
We are here somehow
Some people try too hard
You have to let down your guard

Just rest your ego
So why don’t we go
To a place to clear our minds
I lay my head down
On his broad shoulders
In this space there is no time

How did we discover
How did we uncover
Why I’ve got to have you

We are here somehow
A glimpse of something real
I get to know how this feels
We are here somehow
Some people try too hard
You have to let down your guard

I hate
That I keep having to walk away
From something I miss every day
This loneliness gives me hope
Knowing I will see you
Knowing I will see you

We are here somehow
A glimpse of something real
I get to know how this feels
We are here somehow
Some people try to hard
You have to let down your guard
