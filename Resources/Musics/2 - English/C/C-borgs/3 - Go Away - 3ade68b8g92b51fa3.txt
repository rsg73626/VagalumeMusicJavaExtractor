GO AWAY

If you go away
On this summers day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summers sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high

And the days were long
And the nights were young
And the moon stood still
For the night birds song

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail on the sun
We'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees
And worship the wind

But if you go
I'll understand
Give me just enough love to fill up my hands

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world
To start turning
Till you return again
If you ever do
What good is love
Without loing you

Can I tell you now
As you turn to gold
I'll be dying slowly
Till the next hello

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much

But if you go
I won't cry
For the good is gone
From the word goodbye

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

If you go away
As I know you must
There'd be nothing left
In this world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face

But i've been in the shadow
Of your shadow
If you might've kept me
By your side

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
