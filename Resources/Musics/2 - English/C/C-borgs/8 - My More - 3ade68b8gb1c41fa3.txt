MY MORE

I know you
You know me
Is it something in this room
That heavy feel
A weight is pressing on
The eye can let this go
Is it ideal

Do you like what you see (i've got more)
Do you like what you see (open the door)
Do you like (yeah)
Do you like (yeah, yeah)

Arrest me
Protest me
I will just give you more
You revealed it
I know you can never light up your own way
This is how we play

Do you like what you see (i've got more)
Do you like what you see (open the door)
Do you like (yeah)
Do you like (yeah, yeah)

Watch it
Face you
And chase you
And waste you away

Do you like what you see (i've got more)
Do you like what you see (open the door)
Do you like (yeah)
Do you like (yeah, yeah)
