THE INTO

We're getting here
Floating through the blue
The wind blows
My eyes close
Is it really you
A destination
A sensation
A journey through
I lie back
The same place I dreamed of you

Into the sea
Only if we go together
Into the deep
Waters where we'll stay forever

Asleep in the warm air
Next to you
The door bangs
I hear you breathing
On queue
The sun wakes
My heart shakes
Is it really you
I feel the sand
In between our hands
I'm ready to go through

Into the sea
Only if we go together
Into the deep
Waters where we'll stay forever

Protect the sea
The waters at our feet
Our legs don't tire
I look at you
You look at me
Our lives are wired
The sun wakes
My heart shakes
Is it really you
I feel the sand
In between our hands
I'm ready to go through (go through)

Into the sea
Only if we go together
Into the deep
Waters where we'll stay forever
