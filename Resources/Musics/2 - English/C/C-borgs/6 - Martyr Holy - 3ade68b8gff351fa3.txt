MARTYR HOLY

Here i pray tonight the gods of war 
To meet my end in battlefield 
The strength of hate is guiding me 
To kill and slay with no remorse 

To fight to kill for honour 
Fight and kill tonight for honour 
Fight and kill tonight for honour 
Fight and kill tonight for honour 

Metal warmonger the valkyries fly 
screaming for vengeance hear my battle cry 

Metal warmonger pleasures of the war 
Ecstasy of battle slaughterin' 'em all 

Is the road to valhalla 
kill the enemies and die 

Like a hero of a legend 
Born with a heart of a 

Metal warmonger the valkyries fly 
screaming for vengeance hear my battle cry 

Metal warmonger pleasures of the war 
Ecstasy of battle slaughterin' 'em all
