THE DARK WINGS OF HATE

The dark puts hate before me
And I feel its waves envelop me
You are the cause; you are the trigger
You are the crux for what I've come to be

Actions speak without a sound
You planted this seed inside of me
Now it's grown and in darknes,
My soul it drowns.
-this is a call to war-

The dark wings of hate wrap around me
And I'll embrace this pain
And as long as you breath
This world it is diseased
You are a cancer - a plague

Erradication - it is your only fate
And someday I will see you again
And give you back every ounce of pain
That you put on to me
And I won't need four horsemen

Only these eight limbs
To destroy you any way that I see fit
Time it passes and people change
But what you've done continues to remain

For every action, a consequence
Suffer the wrath of my vengence
Time it passes and I continue to remain
For every action you will feel my pain
