[Verse 1:]
Let's spark this
Let's get it started
Cause I see just what your watching
It's the hottness
Can't fake this
And it's making you
So flirtatious
Come mama
Keep it blazin'
So amazin'
'Til the days end
I melting cause your scorching
Hot all over
And that's important

[Pre-Hook:]
I find myself
Indulged en tu calor
I'm burning up
Girl you got me burning up
Oh ooh
You got me so caught up
I'm wanting more
I'm burning up

So naughty, let me get up on ya

Let it burn, let it burn

[Verse 2:]
Hey girl, bring the heat like Shaq
Post me up on the blocks
Cause I'm loving that back
Hey girl, your on fire
From your body, to your attire
Ami me gusta
When you freak that way
From Cali to the M.I.A
P.R. to the N.Y.C
Rep your town if it's H.O.T
