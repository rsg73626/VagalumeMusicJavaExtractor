SIN TI

[Verse 1:]
Wake Up
Don't Wanna Spend Another Moment Sleeping
I Feel Like There Are Doubts Inside Your Mind
Wondering How I Feel About You

It Seems Like
Your Searching For Some Kind Of Explanation
Or Answer To The Questions In Your Eyes
No Need To Worry I Am By Your Side

[Verse 2:]
Waiting,
For A Sign That Shows You I Am Stayin'
You Need To Know For Sure You Won't Waste Time
Doubts That Keep Casting Shadows On Our Lives
Desperate,
To Prove To You They're Really Is No Reason
For You To Feel That I Might Change My Mind
You Are The Light To My Darkest Night
