DAMELO NENA

[Chorus:]
Damelo Give It To Me Tell Me What You Need
Cause I Got To See You
Damelo Give It To Me Tell Me What You Need
Cause I Got To See You
Esa Nena Esta Tan Buena
Girl You Look Good To Me
Dime Lo Que Quieres Nena
Girl Tell Me What You Need

[Verse 1:]
What Am I Doin (What Are You Doin)
I'm Tryin To Control The Urges I Have For You
But Baby It's Not Workin
My Mind Keeps Wandering
When I'm Supposed To Be Focusing
My Boys Tell Me Stop Trippin
But They Don't Know What I'm Feelin

[B-Section:]
When I See You Mama Make Me Wanna Say (Woo Hoo)
It's Your Hips Legs Booty And Your Face (Woo Hoo)
Can't Wait To Take You Back To My Place (Woo Hoo)
Cause I Really Really Wanna Hear You Say
(Woo Hoo) (Woo Hoo) (Woo Hoo)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hold Up Bring It Back Rewind
This Girl Is One Of A Kind And I Know
I've Got To Keep Her For Sure
I'd Be Crazy As Hell If I Don't Don't Don't
Cause I Know I Won't Won't Won't
Find A Girl Like This No More (No O O O O)

[B-Section]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Aaaaay Ooooo
Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright
Alright Alright Alright Alright
Aaaaay Ooooo
Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright Alright
Alright Alright Alright Alright
Solamente Queiro Decir Que Te Necesito Ha Ti
Es Que Me Vuelvo Loco Sin Ti
I Don't Care What They Say About Me

[Chorus]
