RIGHT NEXT TO ME

Good Bye, 
It's time for me to go. 
I'll call you in the morning 
so I can let you know.
The way i really feel girl
to put your mind at ease
If i don't then who will 
if i make it i still 
Want you to be there with me

You say 
You'll love and then you'll learn
You'd learn to love me baby 
And wait till i return.
I know it hasn't been easy 
To love a man like me. 
Someday if we try 
there will be no goodbyes, 
and we will live happily. 

CHORUS
Cuz I'll be there one day 
And you will be right next to me. 
I'll be there one day 
And you will be right next to me. 

Hey there, will you be where I am? 
Will you be by myside girl, 
Or with another man? 
Just wait a little longer, 
Girl,I don't know how long. 
Just try to understand 
this is not what I planned. 
I'm sorry this had to be. 

Girl, oh girl, every man needs a woman. 
You're the woman that I choose 
And I can't afford to lose you baby. 

CHORUS
I'll be there one day 
and you will be right next to me. 
I'll be there one day 
and you will be right next to me. 

BRIDGE
I swear to the world, you'll always be my girl. 
Just say you'll be, right next to me. 
I'll be there one day
