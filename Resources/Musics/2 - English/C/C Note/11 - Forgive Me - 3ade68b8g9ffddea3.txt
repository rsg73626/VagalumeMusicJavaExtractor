FORGIVE ME

I Feel Warm From All The Light
Yet Im Still Cold Inside
Your Touch Can Take The Lonliness Away
With You Sleeping In My Arms
Wanna Keep You Safe From Harm
But I Cant Protect Our Love 
From What My Heart Has To Say
Will You Still Look The Other Way
I Cant Go On Pretending One More Day

Forgive Me
Koz I Never Meant To Hurt You
I Always Believed In Love
And I Only Wish That Was Enough
Forgive Me
Koz I Didnt Wanna Say It
But I Cant Live A Lie
Though It Breaks My Heart To Say Goodbye

As A Tear Falls From Your Eye
You Keep Asking Why
Though I Know You Felt The Answer Deep Inside
You Say Isnt This Worth Fighting For
But I Cant Fight With You At All
Time Has Changed Us Both
And I Cant Be The Man You Want Anymore
I Just Cant Look The Other Way
Why Would You Keep Pretending Another Day

Forgive Me
Koz I Never Meant To Hurt You
I Always Believed In Love
And I Only Wish That Was Enough
Forgive Me
Koz I Didnt Wanna Say It
But I Cant Live A Lie
Though It Breaks My Heart To Say Goodbye

And Though We Still Have So Much Love
We Couldnt Help But Grow Apart
Thats No Way For Us To Turn Back From Where We Are
So When We Walk Away Im Gonna Pray
That One Day You Will See

Forgive Me
Koz I Never Meant To Hurt You
I Always Believed In Love
And I Only Wish That Was Enough
Forgive Me
Koz I Didnt Wanna Say It
But I Cant Live A Lie
Though It Breaks My Heart To Say Goodbye

Forgive Me
Koz I Never Meant To Hurt You
I Always Believed In Love
And I Only Wish That Was Enough
Forgive Me
Koz I Didnt Wanna Say It
(Fade Out)
But I Cant Live A Lie
Though It Breaks My Heart To Say Goodbye
