NO ONE EVER LOVED

No one ever loved
No one ever lost as hard as I
No one ever came
No one ever saw the crystalline

In his eyes, starry sky, paradise
In his eyes, I'm in his arms
Crystalline, don't fail me now

You're the diamond in the gutter
You're the hole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn meets the light

Heaven must have known
Heaven must have laid stardust in your eyes
To shine a light across the hurt into my eyes
I see it now, the purple shrine was never mine
Oh, angel line, you fell right down

You're the diamond in the gutter
You're the hole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn meets the light

And it kills me every time
Every star will fall right down
Yeah, it kills me every time
Every star will fall right down

You're the diamond in the gutter
You're the hole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn

You're the diamond in the gutter
You're the hole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn

Every night before the dawn
Every night before the dawn
Every night before the dawn meets the light
