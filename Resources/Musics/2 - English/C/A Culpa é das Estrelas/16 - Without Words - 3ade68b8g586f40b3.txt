WITHOUT WORDS

Step outside the scene
They don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do

Not all of life is cruel
Not all of life is so untrue
Not all of life is so untrue

I can hear the morning birds
Light up on the branches
And each in turn
They sing of all God's praises
Yes, without words
Without words

Don't turn it all inside
I don't like to see you cry
I don't like to see you cry

Whispered kisses in your ears
A touch so soft and warm as to fall all clear
Confessions all of love for you
Yes, without words

Stare into the flame
'Till you see beyond the light
All the while truth was mine
It's with myself I fight
Sin you've carried like a corpse
Across your back these days
Let it fall away
Let it fall away

Let it fall away

I can hear the morning birds
So light up on the branches
And each in turn
They sing of all God's praises
Yes, without words
Without words

Without words
