ALL OF THE STARS

It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
Saw a shooting star and thought of you

Sang a lullaby by the water side and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you

You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away froom seeing you

I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

And I know the skies will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio it beats
They played "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us

Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

Then I took your hand
And through all the streets I knew
Everything led back to you

So, can you see the stars
From Amsterdam
Hear the song my heart is beating to?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

And I know the skies will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home

I can see the stars from America
