WHILE I'M ALIVE

Last night all black and white when I was sleeping
I felt shadows of emptiness around me
Just keep telling myself to live my life
Like everything else, just keep on breathing and live
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

While I'm alive
I got to I live my life
While I'm alive
The colours and the sound
While I'm alive
I got to live my life
While I'm alive

The way I looked down I was dreaming
Overhear in the sound that of a heartbeat
Keep on telling myself to live my life
Fall down like everything else
Just keep on breathing and live!

While I'm alive
I got to I live my life
While I'm alive
The colours and the sound
While I'm alive
I got to live my life
While I'm alive

While I'm alive
While I'm alive
While I'm alive
While I'm alive
While I'm alive
