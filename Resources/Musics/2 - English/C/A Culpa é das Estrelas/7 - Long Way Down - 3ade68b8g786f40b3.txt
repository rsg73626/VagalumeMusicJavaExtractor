LONG WAY DOWN

Walking on the rooftops, talking of times
With our eyes a-glowing, like the city lights
She stands on the ledge, she says, 'it looks so high'

You know it's a long way down
Feels like a long way down
Feels like a long way down, like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave
Please don't leave me now

'Cause I can feel the rivers, winding through the lands
Two lines, and a poet, like a kind old rye
You know we could talk in that language
Only we understand

But you know, it's a long way down
You know it's a long way down
It feels like a long way down
Love, it feels like a long way down
So honey don't leave, don't leave
Please don't leave me now
