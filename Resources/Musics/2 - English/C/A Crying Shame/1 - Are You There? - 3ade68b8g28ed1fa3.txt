ARE YOU THERE?

Verse
Is it your face, that i'll see when i wake up?

Is it your hands, that will pull me through again?

Is it your eyes, that i'll see when i reach the end?
when i reach the end

You've told me,
That its your face, that i'll see when i wake,
That its your hands, that will pull me through
Its your eyes, that i'll see when i reach the end.
When i reach the end, you've told me,
that you're there
