THIS LAST BREATH

This last breath, that i take,
wont leave me here.
When i die, i'll see you,
all will be clear.

Chorus:
The day is running me dry and,
answers escape my head,
life leaves me unsatisfied,
and wanting promises you said.

The day is running me dry and,
answers escape my head,
life leaves me unsatisfied,
and wanting promises you said.

Nothing fufills me, not like you do,
evil destroys me, my hope is in you!

Jesus you are my hope,
my one true hope!
