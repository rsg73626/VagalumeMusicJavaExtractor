ANGEL

Wide awake (left alone in the crowd)
Blind for you (i'm making my steps)
No, i could never be a slave (to the gore rhythm)
I beat the bloody drum myself (always watching my back)
Yeah, i'm an angel
I'm playing games
Innocent like children
Crushing the pale
Bubbles of illusion
Against those who won't play

Life to me (flashing motorways)
No turnarounds (takeover at right)
What do you call a human being (to be is to have)
If there's nothing what you can't grap (i will be something)
