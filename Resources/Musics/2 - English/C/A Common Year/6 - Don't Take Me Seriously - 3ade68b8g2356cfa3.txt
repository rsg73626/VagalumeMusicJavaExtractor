DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY

I didn't mean most
Of what I said before
So just forget that
Before it sinks to your core
I'd never want you
I'd never want you to go

I have a habit
Of opening my mouth
Before I have all
Of my facts straightened out
I'd never let you
Don't let me let you go

No, I didn't mean most
Of what I said before
So just forget that
Before it sinks to your core
I'd never want you
You'd never want me to go

You say that
I have a habit
Of opening my mouth
Before I have all
All of my facts straightened out
I'd never want to
Don't let me push you away

Don't take me seriously
If I'm acting like a fool
Don't take me seriously
It's a state I'm going through

No, it never was fair
I toss and I would turn
While you slept with a
Clean conscience without a stir
It drove me crazy and
Maybe it shouldn't have

So I would shake you
Shake you right out of your sleep
Asking you questions like
How could you do this to me?
But I should know by now
That you were better than that

Don't take me seriously
If I'm acting like a fool
Don't take me seriously
It's a state I'm going through

It's a state I'm going through
And I'm sorry too
So don't take me seriously
If I'm acting like a fool
It's a state I'm going through
