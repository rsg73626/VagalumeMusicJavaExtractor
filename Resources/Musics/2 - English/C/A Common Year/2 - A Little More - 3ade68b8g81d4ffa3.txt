A LITTLE MORE

And I remember I found out who you are
Pretending not to know was the hardest part
And back when we were younger
You'd answer all my calls
You were always close
But were you ever there at all?

Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?

In slow motion, I couldn't speak
Your words were hopeful
But honey, I can see
That some loves grow and some grow weak
You were always close, but you were never there for me

Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?

Kill me a little more with every breath you take
Kill me a little more
Kill me a little more
It takes a broken heart to know a heart can break
To know a heart can break
To know a heart can break

Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?
Were you ever there at all?

Kill me a little more with every breath you take
Kill me a little more
Kill me a little more
It takes a broken heart to know a heart can break
To know a heart can break
To know a heart can break
How could I be so blind?
How could you be so fake?
Kill me a little more
Kill me a little more
It takes a broken heart to know a heart can break
To know a heart can break
To know a heart can break
