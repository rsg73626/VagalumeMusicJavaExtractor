SHAKE IT OFF

I used to be a clean white stone
Until you saw me lying there
Stomped me into the ground
And I used to care a lot about
How the drinks affected you
Until they drowned me out

I can shake it off
And I can smile now
Because I know I laugh the last
And when you're standing there
Soak it up, soak it in
You're days of taking over
Have come to pass

You kept me there to be your fix
But it never fixed a thing for me
No, it was no cure
And I used to be okay with that
Despite the signs directing me
Away from failure

I can shake it off
And I can smile now
Because I know I laugh the last
And when you're standing there
Soak it up, soak it in
You're days of taking over
Have come to pass

I can shake it off

I can shake it off
And I can smile now
Because I know I laugh the last
(I will laugh the last)
And when you're standing there
Soak it up, soak it in
You're days of taking over
Have come to pass
