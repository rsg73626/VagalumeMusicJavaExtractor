SOLSTICE

When the sun goes away we will hide
In the warmth of a dark summer night
In the face of what we are not ready to be
We'll sing "No, it's not our time to go"

I tried to stay
As long as I could
But moments fade
And we knew they would
And for a night
I kept everyone close enough to forget
What the next day would bring

No, it's not our time to go
