EMPTY SPACE

And all I wanted this to be was simple
But matters of heart never are
And all I am is just a face
An empty space that I fill up with mortal thoughts

But who are you to say that I've lost my way?
That I never change
Not so fast

The tv's on, I'm half awake
But I can't sleep from all this knocking in my head
That I can't stop
And that reflection that I see
It isn't me
It's just a kid who's trying

But who are you to say that I've lost my way?
That I never change
Not so fast
But who are you to say that I've lost my way?
That I never change
Not so fast

Grew up too fast, people don't change
Just cover up, just rearrange
I'm finding out a lot this year
What I could be if I shake this fear

But who are you to say that I've lost my way?
That I never change
Not so fast
But who are you to say that I've lost my way?
That I never change
Not so fast
Not so fast
