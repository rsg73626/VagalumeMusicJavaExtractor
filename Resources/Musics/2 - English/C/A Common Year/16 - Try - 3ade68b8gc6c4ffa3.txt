TRY

I want to say that I already know what to do
But I've never been through a night like this without you
I'm stuck to the ceiling but I go on living
Victim to all that I'm waiting for
For you to call, for them to hear me
For a sign I can't ignore

I try but it doesn't feel right
You know I don't want to be here tonight
I'm giving you up just one more time
This isn't my home
This isn't my home
And though I hear every word that you say
You can't explain why I'm living this way
I'm giving you up just one more day
To try to find home
To try to find home

And I want to know that when I do
It's surely the right way
But it's a dark road
And when I take it, there's nothing that I'll say
To bring you there with me
Cause you won't believe it
And honestly, I barely do
There is no clear cut
No simple answers for the questions I pursue

I try but it doesn't feel right
You know I don't want to be here tonight
I'm giving you up just one more time
This isn't my home
This isn't my home
And though I hear every word that you say
You can't explain why I'm living this way
I'm giving you up just one more day
To try to find home
To try to find home

I try but it doesn't feel right
You know I don't want to be here tonight
I'm giving you up just one more time
This isn't my home
This isn't my home
And though I hear every word that you say
You can't explain why I'm living this way
I'm giving you up just one more day
To try to find home
Cause this isn't my home
This isn't my home
This isn't my home
