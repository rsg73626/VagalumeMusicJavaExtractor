TIME IS ON YOUR SIDE

Call off the guards
It's hard enough to
Get you alone as it is
Turn off the camera
And start acting natural
Let me see who you truly are

So what's the difference
Between who you are
And who you should be?
I tried my hardest
To break you out of
The shell you're hiding in

Patient love it never works out
It never grows from what you plant
The only option is acting on instinct
But even then there's no promises
You tell me "Time is on your side
Just sit back and relax
I'll call you when I've had time to think"
But I spend a day watching
I spend a day waiting
Soon I'll have nothing left to spend

So what's the difference
Between who you are
And who you should be?
I tried my hardest
To break you out of
The shell you're hiding in
