BE GOOD, BE TRUE

And I saw
Everything I needed to
And I heard
Nothing that I wanted to

And everything you said to me,
Despite my doubts,
I tried to believe
You tell me when to run away
But then you leave me all alone again

What I felt back then
Isn't true tonight
And what you said to me
Doesn't make it right
So if I don't seem genuine to you
Then maybe you should try to
Be good, be true

And I said
Everything I should to you
And I kept
Quiet when I wanted to
(speak up, speak up)

But never will I have to bite
My tongue or fake a smile anymore
You tell me when to run away
But then you leave me all alone again

What I felt back then
Isn't true tonight
And what you said to me
Doesn't make it right
So if I don't seem genuine to you
Then maybe you should try to
Be good, be true

You left me standing there that night
A pen in hand I'd use to write
You a letter
That would be my voice that you refused to hear
So take these as my parting words
And sing to them my dear

What I felt back then
Isn't true tonight
And what you said to me
Doesn't make it right
So if I don't seem genuine to you
Then maybe you should try to
Be good, be true
