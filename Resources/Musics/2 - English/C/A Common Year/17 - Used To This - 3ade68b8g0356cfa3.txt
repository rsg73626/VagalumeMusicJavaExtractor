USED TO THIS

We were caught
Dancing in the streets
While the rain put out the fires we set
The night before
And before we gave into
All the things we had avoided
I watched my inhibitions walk away

I could get used to this
Acting without thinking
Knowing that it's wrong to do
But do it anyway
I could get used to this
Diving but not sinking
Splashing into something new with you

"They'll never know," you said, "How we feel"
And I said "Honey they would never understand"
But I do believe that is what I prefer
We can only stay this high
If we let no one drag us down
So if you'd like to stay with me you should

I could get used to this
Acting without thinking
Knowing that it's wrong to do
But do it anyway
I could get used to this
Diving but not sinking
Splashing into something new with you

I'll meet you at your window
And we'll forget our age
And dive into each other
And hold our breath forever

I could get used to this
Acting without thinking
Knowing that it's wrong to do
But do it anyway
I could get used to this
Diving but not sinking
Splashing into something new with you
