AWAKE

Don't waste your time
Don't waste a minute
Believing in these wishful dreams
It never fit us well
And what at first was hard to tell
Became the sickness that directs me now

It's okay if you're awake when I come home
'Cause I need you to know
That every night I lie in bed
Trying hard to clear my head
And I pray that you see me
And how I look at you
When we are not together
And you'll never
Say the only words you could
To save yourself

Maybe you'll thank me when it's over
And maybe you'll never forgive me
We tell no lies
But secretly we hide
The silent truth of what could never be

It's okay if you're awake when I come home
'Cause I need you to know
That every night I lie in bed
Trying hard to clear my head
And I pray that you see me
And how I look at you
When we are not together
And you'll never
Say the only words you could
To save yourself
