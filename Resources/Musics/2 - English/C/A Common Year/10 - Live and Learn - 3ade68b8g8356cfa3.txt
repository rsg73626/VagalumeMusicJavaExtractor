LIVE AND LEARN

I'm starting to catch on
To what you told me
But I shrugged and laughed it off
Turned my back on you
So forgive me if you can
For all the hell I brought to you
Before I put myself through it first

No I was never proud
Just scared to lose my hold
On everything that kept me so secure
If I was wrong then you should know
That I was only watching out for those I loved
Though it didn't look that way to you

You were scaring me to death
The way you never seemed to care at all
I couldn't take the shots you took
At me for trying to affect the way
That you would end up

And I don't know where I'm going
But I'll never come home
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm never
No, I'm never coming home.
