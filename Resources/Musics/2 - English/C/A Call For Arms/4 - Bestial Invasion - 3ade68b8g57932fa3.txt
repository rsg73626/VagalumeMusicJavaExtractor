BESTIAL INVASION

Early morning, mankind sleeps
there´s a roaring in the air
inpenetrable fog
Thunder rolls and lightning strikes
hell storms, rush over the earth
but there´s no rain
Hell storms, rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion
Fog cleared up, people scream
they won´t believe that the evil takes control
Hell storms, rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion
Your time is out, obsession spreads
death rules, satans law is in command
Jesus Christ exists no longer
You better pray to the new lord
'cause he´s almighty obey him
