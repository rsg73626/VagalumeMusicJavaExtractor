AND SHINETH UNTO THE COLD COMETH

[1st Verse]
Laughter from Esharra is convincing, but unclaimed.
The last of Ka drifts across the river
- Our sky outside has not been named.
Two Ugalla-demons start their battle
- Tempest of the creek is floored in flames.
Winds of Imhullu foretold their weather
- Sea-dwelling floods reply without names.
Taste the salty tides of the Apzu
- Alight seven tablets wearing steel of lame.
Laughter from Esharra is convincing, but unclaimed.

[Chorus]
6000 years past away to let the Utu tribes hear the lying words against
Azzta's truth.
6000 years past away to let the Utu tribes hear the lying words against
Azzta's truth.
6000 years past away to let the Utu tribes hear the lying words against
Azzta's truth.
Ea's eye is the way........

[Repeat 1st Verse]

[Lead: Shaftel]

[Bridge]
We are the ones who know the mountain passes,
and we'll search the battlefields,
in order to FIND THE ESSENTIAL WEAPONS corroded within the tan dust.
Marduk, Anu, Ellil, and Ea watch us all to test our bold and drastic strength,
so Tiamat SNEERS WITH THE HATE AND COMMANDS the storm-chariot of the horses.
Their teeth and heart carry poison to strike us down,
but cannot fill our veins with venom.
We warned you twice:
"WE COMMAND THE MUSHUSSU!"
"SHARP OF TOOTH AND STRIKE OF FANG!"
"HORNED SERPENT OF THE UNCLAIMED!"
"SHINE!"

[2nd Verse]
Make a path, fix the hour, and raise the seed
The dragon's semen is what you drink to be crowned by night
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, kiss me!"
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, kiss me!"
With the billowing fog, the abyss speaks below
Your wings of force cannot warp you through the times
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, caress me!"
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, caress me!"
In the ninth aeon, Esharra ceases the laughter
Then, Imhulla assembles the blazing cycllone
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, embrace me!"
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, embrace me!"
Now you are spiritually drunk from the dragon's semen,
So set your arrow in the bow and coat it with the poison
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, clutch me!"
"Belet-ili, O great pythoness, clutch me!"
...AND SHINETH UNTO THE COLD COMETH...
