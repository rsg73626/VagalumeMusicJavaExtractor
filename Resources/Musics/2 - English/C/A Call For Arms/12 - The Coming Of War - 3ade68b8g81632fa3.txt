THE COMING OF WAR

Evil
Summoned to war
Eternal conquest for power
Gathering armies of death
To fight and kill at will
Sinister weapons of war
Piercing metal and man
Warriors
Mounted on steeds
Ride out into the mist
Awaiting
The signal to attack
Swords clash and men fall to their death
Aimless pawn
Only to die by my hand
Battle cry
Blood stains upon his chest
Endless
Eternal Pain
Thousands die for a king
Wretched
Weary souls
Raging battle never ends
Hatred
Inflicting death
Destroying the weak at heart
Eternity
Becomes less
War has drawn to an end
Overthrown
The emperor falls in defeat
Great halls
Crack and decay with neglect
Dethroned
He cries out in vengeance
Impaler
Mark is words of death
Shadows
Crusades of the past
Triumph through the fog
Sunsets drip into dusk
Flows like blood on my blade
Massacre the feckless breed
Dismiss all empty thrones
Riding, beyond the clouds, damnation ends in despair
Awaiting
The signal to attack
Swords clash and men fall to their death
Aimless pawn
Only to die by my hand
Battle cry
Blood stains upon his chest
