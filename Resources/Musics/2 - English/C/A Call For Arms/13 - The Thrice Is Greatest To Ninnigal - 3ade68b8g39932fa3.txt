THE THRICE IS GREATEST TO NINNIGAL

The detestable xul
Is chained to Ninnigal
Acknowledge the prayers
Subsequent to earth
The seventh gate of Nana-
'Outcry thy sin!',
While the sixth portal of Lord Mastema opens wide.
Nana: God of the Moon: I convoke to thee.
Our terra firma regrets burning the scriptures
An abyss will seek menace towards the reign once again.
Ostentation of your heart is
A heart filled with lunar parallaxes
If you look,
The elders anticipate the arrival
...Of the black and amoral innocents
If you look,
The Celestial Pantheon will burn
...Burns the prediction of persecution
