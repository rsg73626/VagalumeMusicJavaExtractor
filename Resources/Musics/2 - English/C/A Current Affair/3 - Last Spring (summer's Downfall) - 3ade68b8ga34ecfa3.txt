LAST SPRING (SUMMER'S DOWNFALL)

It's alright, all you gotta do now,
Is get your heart back home.
It's not what you did but what your gonna do.
I told you I'd get out of this alive.
But you know how that goes...

Because, I've been there,
And I'm telling you it's a choice.
(Oh, so you know.)
You know exactly what it's like.

Here comes the light, shining through,
Burning holes through doubt.
I didn't want to be here for this.
Why would you want to be here?
After all, there isn't life,
Isn't life without Him.
Your color's fading in the dark.
And I just want to be here for you,
Just got to listen to me.
Because after all, you know just what it's like.
You know just what it's...

I don't want to keep on living,
Up to other people's standards,
It's just not who I am.
I need your loving arms around me,
Embracing my deepest flaws,
Yeah, my deepest flaws.

So give me the strength and the knowledge,
To know exactly what goes on.

Here comes the light, shining through,
Burning holes through doubt.
I didn't want to be here for this.
Why would you want to be here?
After all, there isn't life,
Isn't life without Him.
Your color's fading in the dark.
And I just want to be here for you,
Just got to listen to me.
Because after all, you know just what it's like.
You know just what it's...

I've been, I've been staying up,
For this saying for so long.
I've been, I've been staying up,
For this saying for so long.
What I was thinking,
What I was doing.
No, I'm not there,
And it's not fair.

So give me the strength and the knowledge,
To know exactly what goes on.

Here comes the light, shining through,
Burning holes through doubt.
I didn't want to be here for this.
Why would you want to be here?
After all, there isn't life,
Isn't life without Him.
Your color's fading in the dark.
And I just want to be here for you,
Just got to listen to me.
Because after all, you know just what it's like.
You know just what it, what it's like.
