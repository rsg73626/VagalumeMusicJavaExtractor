LOVE ONE ANOTHER

Cause as this world.
As it keeps on spinning.
My mind becomes.
Dizzier as it goes.
Can't seem to find my space.
Or find my place, to fit in.
This life, goes quicker than you know.

Happiness is getting farther from the point.

Cause as the rain comes drizzling down.
My heart beat's still the sound.
Of singing for you.
And I really wish.
That times can be like this.
Everyday.
We need to forget about this.
Hourglass that controls the way we live.
So we, so we can learn to.

Love one another.
Like a brother.
Everybody should have known.
This life's perception.
Happiness is getting farther from the point.

Coming down on me.
And I feel the weight on my shoulders.
Coming down on me.

And so much weight.
I can't seem to stand up.
And tend for myself anymore.

Love one another.
Like a brother.
Everybody should have known.
This life's perception.
Happiness is getting farther from the.

Love one another.
Like a brother.
Everybody should have known.
This life's perception.
Happiness is getting farther from the point.
Oh. From the point.

Love one another.
Like a brother.
Everybody should of known
This life's perception.
Happiness is ...
