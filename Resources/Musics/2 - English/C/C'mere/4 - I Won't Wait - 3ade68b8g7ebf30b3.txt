I WON'T WAIT

Full of emptiness
Bloody missing the past
All the things you said
Cannot erase your acts

You came to me, you touched my skin
You stole my breathe and you made me sink
But now I see the space between you and me
starts to disappear

I won't wait, I won't wait now
Tonight is your last chance to get in my way
I won't waste my whole life waiting for the day
I won't wait

You look so heartless
You're not giving your best
Inside my head a mess
I keep on rolling in my bed

I cannot sleep, I cannot dream
I cannot live, I can't neither think
But now I see the space between you and me
starts to disappear

I won't wait, I won't wait now
Tonight is your last chance to get in my way
I won't waste my whole life waiting for the day
I won't wait

And if you want to hear my voice, you got my number
And if you want to see me now, just wish it harder
And I'll be there right on time

You came to me, you touched my skin
You stole my breathe and you made me sink
But now I see the space between you and me
starts to disappear

I won't wait, I won't wait now
Tonight is your last chance to get in my way
I won't waste my whole life waiting for the day
I won't wait
