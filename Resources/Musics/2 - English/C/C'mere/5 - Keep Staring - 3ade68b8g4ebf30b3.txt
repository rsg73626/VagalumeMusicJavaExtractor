KEEP STARING

I see the stars, they tell me your name
They look so glad but they're fading away
They've got the shine of your bright eyes
They want to hypnotize me
Through me in your life

But now it's getting so hard, it's getting so cold
it's getting so dark
It's getting close, It's getting so alone
And I just want to be with you
I just need to be with you
I just have to be with you

Cause now
The world is changing so fast
There's no time to look into the past
Gotta do this, gotta do that
But I just wanna look at you and keep staring

Now I can see closer and clearer
The life I planned to live has just disappeared
I hold your hand and touch your warm heart
I'll never let you down and falling apart

But now it's getting so hard, it's getting so cold
it's getting so dark
It's getting close, It's getting so alone
And I just want to be with you
I just need to be with you
I just have to be with you

Cause now
The world is changing so fast
There's no time to look into the past
Gotta do this, gotta do that
But I just wanna look at you and keep staring
