FANTASTIC BORING SONG

Time goes by so slowly now, I can feel the earth go around

Inertia wants to through me away
But here's the place where I belong
Although I'll lose myself someday
Now gravity remains strong

Should I go now or should I stay?
Hesitancy in going wrong
I'm always searching a gateway
So sick and tired to drift along

I'll light up, and rock up, believe this is my faith
I'll stand up, and make up, don't let me fade away

I missed the north I lost control
now I'm going towards a black hole

There's nothing to lean me on
A little dizzy feels confound
Seems that the gravity is gone
My feet no longer touch the ground

Losing my senses feeling strange
Getting far too close to the limb
Land now is so far out of range
And future's looking pretty dim

I'll light up, and rock up, believe this is my faith
I'll stand up, and make up, don't let me fade away

Meteoroids are colliding down
we may not get out of this drown

The end is close there's no way out
We should sit down and watch it burn
The hours now are to be flout
And some more minutes to be yearn

Inertia wants to through me away
But here's the place where I belong
I wasn't sure of what to say
Wrote this fantastic boring song
