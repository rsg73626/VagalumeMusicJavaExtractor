NEAR AND FAR

I'd like to stay, but I gotta go away
I wish you'd say for me to wait
By you side and so dry you tears

I think it's wrong to take so long
For you to show what we both know
You feel for me everyone can see it in your eyes

If you only give me a sign that you are mine I'll be with you

And I think we're
Wasting time thinking about that
We could just be together and live forever love
Cause you know that I am yours and
You know you're mine
But it's always the same old thing
You come to me and run

Are you fine?
Do you think it's right?
But it's in time to change your mind
And try to fix something deeper than you think

If you only give me a sign that you are mine I'll help you to try

And I think we're
Wasting time thinking about that
We could just be together and live forever love
Cause you know that I am yours and
You know you're mine
But it's always the same old thing
You come to me and run

You held my hand under the table and I went high
You're so near but you're so far at the same time

If you only give me a sign that you are mine I'll be with you
