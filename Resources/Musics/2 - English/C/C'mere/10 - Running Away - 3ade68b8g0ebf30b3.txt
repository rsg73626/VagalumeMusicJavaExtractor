RUNNING AWAY

Why does it has to be so hard
Live all time with sparks of life
Looking for the words to say
All the things inside my heart

Oh that time is not the same
From there many thing have changed
I didn't broke my word that day
When I said that I would stay

And now that everything is coming up
I thought that you were growing up
I've only asked you to look up at me
And see
The man
In me

And that's the reason for I run
I run far away
To anywhere
Where I can stay

And that's the reason for I run
I run far away
To anywhere
Where I'll be safe

I've always thought that I was lucky
But luck is so relative
When I said that it was perfect
There was something inside of me

Saying that was not the same
And when I lay down in my bed
I remember you face
And my world turns into sad
