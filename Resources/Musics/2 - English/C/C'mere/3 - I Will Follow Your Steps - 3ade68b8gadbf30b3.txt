I WILL FOLLOW YOUR STEPS

In the happiest days, in the darkest nights
Pretend I'm ok, although I'm not
It's always the same, when you're not around
That's why I tell you, leave steps on the ground

I'll follows your steps
Over the sand

I must admit, although didn't want
When you came to me, released all the knots
And if you're beside me, you leave me no air
I just want to dive in, get drowned in your head
And if you're not here, I am in free fall
I must get away from here and reach you all around

I'll follow your steps
Over the sand

I will follow you (every day, every night, every time, everywhere)

I'll follow your steps
Over the sand

I will follow you!

Every day, every night, every time, everywhere
