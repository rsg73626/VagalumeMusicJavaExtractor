SUNLIGHT

I feel alone, I feel so strong
I'm feeling something I don't know
I'm feeling down, I look around
There's something wrong I haven't found

Everytime you find the way to go
Know how hard is walk this path alone

I believe that sunlight will come for us tomorrow
And wash away all our pain
I believe that sunlight will come for us tomorrow
And finally take the darkness away

Everytime you find the way to go
Know how hard is walk this path alone

I want to go, I gotta go
To a place where I'm not sure
And all the stones are in my way
I'll take'em and throw away

Everytime you find the way to go
Know how hard is walk this path alone

I believe that sunlight will come for us tomorrow
And wash away all our pain
I believe that sunlight will come for us tomorrow
And finally take the darkness away
