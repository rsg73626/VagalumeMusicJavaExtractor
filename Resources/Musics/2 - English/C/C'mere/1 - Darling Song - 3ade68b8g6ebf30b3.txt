DARLING SONG

I'd like to say what I'm feeling for you now
But I don't know the way how
So please understand all the feelings inside myself
It's hard to find the words in my head

And if you want to know how long is this feeling
Just count the stars in sky
Cause it's so hard to show with the right meaning in words
what is inside my heart

Darling you're everything
all the way I look it's only you I see
Darling you're all I need
in the night you're always shining in my dreams

You're always beautiful
In your eyes I see the tenderness of a girl
Your honey lips, your bright skin
Your smile takes me far from here

And if you want to know how long is this feeling
Just count the stars in sky
Cause it's so hard to show with the right meaning in words
what is inside my heart

Darling you're everything
all the way I look it's only you I see
Darling you're all I need
in the night you're always shining in my dreams

Take your hands in mine, hold you near me
Get into you heart, if you only give this chance to me

And if you want to know how long is this feeling
Just count the stars in sky
Cause it's so hard to show with the right meaning in words
what is inside my heart

Darling you're everything, all the way I look it's only you I see
Darling you're all I need
in the night you're always shining in my dreams
