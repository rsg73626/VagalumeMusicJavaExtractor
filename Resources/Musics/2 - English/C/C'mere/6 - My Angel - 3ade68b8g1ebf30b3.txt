MY ANGEL

Suddenly appears in my life
And honestly changes it for better
I don't know where did you come from
But seriously it doesn't matter


I just want to know your name
I love you so, I won't forget

My angel came from heaven
To take away all my fears
Spread your wings and take me to a flight
I want you here with me
Up above and high
higher

There a choice that you have to make
Stay here please now and forever
I don't want you to leave me now
You don't have to get back to heaven
099
I just want to know your name
I love you so, I won't forget

My angel came from heaven
To take away all my fears
Spread your wings and take me to a flight
I want you here with me
Up above and high
higher

I would go to anywhere
Be near you that's what really cares
In heaven or in hell
You make me feel so well
