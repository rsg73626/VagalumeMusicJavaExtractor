PLATONIC

Starts on Monday morning
Lasts until late afternoon
Knowing you a better way
Made me fall in love with you

And it's always late at night
When I think of you the most
In everything I wanna say to you
Which probably I won't

See your smile and make you laugh
Gets me higher than the moon
Fires a spark inside my heart
Ignites my love for you

And I know that won't be easy
For us to be together
But if you say yes to me
It will last forever

My heart is over your hands now
I cannot help my heart is over your hands now

I want you to know
I need you here with me
You're the only one I want
I want you so
If you give your hands to me
I'll never let it go

My heart will not give up
My heart will never give up on you
It is quite complicated
To tell you how I feel
I don't know what you will think
But believe me this is real

You may not understand it
Say that it was too fast
But was sudden like a storm
And stronger than a blast

There's a mess inside my head
And an anguish in my heart
Seems that destiny's conspiring
We can't avoid to be apart

In the end it's all or nothing
And decide to take the chance
Live your princess fairy tale
Happy ending at last

My heart is over your hands now
I cannot help my heart is over your hands now

I want you to know
I need you here with me
You're the only one I want
I want you so
If you give your hands to me
I'll never let it go

My heart will not give up
My heart will never give up on you
