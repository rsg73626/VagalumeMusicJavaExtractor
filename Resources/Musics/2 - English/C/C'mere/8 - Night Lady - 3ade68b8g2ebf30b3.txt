NIGHT LADY

Uma orquídea rara, entre um mar de rosas
Que Deus escolheu para o mundo perfumar
Abelha rainha, minha estrela guia
Que na noite escura vem me visitar

You and me were in your dream
Why can't we try and see what could be
You and me how can't you see
That I was made for you and you were made for me

Nos teus olhos vejo a lua, sinto o mel da boca sua
E sei onde eu quero estar
Sua voz paralisante, tão suave e penetrante
Flutua pelo ar

You and me were in your dream
Why can't we try and see what could be
You and me how can't you see
That I was made for you and you were made for me

Essa música foi feita para você
Pois a muito tempo eu quero te dizer

You and me were in your dream
Why can't we try and see what could be
You and me how can't you see
That I was made for you and you were made for me
