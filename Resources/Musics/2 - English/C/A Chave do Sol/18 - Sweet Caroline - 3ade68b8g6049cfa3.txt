SWEET CAROLINE

I don´t care where lies the fault
Who is guilty, baby?
If it´s you who started

You don´t know anything
You don´t care for what you need
When you find the answers
Maybe your heart returns to see

Oh, sweet caroline
I wanna feel your heart, baby
Sweet caroline
I wanna feel your heart, baby

I´ll do anything
Wherever you are
I´m coming ´round to see you
Kicking down the doors to your heart

I don´t know what you need
Baby, i want you right by my side
´cos you´re the only one
Who keeps me satisfied
