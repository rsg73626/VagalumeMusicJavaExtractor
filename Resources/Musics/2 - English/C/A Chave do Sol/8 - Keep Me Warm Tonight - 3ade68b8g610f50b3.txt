KEEP ME WARM TONIGHT

Still seeing your eyes
Still feeling your lips
And I know I still love you
I'll love you for a long, long time

Can't forget your kisses
How can I forget you
And I know I still love you
I'll love you for a long, long time

You don't know how much you hurt me baby
You don't know how much
You never, never ever tried to make a life by my side
You don't know how much I've been hurt by you, baby

But love is blind
Cos' hard to see the danger
In a woman who makes love like you
And I'm afraid I won't be able to forget you

I want you hold me tight
And keep me warm tonight
I want you hold me tight
And keep me warm tonight

Still feeling your breasts
I can't forget your legs, baby
And I know I still love you
I'll love you for a long, long time

You don't know how much you hurt me baby
You don't know how much
You never, never ever tried to make a life by my side
I felt you were only playing games with my heart baby

But love is blind
Cos' hard to see the danger
In a woman who makes love like you
And I'm afraid I won't be able to forget you

I want you hold me tight
And keep me warm tonight
I want you hold me tight
And keep me warm tonight
Yeah, hey yeah!

I want you hold me tight
And keep me warm tonight
I want you hold me tight
And keep me warm tonight
