EVERYTHING

This time I realize you're looking this way with your real eyes. 

You're the beat that cant stop, 
the peak of plot, 
the deep in my thought, 
the time on my watch. 
You're the air that I breathe, 
the world that I see, you are. 

I could never find a way or right things to say, 
I guess I just didn't know how. 

You see the longer that we wait, the more time things could take, 
I guess I'll have to spell it out... 

You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G 
Everywhere, everytime, everything.

You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G 
Everywhere, everytime, everything. 

(Girl I can't stop) 
Girl I can't stop thinking about anyone else but you. 

You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G 
Everywhere, everytime, everything.
