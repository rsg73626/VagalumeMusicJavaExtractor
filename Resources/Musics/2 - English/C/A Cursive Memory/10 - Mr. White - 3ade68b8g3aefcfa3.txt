MR. WHITE

Get out the candlelight
I'll strike the light to watch them ignite
Why are people so frantic when they are so romantic
Why are people in pain when we can boogie and shake
You see we're worn down
We're worn down and everyone else in town
You're worn down everyone else in town
I'm worn down everyone else in town

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present

It's time to tone it down
It's time to dim the lights
Get up, get out, you're embarrassed

We'll call it magic
No, no let's call it plastic
We'll get together and make history
(It's a mystery)
It's a mystery
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It's a mystery

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present

Ah, ah, ah, ah
It's a mystery

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
