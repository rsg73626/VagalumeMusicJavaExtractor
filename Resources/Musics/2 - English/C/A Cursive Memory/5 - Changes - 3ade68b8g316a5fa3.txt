CHANGES

Close your eyes
Watch it all
Pass us as we know
Cause everything
In this world
Is here today and gone tommorrow

So get up and get down
And everybody crowd around
Cause this is the sound
Get up and get down
And everybody crowd around
Cause we're gettin down

Stop and try
To figure out
What change never stops
You realize
That all the change
It won't ever drop

So listen up
And listen now
And everybody crowd around
Cause this is the sound
Get up and get down
And everybody crowd around
Cause we're gettin down

Changes changes
We'll always change in life
Goes in stages
Changes changes
Nobody knows life
Jumps and goes 

We're moving on and on 
We're moving on and on and on

We're moving on and on 
We're moving on and on and on

Changes changes
We'll always change in life
Goes in stages
Changes changes
Nobody knows life
Jumps and goes
