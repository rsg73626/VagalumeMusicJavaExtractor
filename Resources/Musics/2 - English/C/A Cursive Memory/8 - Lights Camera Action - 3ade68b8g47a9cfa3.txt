LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION

[Shaun]
This is when the best act in town

[Colin]
Like ashes to ashes they all fall down

[Shaun]
We'll all come and watch the play today

[Colin]
And pray for this day

[Shaun]
We'll start two, one on my count
We'll start that count right about now
Three two one

[Shaun]
Alright lets make something clear

[Colin]
I'm the star and I'm the only star that's here

[Shaun]
The only one that would give it his all

[Colin]
The only one that takes the fall

[Shaun]
It's time to perform to thousands looking on and on at you
Now that we're ready to for my go
Ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show

[Colin]
And we all have a dream
In every act and every scene
Well there's got to be a star
And I'm the only star so far

Ring around the rosies with pockets full of posies
Step backwards backwards backwards and we'll stay off the ground 

And she screams like a bullet going through a forest of trees
And she begs for forgiveness when it went straight through her bottom teeth

[Shaun]
It's time to perform to thounsands looking on and on at you
Now that we're ready for my go
Ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show

[Colin]
And we all have a dream
In every act and every scene
Well there's got to be a star
And I'm the only star so far

Ring around the rosies with pockets full of posies
Step backwards backwards backwards and we'll stay off the ground 

[Shaun]
It's time to perform to thounsands looking on and on at you
Now that we're ready for my go
Ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show

[Colin]
Ring around the rosies with pockets full of posies
Step backwards backwards backwards and we'll stay off the ground
