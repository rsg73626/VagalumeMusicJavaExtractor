INTO THE SEA

And it's alright, it's alright
And it's alright, it's alright
Everybody is a failure in this light
And it's okay, it's okay
And it's okay, it's okay
Underneath it nobody's back is straight

And I tried to stop it when
I saw your posture start to bend
But honey it was not mine to lift

Go throw yourself into the sea
Go throw yourself into
Throw yourself into the sea

And it's alright, it's alright
And it's alright
I can't make it right
Somebody put a bad lens in your eye
And you try to shed your skin
When you saw yourself in it so thin
But you only shed your blood
When you climb out, you can't climb back in

Go throw yourself into the sea
Go you throw yourself into the sea
Though we don't need a mountain moved
We just want to move ourselves
Take us somewhere, take us somewhere
Anywhere else

Go throw yourself into the sea
Go throw yourself into the sea

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

Go throw yourself into the sea
Go throw yourself into the sea
Though we don't ever see you move,
slowly the wind turns you to sand
in the hands of children on the shore.
