BLOODSUCKER PT. II

well, it's yours
you can have it if it means that much to you
don't let me stop you
don't let me stop you now
<i>[x2]</i>

and stretch me out across the table
and turn my insides out
turn me into someone else
someone more like yourself

and stretch me out
but bother not with ties, I promise to lie 
perfectly still
And I swear, I swear not to scream
at my becoming part of the machine

well, it's yours
you can have it if it means that much to you
don't let me stop you
don't let me stop you now

but let it be known that this is what you'll get
for falling out of line, and no one wins 
and no one wins against the machine
so get back, get back in line

are you the man now
that you got what you wanted
are you the man now
that you got it
<i>[x2]</i>
