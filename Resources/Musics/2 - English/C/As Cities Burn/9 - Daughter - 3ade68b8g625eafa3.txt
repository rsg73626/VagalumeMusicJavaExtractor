DAUGHTER

It's a shame what I thought of her
when I saw her that way.
It didn't change what you thought of her.
She's been your daughter since she was made.

Since I was made, I've been leaving.
I'd say I'd change but I wouldn't believe it.
It's 'cause my legs, they don't forget.
When they find a way out, they'll always take it.

Oooh we don't
Nooh we don't
we don't know how we got here,
the way is overgrown.
Oooh we don't
Nooh we don't
we don't know how we became this.

She has a name but I don't have to know
'cause all I'm after is all she has to show.
We cannot save, we can't even slow
our loss of innocence every new child has to grow.

Oooh we don't
Nooh we don't
we don't know how we got here,
the way is overgrown.
Oooh we don't
Nooh we don't
we don't know how we became this.
