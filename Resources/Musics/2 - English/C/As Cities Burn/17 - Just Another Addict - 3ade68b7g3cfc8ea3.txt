JUST ANOTHER ADDICT

if something said could serve as thread to her wound
i'd commit to it
i'd tell my tongue to tell of it until it broke my jaw
until she saw
that from the bottles we break
her reflections make
in this sea of glass, will she see at last the girl i've seen all along
such beauty, a prize
she's closed her own eyes to such value
a truth, a truth

[x2]

i'm just another addict with a different kind of needle in my arm
another bottle in my hand
brings a thought to understand that we're all drunk
walking the narrowest white lines ever drawn
going further than we've ever gone

[x2]

we fall just to feel recovery
we stumble into something sobering
i've found it overflowing from the cup of God
