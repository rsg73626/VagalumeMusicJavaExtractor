WAKE DEAD MAN, WAKE

let the dead bury their own dead

will you still love me in famine
as when love began at the harvest
or would you gain the whole world
son, I love you at your darkest
but what good is the whole world
when I promise no tomorrow
I only promise your tomorrows
will never take you past my palm

love, what is love without trust
at my word would you bring your isaac

son, I loved you at your darkest
