THE NOTHING THAT KILLS

and i will hold
i will hold your head above the water
while the current pulls me under
as long as you have breath, my dear
i will dance with death

and i will hang my life in the space between
the noose and your neck
and i won't let you die just yet

i will love you even when you won't let me
and you will kill me by doing nothing
(nothing, nothing)
but i know it's not you, my dear, i know it's not you
i know it's not you, my dear
it's the nothing that kills

i can't save you
control is something out of mine
no i can't save you
control is something out of my control

i will love you even when you won't let me
and you will kill me by doing nothing
but i know it's not you, my dear, i know it's not you
i know it's not you, my dear
it's the nothing that kills
nothing

i can't save you, but i will love you
i can't save you, but i will love you
i can't save you, but i will love you
i can't save you
but i will love you
i like to think that this is love
lost in second chances without end
this is romance
this is romance
