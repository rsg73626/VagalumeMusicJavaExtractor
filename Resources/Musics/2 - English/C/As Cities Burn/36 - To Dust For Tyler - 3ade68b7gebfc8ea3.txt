TO DUST FOR TYLER

a fist through the wall never solved anything
it just worried mom
just like the bullets down the barrel of growing up

this must be home where mothers abandon their young
and fathers are further than the faintest star
we are family

we'd return to dust if it meant saving you
if it's of any use, lay me beneath your feet
and breathe deep these fumes
from this machine of healing hearts
we built it through the night
we built it through the night

this could be home if son could see what he's done
and that mater is closer to a son so far from what
we are family

we'd return to dust if it meant saving you
if it's of any use, lay me beneath your feet
and breathe deep these fumes
from this machine of healing hearts
we built it through the night
we built it through the night

tyler, we'll fight this world together
and our own strengths, they also die together
but my prayer is that you'll trust God's wings which shelter me
because in a world of nothing
they are everything

night
we built it through the night
we built it
we built it through the night
we built it through the night
