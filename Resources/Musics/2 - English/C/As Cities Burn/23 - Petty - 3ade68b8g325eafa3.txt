PETTY

Is this it at the top?
I didn't know there was not a ceiling
Or that the air up here was so thin
I just want my wanting to stop
I know you warned us of drought
We didn't believe it
Now we can't keep water from freezing

You are just in time to move aside
No one ever comes here stays for long
You're gonna be dethroned
You're gonna shed your pride
Overgrown

There's a kid on the cover
And I know that he doesn't believe
In the misery that he sings
Yeah it's just what he thinks he needs

If all the world's a stage then it's not mine
'Cause no one ever stays on you for long
You're gonna be dethroned
You're gonna shed your pride
It keeps growing

And you are just in time to move aside
No one ever comes here stays for long
You're gonna be dethroned
You're gonna shed your pride

If all the world's a stage then it's not mine
'Cause no one ever stays on you for long
Yeah you're gonna be dethroned
You're gonna shed your pride
Overgrown.
