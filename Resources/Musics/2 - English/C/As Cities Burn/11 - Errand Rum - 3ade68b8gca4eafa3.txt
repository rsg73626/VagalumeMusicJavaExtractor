ERRAND RUM

No, I won't play that song,
to hear you singing it back.
It is all wrong.
If I ever told the truth,
he was never dead, at least not to you.
But you still sing, you still do.

We are so young.
We are so young now.
Hold your head up for the world to spin around.

Old friend we used to talk.
What we used to say, I can't recall.
Was I really listening?
Or was I just waiting for my turn to talk?
I got everything to say too.

We are so young.
We are so young now.
Hold your head up, baby soon I'll be around.

Round and round we go we go.
Round and round we go we go,
and round and round we go we go.
(I know you hate the sound but baby I can't stop 'em)
Round and round we go.

We are so young.
We are so young now.
Hold your head up for the world to spin around.

We are so young.
We are so young now.
Hold your hands out for what we can't pull down.
