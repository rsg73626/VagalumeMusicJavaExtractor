A BREATH OF WATER

i would be one of them and wouldn't feel so alone

currents grind and scales shine
upon a watery way down
shorelines are far from here
but i don't need them at all
just our hands and our eyes
as we walk upon the waterline
and how could i have looked away from you
to watch the divers dive
to watch the divers die
if i could just breathe water
i would be one of them and wouldn't feel so alone
but i was never one for fitting in
because i know i'm still a world away from home
this abyss, it's endless

[x2]

across sea tops to ocean shores
i'm not exactly sure where we're headed
but i could care less
because i am weightless

[x2]

if i could just breathe water
i would be one of them and wouldn't feel so alone
but i was never one for fitting in
because i know i'm still a world away from home
this abyss, it's endless
