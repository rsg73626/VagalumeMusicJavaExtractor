THE NEW IN BLOOM

in slaying myself i will start now
in slaying myself i will start now
i am run by the use of my own hand's knife
to kill the life i've held too tight
i dress me in maroon
the new is in bloom

this knife, the life i have in you, runs me through
this knife, the life i have in you, runs me through
into the new bloom

how are you so string to hold me in your arms
while i sink this into your back
is it that so we could be
your hands were nailed to me
your hands were nailed to me

in slaying myself i will start
in slaying myself i will start
in slaying myself i will start
in slaying myself i will start
in slaying myself i will start now
in slaying myself i will start now

your hands were nailed to me
your hands were nailed to me
this knife, the life i have in you, runs me through
