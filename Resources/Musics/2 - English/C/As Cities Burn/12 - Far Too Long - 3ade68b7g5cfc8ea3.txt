FAR TOO LONG

wasting away in his room alone
as thoughts carry him back
back to a place called home
where has daddy gone
one could only wish he knew
as the questions pile up
the memories are few

on the day he turned seven years old
he waited by the mailbox in the cold
watching from the window
mom fears the broken heart of her son
as he waited for the birthday card
that was never gonna come

it's been far too long
where has daddy gone
and does he miss him
nothing can replace
what we never had
where are you dad

now the years have been spent
and he's a little older
those days by the mailbox
all seem a little colder
he learned it's just life
when daddy won't stay
but he promised himself
he'd be a better father someday

it's been far too long
where has daddy gone
and does he miss him
nothing can replace
what we never had
where are you dad

he takes a step outside and reaches to the sky
he's touched by his father for the very first time
he breathes in new life as the sun disappears
returning tomorrow to burn away his fears

reaching to the sky
holding his head high
