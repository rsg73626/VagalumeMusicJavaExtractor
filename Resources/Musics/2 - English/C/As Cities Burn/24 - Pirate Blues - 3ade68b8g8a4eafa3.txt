PIRATE BLUES

Before you, your mom and your dad used to smoke in the texas sun.
They were young once too.
And your mom she found Jesus,
while your old man stepped out and drew up his veins.

It's quiet in the house of the old.
You can hear through grinding teeth, clocks taking their tool.
'Cause time has a mind of its own,
like our sun spinning around.
It wont slow for you now.

Oh I wanna catch in a song,
notes I dont hear yet.
But I will when im gone.

I've been pouring my heart up,
up through the floor boards,
but you don't live here anymore.

Oh you wanna catch in a lens, 
color your green eyes don't see just yet.

The horse man,
they all blow out their torches.
I can still see you shining out.
But you sleep in a bed for a giant,
while you wait for your love to come home.
But you dont know, she's not coming back.

Oh I wanna find out im wrong.
And every road leads us home.
Oh but I'll never know, 'cause I keep my eyes closed 
and only go where I've been before

Oh say you dont know, if you dont.
