GATES

I've been looking for a new course
A different way to say your name, to hear your voice
I've gotta find new chords
Well how my new body, it shines
Somehow your blood makes you blind
To our divine, I am all yours

We will wear compassion
We will wear it
And the gates of Hell
Won't stand against it

We will wear compassion
We will wear it
And the gates of Hell
They won't stand, they won't stand against it.

We will wear compassion
We will wear it
And the gates of Hell (and the gates of Hell, they won't stand against it!)
They won't stand against it.

We will wear compassion
We will wear it (we will wear it)
And the gates of Hell (and the gates of Hell, they won't stand against it!)
They won't stand, they won't stand against it.
