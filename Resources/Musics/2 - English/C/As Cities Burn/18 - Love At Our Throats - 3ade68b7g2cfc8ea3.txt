LOVE AT OUR THROATS

right now is the time for the tired and forgotten
tired and forgotten
to turn in our legs, crippled from
our own way and strength
and let us strap compassion to our chests
and run as if we never knew how until now

we will wear compassion
we will wear it on our chests
and sing with love at our throats
like a child, it's all i know

Father, hide our hearts in you
lest we steal them back
and lay them at the feet of men
i know now that glory has not a place
near my hands or any man
