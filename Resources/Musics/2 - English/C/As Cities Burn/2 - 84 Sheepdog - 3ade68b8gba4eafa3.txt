84 SHEEPDOG

They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain, they fixed it...before you knew the difference.

And if the Good Lord's good sheep do their jobs,
you would never see they were wolves underneath.
But Good Lord have you ever seen so many teeth marks?
That's right, those containers of light come with a kiss.
But they got quite a bite.

They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain when you were young.
Fixed your brain, they fixed it...before you knew the difference.
(Ohhhhh)
They fixed your brain, they fixed it...before you knew the difference.

Come on!

We got our sidewalks.
We got all of our safely lit streets.
We got all of our light tested beliefs.
But when I find love so bright in the alleyway,
they throw her overboard, I watch her get lost in the wake.

They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain, they fixed it...before you knew the difference.
(WOAH!!)
They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain when you were young.
They fixed your brain, they fixed it...before you knew it.
OH!
