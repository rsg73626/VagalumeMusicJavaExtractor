WRONG BODY

If I make it to heaven
I may be as bloody as hell.
Would you still take me?
I'm afraid that you might say,
"Depart from me, I never knew you."

I'm in the wrong body.
I'm in the wrong body.
I'm in the wrong body.
I must have stumbled in.

All the love I want to give,
Gets caught between every rib. 
What does that make me?
I have good intentions,
But no exit for them to come out right through.

I'm in the wrong body.
I'm in the wrong body.
I'm in the wrong body.
I must have stumbled in.
