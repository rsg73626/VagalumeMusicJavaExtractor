HIGHER THAN I

father this is all I have
all is yours ever my last breath
from the ends of the earth, my heart cries
“lead me to the rock that is higher than I”
you sure don’t need me
but for some reason you want me
can I become what you’ve meant me to be?
father this is all I own
my soul finds rest in you alone
shelter in my storm you are my life
“lead me to the rock that is higher than I”
