THE HOARD

Good boys keep their livers clean
And smoke out of their lungs
Cause it's all about what you've done
Good boys don't make mistakes to learn from

Cause when heaven comes
They won't be caught being young

Grace make your way to the well
To those who deserve it
After all they've earned it
But vain, its in vain
Cause they don't need it

They're steady breathers
Who won't lift a finger for the gasping weaker
You just hoard your hollow completion
Like it's something wearing thin
Like it's gonna get you in
When heaven comes

Cause when heaven comes
I swear it comes in love

Grace make your way to the well
To those who deserve it
After all they've earned it
But vain, it's in vain
Cause they don't need it

Now i let go of your hand somewhere between
Love and what it demands of me

Grace make your way
