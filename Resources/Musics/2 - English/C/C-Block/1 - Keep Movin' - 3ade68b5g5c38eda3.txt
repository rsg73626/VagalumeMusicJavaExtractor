KEEP MOVIN'

Chorus: 
I gotta keep movin´, up and down this life 
I gotta keep movin´, leave the past behind 
And do all it should be done, to live my life and have some fun 
Life is how you make it, so take it 

Rap1: 
Now I see ya still movin, while I´m groovin, 
Once again I´m back in the house, I´m improovin, 
To let you know, let you real somethin good 
But not this, see you wish you could 
Gotta lay the past behind, what´s on my mind, 
It´s the rime shinin, clinin, I´m pporing on a way to the top 
With CBK-style with the club hiphop 
I bring it back, put it down the line 
I stop and come on the top of the dine 
Did you think I was gone all for real? 
But you´re going full, with the rap appeal, 
Now here it comes stronger much harder 
Where black and go, much started 
I can´t stop, nigga come Pop! Drop! 
Gotta keep movin´! 

Chorus x 2 

I gotta keep movin, up and down this life 

Rap2: 
I gotta keep movin´, while you snoozin 
It´s the club style mix, I´m here to proove it 
Now recognize the M to the M P, 
The P is for POP, and I don´t stop 
And I can´t be stopped now immitade it 
So watch out, yeah, ya still hacned 
It´s the digness with the mystery 
Now watch out and go, see I peep this 
I still standing on the eastcoast level 
I´m still diggin deep, and I´m remaining the shevel 
Now I keep going try to face that 
Still ponding powerful commercial track, jack 
Gotta bring it to you nice and slow 
On the carpet C, it is my time to glow 
I stay away to long, it´s beeting my chest like King Kong 

Chorus x 2 
I gotta keep, I gotta keep, I gotta keep on movin´ 
I gotta keep, I gotta keep, I gotta keep on movin´ 

Bridge: 
It´s 1999 ya´ll, and we still represent C-BLOCK 
We just tryin to let you know, Life is what you make it 
So leave the past behind, cause that´s the way it´s done, 
So keep movin! 

Chorus x 2 

I gotta keep movin, up and down this life
