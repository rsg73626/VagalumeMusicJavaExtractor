SO STRUNG OUT

Ok here it comes it start from the begin and it takes you two to yeking
For paranoia is all around you
like someone it 's watching u.
And it 's stil snowing through your blood vein.
Then you fall Down and pick yourself up;
and Say wich way am I going
So you take another step and another step
and it knocks all your feet again
And I'm Strung Out

{Chorus]
I'm so strung out And now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away Dear God or will you pull me through
I'm so strung out Some how my life has gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep
Please Lord now take my soul away

[Rap 1]
Now I'm all alone
Sittin' in my room in a corner
Starrin' at the wall and I'm wishing I was on a
Mission but I'm fishin' in an empty bowl
Cocain got my brain And I'm sweatin' 'cause I'm ice cold
Hold - on for a minute what's that sound
Raise up to my feet
Paranoid lookin' all around
Up down on the ground Is it reality?
Damn, I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
Now let me find another plan Lookin' for a plot
Lookin' for the man with the sack To get got
Shot Lay him down
'cause it don't be makin' me none
Cocain on my brain and I gotta get me some

[Chorus]
I'm so strung out And now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away Dear God or will you pull me through
I'm so strung out Some how my life has gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep
Please Lord now take my soul away

I'm so strung out And now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away Dear God or will you pull me through
I'm so strung out Some how my life has gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep
Please Lord now take my soul away

[Rap 2]
Another mystery
sittin' in another room At twelve noon
I hope something happen soon
I'm crawlin'
still burning my knee
at 45 degrees Saying please let it be
Something
In a form of a rock I can't stop
Because the spot getting hot tick tock
I see the devil clearer in my past It can't last
Because I'm running out of cash
A stash I remember
from December My mind gone blank And it could have been November
Now as I feel myself blink
I look at the world one time and then I think

[Chorus (2x)]



I'm so strung out, I don't know what to do
Should I take away my life, dear God
Or will you pull me through, will you pull me through
I'm so strung out, I'm so strung out

I know that you know that I'm living real trife
So lay down that pipe And pick back up your life
Just take it away, please God just take it away
Won't you just give another day to me

[Chorus (2x)]
