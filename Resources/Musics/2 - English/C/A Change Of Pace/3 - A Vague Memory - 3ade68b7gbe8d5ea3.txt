A VAGUE MEMORY

Tears from yesterday carry on through tomorrow
These words were to soft spoken and I don't want to regret anything
No letter could express this fear I feel inside
But I'll write it anyway

Your name will be the last from my lips (my lips)
Your face the last image in my eyes (my eyes)
Don't Let the wind blow and take this all away
Only in death will we rise

I'll leave final words and pray better days
My voice a vague memory washed away by your tears
It's hard to contemplate the obvious
But you're strong eough to make it through (To make it through)

A poetic tragedy falls upon your doorstep as you wake 
Confide in your friends and family to wash this pain away
Goodbyes are inevitable but I will see you again
And never forget the simple fact that I will always love you
Did I do you proud?

Your name will be the last from my lips (my lips)
Your face the last image in my eyes (my eyes)
Don't Let the wind blow and take this all away
Only in death will we rise

We'll we rise...
We'll we rise...
We'll we rise...
We'll we rise...
