SUMMER GIRLS

Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember when we met that summer?

New Kids on the Block had a Bunch of Hits
Chinese Food Makes Me Sick
And I think its fly when girls stop by for the summer (for the summer)
I Like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that Summer (since that summer)

Hip Hop momma layed spick & Span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that i ever did see
The Great Larry Bird Jersey 33
When you take a sip you Buzz like a Hornet
Billy Shakespeare Wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle Cause i cant speak baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy
Now I cant forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and Never Came Back
Stayed all Summer then went back Home
McCullay Culkin was in Home-Alone
Fell Deep In Love, but now we Aint Speakin'
Micheal J Fox Was Alex P. Keaton
When i met you i said my name Was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

Cherry Pez Coke Crush Rock Stud Boogie
Used to hate school, so i had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B Ball Style
Known to act wild and make a girl smile
Love new edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you cuz you rock my world
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
They drink Lemonade and speak real slow
You love Hip Hop and Rock and Roll
Dad took off when you were 4 years Old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I Feel much better baby when you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh when i tell a joke
When i met you i said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl from Abercrobie and Fitch

In The summertime girls got it goin on
Shake and wiggle to a Hip Hop Song
Summer time girls are the kind i like
I Steal your hunny like i stole your Bike
Boogaloo Shrimp and Pogo Sticks
My mind takes me back there oh so quick
Let you off the hook like my man Mr Limpit
Think about that summer and i bugged cuz i miss it
I like the Color Purple, Macaroni and Cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of Trees
I call you up but whats the use
I like Kevin Bacon but i hate Foot Loose
I Came in the Door I Said It Before
I Think Im Over you But im really not sure
When i met you i said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl From Abercrombie and Fitch

Summer girls come and Summer girls go
Some are worth While, and some are so so
Summer girls come and Summer girls go
Some are worth While, and some are so so
Summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind i like
Steal your honey like I stole your bike
