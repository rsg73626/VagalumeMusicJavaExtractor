WHITE LINES AND LIPSTICK

No dear could this be true? 
It's our lives we told 
The minds of such damaged boys 
Your dreams bought and sold 
Give me those bright blue eyes 
And those lucious lips 
I'll sing this song for you 
If you shake those hips 

And I know that, you wanted to 
Cause I see it, like I see through you 

I'm walking that white line 
And it's no big surprise that I can't sleep anymore 
It's just these little pills 
That make my dreams feel real and I'm still craving more 

And this show's come to an end 
And now the fun begins 
Just step into your skin 
And let things unfold 
Your body moves me girl 
And now you're whispering 
Everything I want to hear 
A puppet with no strings 

And I know that, you wanted to 
Cause I see it, like I see through you 

I'm walking that white line 
And it's no big surprise that I can't sleep anymore 
It's just these little pills 
That make my dreams feel real and I'm still craving more 

I'm walking that white line 
And it's no big surprise that I can't sleep anymore 
It's just these little pills 
That make my dreams feel real and I'm still craving more (I'm still craving more)
