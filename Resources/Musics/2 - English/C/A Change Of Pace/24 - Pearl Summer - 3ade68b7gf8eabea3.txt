PEARL SUMMER

You're my Sun, my Moon, my Skies,
your my everything...
You're my Sun, my Moon, my Skies,
Your my everything
And everyday being with you, makes me
Think, what a new day will bring
You're my life and my breath
You're exactly what I need right now
And I'll never take you for granted
No not for a moment
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
We should be together for eternity
Don't let go to let me know THAT this is over
And maybe I held on to long but now, I see
The life I left was not the best, and I no longer believe
You're not the one I knew but i'll stay true to my heart and myself
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
We should be together for eternity
I know I'll find myself
I know I'll find myself
I know I'll find myself
I know I'll find myself
