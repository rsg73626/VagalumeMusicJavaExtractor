SHOOT FROM THE HIP

Picture perfect turned to worthless 
bittersweet the taste is like ash in my mouth 
love we had it you're a bad habit 
I'm ready to give you up i give up 

silly me for thinking honesty is something given free 
i make the rules and this is how it ends 

heartbreak baby is half the fun 
you bring the bullets i'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
i shoot from the hip then watch you fall 

heartbreak baby is half the fun 
you bring the bullets i'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
i shoot from the hip then watch you fall 

scenes of passion never lasted 
your mistakes are too much to put behind 
i am tired with no desire 
to put together things that just fall apart 

silly me for thinking honesty is something given free 
i make the rules and this is how it ends 

heartbreak baby is half the fun 
you bring the bullets i'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
i shoot from the hip then watch you fall 

heartbreak baby is half the fun 
you bring the bullets i'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
i shoot from the hip then watch you fall 
then watch you fall 

silly me for thinking honesty is something given free 
i make the rules and this is how it ends 

heartbreak baby is half the fun 
you bring the bullets i'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
i shoot from the hip then watch you fall 

heartbreak baby is half the fun 
you bring the bullets i'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
i shoot from the hip then watch you fall
