HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS

Say something anything right now
You know i’m choking on
How bad it hurts
To say goodbye
Just in the words i say to you
Its killing me to see you desperate
Believe in what you want

Just tell me how long it takes
Until i’m in the right place

Here we go again
I’m happy i went
All this life behind
But its all over now
Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to find her way somehow
Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to leave it

Say something anything right now
I know you’re choking
On how bad it hurts
To let us go
Cry yourself asleep again tonight
Writing notes in with
You’re love from everyone
Everyone

Just tell me how long it takes
Until i’m in the right place

Here we go again
I’m happy i went
All this life behind
But its all over now
Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to find her way somehow
Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to leave it all behind

You build me up and break me down
Ill find a way to leave this town
And nothing good you’ll ever say
Will stay with me
Please stay with me
[x2]

Stay with me

Here we go again
I’m happy i went
All this life behind
But its all over now
Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to find her way somehow
Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to leave it all behind
All behind
