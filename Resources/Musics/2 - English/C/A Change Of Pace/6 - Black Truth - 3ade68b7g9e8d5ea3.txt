BLACK TRUTH

No safe from the silence still haunting me
Away from this place where i’ve been to long
A majestic sunset lays in wait for that beautiful day
That was never meant to be

When time and space collide in this head on crash
Who will be the first to break these silences with lies
If truth is pain then let me be your masochist
And bury the rest in this burning flame that is my life

This fate has dealt me nothing but broken glass
A single note that always rings off key
Just like the lines used in an overplayed tragedy
This time we’ve gone to far

You were so much better than this
This time we’ve gone to far
Leave all your lies
Leave all your tears

Remember change is the only constant...

Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies
Black truth, white lies

You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
