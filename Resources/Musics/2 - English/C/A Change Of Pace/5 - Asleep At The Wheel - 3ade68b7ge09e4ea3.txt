ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL

Asleep at the wheel a red light mistake 
take my word for what its worth 
life at a stand still not one second passes 
and in the asphault I see a best friend 
(crashing through the window) 

dont move 
save me 
cry out 
to god above 

And would you save everyone if you 
saw them dying 
watch as they slip through your hands 
bring me back to life bring them back to life 
one step further form all of this 

abstract emotions in dealing with death 
the warmth of my breath turns to ice 
beating the concrete your hands 
cut and bruised and in the end 
not a question of why 
(crashing through the window) 

dont move 
save me 
cry out 
to god above 

And would you save everyone 
if you saw them dying 
watch as they slip through your hands 
bring them back to life bring them back to life 
one step further from all of this 

never forget what im bleeding 
gasp for air now i am apart of this 
leave me suffering never break 
your promises 
never forget and you'll 
never forget what i've done 

and would you save everyone 
if ytou saw them dying 
watch as they slip through your hands 
bring me back to life bring them back to life 
one step further from all of this 

dont move 
save me 
cry out 
to god above
