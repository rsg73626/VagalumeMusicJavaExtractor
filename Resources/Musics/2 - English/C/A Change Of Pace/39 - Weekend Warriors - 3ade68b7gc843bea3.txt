WEEKEND WARRIORS

Weekends are for the warriors 
Uhh, those late nights 
Walking through front doors at daybreak 
Raise all, uhh, crashing hell 
And this was all of us sitting around here 
On Friday night 

And I could't ask for 
A better place to be 

We find a place 
To just stay free 
We never say 'Never' 
We're leave this and stuck to me 
I'll stay around forever 

Well, we're bringing hell back 
Ohh, the slow stores 
Yeaa, the bathroom stalls 
Which you pulled me out of 
I'll be there 
Like you've been there 
My words rebound 
You can always hold on me 

And I could't ask for 
A better place to be 

We find a place 
To just stay free 
We never say 'Never' 
We're leave this so stuck to me 
I'll stay around forever 

We find a place 
To just stay free 
We never say 'Never' 
We're leave this so stuck to me 
I'll stay around forever 

This can't last forever 
Razor, glass together 
Doesn't get much better 
No better than... 

This can't last forever 
Razor, glass together 
Doesn't get much better 
No better than... 

This can't last forever 
Razor, glass together 
Doesn't get much better 
No better than... 

This can't last forever 
Razor, glass together 
Doesn't get much better 
No better than this 

We find a place 
To just stay free 
We never say 'Never' 
We're leave this so stuck to me 
I'll stay around forever 

We find a place 
To just stay free 
We never say 'Never' 
We're leave this so stuck to me 
I'll stay around forever 

The weekends are for the warriors
