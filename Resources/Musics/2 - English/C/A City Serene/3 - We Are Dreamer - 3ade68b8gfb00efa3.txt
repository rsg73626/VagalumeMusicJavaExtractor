WE ARE DREAMER

This is your warning!

Now look at what you've left behind.
Something for nothing never crossing your mind.
Looks like you've crossed the line.
You're regrets; they're hiding in your eyes.
I've heard that one to many times.
Now your excuses only pass me by.
And I swear that when nobody knows your alive you'll be thinking of me.

The fear of waking up to find the storm has just begun
Leaves a feeling so haunting and daunting in every single one of us to share.

I see you burning, but oh, I wanna feel you burn.
You've blinded diamond eyes with false gold.
My hands are tied riding on a will to survive.

Now look at what you've left behind.
Something for nothing never crossing your mind.
Looks like you've crossed the line.
You're regrets; they're hiding in your eyes.
I've heard that one to many times.
Now your excuses only pass me by.
And I swear that when nobody knows your alive you'll be thinking of me.

You're in my eyes while in my heart you'll rest in pieces.
I need to see if you can look me in the eyes.
Are you drowning?
Am I what caused all of these lies?

Why aren't you drowning?"
Why aren't you dead?

Now look at what you've left behind.
Something for nothing never crossing your mind.
Looks like you've crossed the line.
You're regrets; they're hiding in your eyes.
I've heard that one to many times.
Now your excuses only pass me by.
And I swear that when nobody knows your alive you'll be thinking of me.

I'll never hold my tongue.
