HELLO, NIGHTMARE

I am your nightmare. Fall asleep.
Lifeless on the floor, you plead for salvation.
I am your savior.
You cannot tear me from your dreams.
I'm the terrors in your sleep

I'd kill to see you drowning in an ocean full of sensless promises.
Don't you ever hold your tongue again.
Sleeping with a sense of dire need to dream, I can never believe the things we've seen.
This is such a nightmare

Simple lies, you've mastered your disguise.
And now im reaching for the truth.
Im reaching for whats left of you.
Breathe and exhale everything you've ever lost.
You've lost all sense of anything we both have ever known to be.

A melody fills the precious hearts of gold
And leaves the traitors in the hands of the weak.

Master, may I speak?
I seek safty in my dreams.
In my heart I know you're breathless.
You've got a deathwish screaming:
Come and get me
You wont find me
Try and kill me
You fucking burned me.

Simple lies, you've mastered your disguise.
And now im reaching for the truth.
Im reaching for whats left of you.
Breathe and exhale everything you've ever lost.
You've lost all sense of anything we both have ever known to be.

I am your nightmare
