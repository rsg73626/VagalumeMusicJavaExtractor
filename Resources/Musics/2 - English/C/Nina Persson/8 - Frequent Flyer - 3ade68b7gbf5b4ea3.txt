FREQUENT FLYER

Would you help me pack my bags
I might be leaving
I need some sweet assistance
While I'm stealing
Some of your time
I hope that's fine

And I've got photographs
Of all you all I'm needing
Forgiveness if I
Left you all believing

That I'm the one
Cause I feel like none
And I need something
To direct me to it

Cause I'm a frequent flyer
A notorious liar, ohh
But I can't get close enough
I never get close
I can't get close enough

I would love to tell my story
From the ending
But the story's getting thin
From heavy spending

And I need my man
And I need a fence
And I need someone to protect me
From the wench

I'm a frequent flyer
A notorious liar, ohh
But I can't get close enough
I never get close
I can't get close enough
To the ending

I can't get close enough, I, I, I
I can't get close enough
To the sun
I can't get close enough

I'm a frequent flyer
A notorious liar, ohh
But I can't get close enough
I never get close
I can't get close enough
It seems
