ODDNESS OF THE LORD

Come on baby sing 
Of the oddness of the lord 
It's about time we sang 
Of the strange ways of the lord 

The oddness of the lord 
The oddness of the lord 

Come on baby sing 
Of the oddness of the lord 
The strange ways of the lord 
The sacred and the curst 

It's never getting better, no no no 
It's only getting worse 

Come on people sing 
Of the oddness of the lord 
Eveybody sing 
Of the strange ways of the lord 

The oddness of the lord, ah ah ah 
The sacred and the curst 

It's never getting better, no no no 
It's only getting worse 

It's never getting better, no no no 
No no
