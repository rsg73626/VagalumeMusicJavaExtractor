DESAFINADO

Love is like a never-ending melody
Poets have compared it to a symphony
A symphony conducted, by the lighting of the moon
But our song of love is slightly out of tune
Once your kiss has raised me to a fever pitch
And now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich
It seems to me you changed the tune we sing

Like a bossa nova love should swing
We used to harmonise, two souls in perfect time
But now the song is different
And the words don't even rhyme
'cause you forgot the melody our hearts would always groove
And what good is a heart that is slightly out of tune?

Tune your heat to mine, the way it used to be
Join with me in harmony
And sing a song of loving
We're bound to get in tune again
Before too long
There'll be no desafinado
When your heart belongs to me completely
Then you won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing along with me

Like a bossa nova love should swing
We used to harmonise, two souls in perfect time
But now the song is different
And the words don't even rhyme
'cause you forgot the melody our hearts would always groove
And what good is a heart that is slightly out of tune?

Tune your heat to mine, the way it used to be
Join with me in harmony
And sing a song of loving
We're bound to get in tune again
Before too long
There'll be no desafinado
When your heart belongs to me completely
Then you won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing along with me
