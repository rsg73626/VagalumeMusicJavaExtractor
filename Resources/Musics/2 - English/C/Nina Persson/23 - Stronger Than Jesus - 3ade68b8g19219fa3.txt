STRONGER THAN JESUS

Who told you love is the Alpha and Omega?
And that your heart will lead you to the only one?
It's a curse, it’s the hammer that will break ya
It's a poison hidden in a bonbon

Don't you know love stronger than Jesus?
Don't you know love can kill anyone?
Bring it on, wars and diseases
You know that love can do you like a shot gun

Can't resist them the sailors and the soldiers
Taking aim, a rabbit on a rifle range
Pay no mind to what your mamma told ya
You're the fool who's chasing down the candy canes

It's a riddle how lovers can stay alive.
That we bloom and breathe and multiply

Don't you know love stronger than Jesus?
Don't you know love can kill anyone?
So bring it on, wars and diseases
You know that love can do you like a shot gun

No, oh no
Oh, oh no

See the people heading for disaster
Standing in line just looking for a little fun

Love is a fire a hot, hot blaster
And we're the Belgians burning in the Congo sun
We're believers, trust in strangers
Any monkey looking like a savior

It's a riddle how
We’re still living now
Oh how little we know

Don't you know love stronger than Jesus?
Don't you know love can kill anyone?
Bring it on, wars and diseases
You know that love can do you like a shot gun

Don't you know love stronger than Jesus?
Don't you know love can kill anyone?
Bring it on, wars and diseases
You know that love can do you like a shot gun
Oh, oh no
Oh, oh no
