HERE ARE MANY WILD ANIMALS

Ooh ee ooh
Ooh ee ooh ahh

The road of our journey is traced out in pink
A map of the continents waiting to sink
We’re an army in training me and my band
Making camp in the evenings grazing the land
We are never alone here
There’s a lot of unknown here in the brush
Here are many wild animals

We’ve followed the highways through a forest of sparks
They grouped us in twos when we boarded the ark
Shipped off to cities tripped off our tongues
Now we live in a playground eating our young, oh
We are never alone here, no
There’s lot of unknown here in the crowd
Here are many wild animals

Ooh... they’re dropping the bomb
Ooh... they’re dropping the bomb

Like in the beginning the number is three
It’s a small party of roaches, scorpions and me
Forever alone here
There’s lot of unknown here in the glow
Here are many wild animals

Ooh ee ooh
Ooh ee ooh...
Come little kitty
Come little elephant
Come, come hither
Be with your mamma
Come little pastor
Come little millionaire
Come, come faster
This is america
Come little rodent
Come little carnivour
Eat your dinner
