THE SAME OLD SONG

Here's my prayer 
I'm getting nowhere 
I'm stepping up the stairs 
But falling behind, ooh 
I'm a one man show 
That nobody knows 
My body's thorn out 
I'm wondering why 

I can't go on singing this song 
But the angels will not hear 
The world is so old 
From all that i stole 
There is still a little love in here 
... will last 
I did it too fast 
But i'm learning to cry 
Don't be a stepping stone 
Get it all out 
Deliver it 

Here's my weap 
I'm digging too deep 
I do believe in lies 
As i got eveything to hide, ooh 
I'm a young ... 
I do what i'm told 
Cut open unfold 
But there's nothing insde 

I can't go on singing this song 
But the angels will not hear 
The world is a home 
From all that i stole 
But there is still a little love in here 
You think it will last 
I did it too fast 
I'm learning to cry 
Reach out 
... too low 
Deliver it 

I can't go on singing this song 
But the angels will not hear 
The world is a home 
From all that i stole 
But there is so much love in here 
You think it will last 
I did it too fast 
But i'm learning to cry 
Don't be a stepping stone 
Get it all out 
Deliver it 

Here's my plead 
My never-ending repeat 
I'm a circle of cry baby 
With no one to try 
I'm a restless mad 
... 
If somebody wants to kill me 
Go ahead 
But make it fast
