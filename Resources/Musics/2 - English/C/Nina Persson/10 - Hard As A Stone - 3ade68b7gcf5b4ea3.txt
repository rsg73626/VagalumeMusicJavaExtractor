HARD AS A STONE

In the morning and in the evening
When you think you’re alone
Too many hours in your apartment
Has made me hard a stone

I tried to crack you
I told you you’re the one
But you must have though that i was gone
I told you a lot of lies just to get laid
But your heart is hard as a stone

You’re a vicious but i’m a man
I’m gonna do what i can to remain hard as a stone

That little pigeon where did you find it?
I had to break her every bone
Eleven hours in your pool
No wonder i’m hard as a stone

She was delicious now i’m a star
If you wanna be what you are you better be hard as a stone

(the chorus)

You’re mean, but i’m a man
It’s not exactly what i planned but it seems i’m hard as astone
Hard as a stone
