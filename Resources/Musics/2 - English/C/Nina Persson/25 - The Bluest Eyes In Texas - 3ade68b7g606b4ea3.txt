THE BLUEST EYES IN TEXAS

The lonesome texas sun was setting low
and in the rearview mirror i watch it go
i can still see the wind and the golden hair
i close my eyes for a moment, i'm still there

the bluest eyes in texas
are haunting me tonight
like the stars that filled the midnight sky
her memory fills my mind
(where did i go wrong)
did i wait too long
but can i make it right
the bluest eyes in texas
are haunting me tonight

another town another hotel room
another dream that ended way too soon
left me lonley waiting before the dawn
searching for the strenght to carry on

the bluest eyes in texas
are haunting me tonight
like the stars that filled the midnight sky
her memory fills my mind
(where did i go wrong)
did i wait too long
but can i make it right
the bluest eyes in texas
are hauntin me tonight

for every heart you break you pay the price
but i can't forget the tears in her blue eyes

the bluest eyes in texas
are haunting me tonight
like the stars that filled the midnight sky
her memory fills my mind
(where did i go wrong)
did i wait too long
but can i make it right
the bluest eyes in texas
are haunting me tonight

the bluest eyes in texas
are haunting me tonight
the bluest eyes
the bluest eyes
are haunting me
the bluest eyes
tonight
