TRAIN OF SALVATION

I walked on every road now
I followed the signs
I’m traveling on my own now
With no peace of mind
I’m at the battle station
And i’m out of my truck
My final departure is near
I’m leaving endless black tunnels
For a wide-open field
I’m blank and i’m out of beer

I’m waiting for a train of salvation
Steaming with a glow into my head
To know my very needs and my station
And to dry up every tear I’ve ever shed

My charcoal is desire
Eternal release
I know there is a fire
An engine of peace
To change my desperate moment
To a time-table role
And take me to the end of the line
I bought a no-return ticket
From a station I’m saint
I’m broke but my ride’s divine

I’m waiting for a train of salvation
Steaming with a glow into my head
To know my very needs and my station
And to dry up every tear i’ve ever shed

I’m at the battle station
Being reason or rhyme
But it seems like I’m finally on time
Because the platform is shaking
The concrete is cracking
I’m leaving it all behind

I’m ready for a train of salvation
Steaming with a glow into my head
To know my very needs and my station
And to dry up every tear i’ve ever shed
