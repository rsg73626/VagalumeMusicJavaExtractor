LOVE HAS LEFT THE ROOM

Love has left the room
The party is over but I can’t get sober
Obsession is towing me deep down down

Love has left the room
It fled out the back door
When all that I ask for
Was forever more or a real bye bye
It didn’t say bye bye

And I let go if you just tell me
Give back the pieces of dreams that you sell me
They trick my mind
I let go if you just let me
I will forget you if you will forget me
I slip your mind, I will slip your mind

Tie me to the mast
Cast me in irons so I hear the sirens
They sing of desire, the fatal kind
This love is my last
My final possesion, most violent caress
It’s a beautiful mess and it’s deep down down
It’s really deep down down

And I let go if you just tell me
Give back the pieces of dreams that you sell me
They trick my mind
I let go if you just let me
I will forget you if you will forget me
I slip your mind, I will slip your mind

Once it’s settles down
And the fire has burned out
What do you think you’ll find
Poking through the embers
Memories that sting
Little splinters of your doubt
Things that you can’t live without
So I die
Give back the pieces of dreams that you sell me
And trick my mind
I let go if you just let me
I will forget you if you will forget me
I slip your mind
I will slip your mind
I will slip your mind
I will slip your mind
I will slip your mind
I will slip your mind
