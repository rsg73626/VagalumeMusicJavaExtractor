ROCK 'N' ROLL GHOST

Well, you know 
And you go 
When I'm alone I have no cause 
To think about the sheet 
We used to know 
You made a snow 

Well, you came 
And you stayed 
No one here to raise a toast 
Be my guest 
And i will be your host 
To a rock n roll ghost 
A rock n roll ghost 

Well, you said: 
"She's better off dead" 
You think that I'm a... lot of words 
But i was much to young 
And much too cool for words 
Look at me not 

No one here to raise a toast 
Take me by the hand 
And raise a toast 
Oh, the rock n roll ghost 
To a rock n roll ghost 

We don't know untill we come 

There's no one here to raise a toast 
I look into the mirror and I see 
The rock'n roll ghost 
My rock'n roll ghost
