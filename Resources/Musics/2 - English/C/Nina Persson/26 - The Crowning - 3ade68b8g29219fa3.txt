THE CROWNING

Brighten the corners and clear out the room
Color the flowers in rose and maroon
Light up the fires and season the swine
We're gonna party like its 1699

Slaughter the rabbits, the doves and the boars
And lay all the tables and open the doors
The creme de la creme will be waiting on one guest of honour

Up go the curtains and down go the virgins
Oh no mothers are cryin'
Ladies of virtue will stand to accuse you of heartbreak and theft

Bells are gonna ring birds are gonna sing let the people begin
The crowning of your big head

Young drunken girls in a hideous dance
Sing a heartfelt lament of the death of romance
Beautiful boys turn and offer their cheeks
Preening and prancing the outcome looks bleak

Good times are rolling but outside these walls
Our houses will crumble, the city will fall
But a few broken pawns dont mean nothing to our guest of honour

So lets raise our glasses to murderous asses like you
May you sleep soundly
Once we have laughter, you got what you're after
Oh you wear it well!

Bells are gonna ring, birds are gonna sing
Let the people begin
Hear how their hearts are pounding
Were all witnessing the crowning
Of your big bleeding head

Bells are gonna ring, birds are gonna sing
Let the people begin
Hear how their hearts are pounding
Your rise nothing but astounding
Were all witnessing the crowning of your useless, rooftless head
