ONE MORE RAZOR

Differences are holding me down,
I wish I could say I really do not care,
100 years into the past, 
I wish I could say I really wasn't there

Hold this razor in my eyes, 
Do me a favour,
Cut them out now,
Cut them out now,
It would be so easy if I could not see

A secret affair I look into your stare,
I look into your soul and I see there's nothing there,
I try not to laugh, but this is not real,
You don't have much time, The pain is real

Hold this razor in my eyes, 
Do me a favour,
Cut them out now,
Cut them out now,
It would be so easy if I could not see
