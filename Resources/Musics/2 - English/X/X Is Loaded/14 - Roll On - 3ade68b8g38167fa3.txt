ROLL ON

Lay me down confusion twisted out of place,
I am a tourist here, I can't get home,
Beneath the rocks that hide me I will make a claim,
If I wait for life, I wait in vain

Roll on if you know where you come from,
Hold on If you can raise a smile,
Hold on in time you know you can make it,
Hey you

Doubt is a killing ground, 
Grown into fatal hands,
Hold on to what you know - Ride it home,
And the whispering it left you cold,
Castles fall into the sand, it makes no sense

And you get where you're going,
Get where you're going,
Get where you're going,

Roll on if you know where you come from,
Hold on If you can raise a smile,
Hold on in time you know you can make it,
Hey you

Hold on to the city,
It takes alot to break me,
Hold onto the city,
It takes alot to break me

Roll on if you know where you come from,
Hold on If you can raise a smile,
Hold on in time you know you can make it
