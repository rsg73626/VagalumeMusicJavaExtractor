RACKETEER

Burnt out of reason, I feel like I want to give in,
Sometimes I feel like area fifty one

I bleed for, breed for the racketeer,
Wasted, Inebriated racketeer,
One drink's not enough drink to kill the fear,
Give for the racketeer

Cheekbones and new clothes, money and neurofen,
So high and so dry, don't talk just chew off your tongue

I bleed for, breed for the racketeer,
Wasted, Inebriated racketeer,
One drink's not enough drink to kill the fear,
Give for the racketeer

Welcome to the game, my friend...

There comes a knock on the door but there is no relief,
Bootlegged and wasted, cut from a different leaf

I bleed for, breed for the racketeer,
Wasted, Inebriated racketeer,
One drink's not enough drink to kill the fear,
Give for the racketeer
