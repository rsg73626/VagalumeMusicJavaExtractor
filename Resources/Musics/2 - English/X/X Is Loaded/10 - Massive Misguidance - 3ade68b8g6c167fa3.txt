MASSIVE MISGUIDANCE

Feeling's make you weak
But that's Ok, 'cause you're free now,
Never need to cry,
Cry, cry, cry,
Freedom comes in our free world

I die alone today,
I saw burning sleighs,
Here comes massive misguidance,
You are the missed resiliance

Contemplent on rio
Instead of punch, on our last day,
Meaning's never clear,
You give me my gravestone

I die alone today.
I saw burning sleighs,
(I see you, I'm coming to get you!)
Here comes massive misguidance,
You are the missed resilience
(go, go, go)

Here comes massive misguidance
You are the missed resilience
