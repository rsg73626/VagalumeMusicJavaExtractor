BLEEDING THE SHAPES

Take down the blinds, let in all the light,
What you need you don't talk about,
Small sounds drowned out,
Strength comes way down

I'm bleeding the shapes so you remember,
What will it take? 
before you remember, remember me,
I don't know where it ends

A lack in trust, played out masquerade,
What I see, is it man made?
Small sounds drowned out,
Strength comes way down

I'm bleeding the shapes so you remember,
What will it take? 
before you remember, remember me

What will it take? 
before you remember, remember me

And I don't know how it ends
