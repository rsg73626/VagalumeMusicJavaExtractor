DEAN PARK

you, someday son raised to fill the breach,
Tired, uninspired, 
There was nothing you could do to fake it

Waste Waste in you,
Are you gonna listen to what everybody tells you,
'cos you don't have a clue about what anybody means,
Out in the wild Dean Park, Dean Park, Dean Park don't go

Out in the wild Brace, 
Left no trace Of what you really held inside
Dreams, nightmare scenes,
All the other freaks are leaving,
Waste, I hate the taste,
Another sum sent to break you

Waste Waste in you,
Are you gonna listen to what everybody tells you,
'cos you don't have a clue about what anybody means,
Out in the wild Dean Park, Dean Park, Dean Park don't go
