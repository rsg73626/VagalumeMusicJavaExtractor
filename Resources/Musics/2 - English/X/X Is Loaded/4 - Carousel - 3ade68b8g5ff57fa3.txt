CAROUSEL

Strung out on a rope,
We're dead out of line
Everybody out here is looking for a paradise
Everybody's got something they wanna take from me
It's the first day with the team,
We'll just pinch all your sanity

Welcome to the carousel
sick and tired of being well
Everybody wants to go round again

Ride up this carousel love
Electric blue, let's spin together
Ride up this carousel love
Electric blue, let's spin together
Let's spin forever

If she left me, I'd be free
I get to look back royally
Welcome to the carousel, stick your time
Let's go round again
I see your bully come for me
I see the floor covered with blood

Welcome to the carousel
sick and tired of being well
Everybody wants to go round again

Ride up this carousel love
Electric blue, let's spin together
Ride up this carousel love
Electric blue, let's spin together
Let's spin forever

Ride up this carousel love
Electric blue, let's spin together
Ride up this carousel love
Electric blue, let's spin together
Let's spin forever
