THE START OF EVERYTHING

The start of everything,
Is easier than the end,
Famous to a room,
Empty, but they're dust,
Oh Yeah

There she stands,
At the end of the line,
Waiting to be seen,
And I still dont know,
All the best things she said,
Waiting for the end,

Join the line if you want it,
Are you scared of a fight?
Don't forget that I'm waiting,
Don't forget to come home

The start of everything,
Is easier than the end,
Famous to a room,
Empty but they're dust,
Oh yeah

There she stands,
In the arms of another,
Waiting to be seen,
The whispered love,
She's so sweetly forgotten,
Will never leave her side

Join the line if you want it,
Are you scared of a fight?
Don't forget that I'm waiting,
Don't forget to come home

Wait for the end,
Will you wait?
Will you wait for me?
Fight to the end
Will you fight?
Will you fight for me?
