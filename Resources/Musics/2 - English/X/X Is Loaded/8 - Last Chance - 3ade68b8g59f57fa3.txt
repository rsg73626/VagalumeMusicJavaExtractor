LAST CHANCE

Something inside is strange, Lost and Confused again 
I Couldn't find my way, lost to this century,
Where has the patience gone? Lost to this nameless song,
I need the space you fill and loneliness you kill.

As the night comes down, blonde ambitions rule
But there's something wrong,
And I know it's you, I want
And it's you, I need
This is my last chance, I should have died,
I would have died for you

I saw ambition die, swallowed by gravity,
I beat a random heart, your hole is hard to please

As the night comes down, blonde ambitions rule
But there's something wrong,
And I know it's you, I want
And it's you, I need
This is my last chance, I should have died,
I would have died for you

But there's something wrong,
And I know it's you I need,
This is my last chance, I should have died,
I would have died for you
