BREAK IT ON THE WAY DOWN

You're my broken shield from a broken path,
I dont know know how I got this feeling,
I could fucking laugh,

Take away from what we left coz I dont wanna fall,
Gonna break it on the way down,
I'm gonna break it on the way down,

You're my broken life line from a sinking ship,
No one comes to rescue me, no one gives a shit,

Take away from what we left coz I dont wanna fall,
Gonna break it on the way down,
I'm gonna break it on the way down,

You're alone don't walk away,
Like dominos
You're alone don't walk away,

I was a wreckless suffered when it all went wrong,
To the beating from my feelings
Now I'm not that strong,

Take away from what we left coz I dont wanna fall,
Gonna break it on the way down,
I'm gonna break it on the way down,

You're alone don't walk away,
Like dominos
You're alone don't walk away,

Take away from what we left coz I dont wanna fall,
Gonna break it on the way down,
I'm gonna break it on the way down,

Getting off at the front of the train, go
