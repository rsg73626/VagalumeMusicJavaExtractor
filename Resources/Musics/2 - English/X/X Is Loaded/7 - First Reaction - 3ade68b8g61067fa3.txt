FIRST REACTION

Left Out, 
Breathing something new,
Everybody has a price,
It gets me down, it gets me down.
Twisting from the start,
Night seems to depart

He's lost inside a suicide,
Lost inside a suicide.

Distance, Return,
First Reaction: Lost in your eyes.
Distance, Return,
First Reaction: Lost in your eyes.

Last Out, 
Loved-Shaped Lie Machines,
A love pushed deep into your dreams,
It gets me down, it gets me down
Whispers from the past,
Let down from the start
Your eyes hide no lies,
Your eyes are ocean-sized.

Distance, Return
First Reaction: Lost in your eyes
Distance, Return
First Reaction: Lost in your eyes

Distance, Return
First Reaction: Lost in your eyes
Distance, Return
First Reaction: Lost in your eyes
