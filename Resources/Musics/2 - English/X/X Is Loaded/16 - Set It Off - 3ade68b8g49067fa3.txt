SET IT OFF

She's still wasted
As she crawls into the bed
"I won't remember your name,
So tonight conseal my pain"

c'mon, c'mon
She said she's seen it all before
C'mon, C'mon,
She said, She said

Turn you on, to feel it
Set it Off, C'mon I know you can
Take it off now, I know you can,
Turn you on, to feel it,

When I wake up,
She said she's miss Duclar
She told me she was a teacher
No more, I remember her words


c'mon, c'mon
She said she's seen it all before
C'mon, C'mon,
She said, She said

Turn you on, to feel it
Set it Off, C'mon I know you can
Take it off now, I know you can,
Turn you on, to feel it,

C'mon... C'mon...
I've seen it all before...
Been feeling much to long

Turn you on, to feel it
Set it Off, C'mon I know you can
Take it off now, I know you can,
Turn you on, to feel it,
