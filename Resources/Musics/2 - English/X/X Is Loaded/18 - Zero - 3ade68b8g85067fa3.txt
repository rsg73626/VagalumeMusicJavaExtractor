ZERO

Zero,
Is in your mind
changing without reason,
Wide eyed,
In a smokey room,
Falling with precision

It's not my world,
It's all I got now

Facing,
This new world war,
A reason with a conscience,
Thinking,
Maybe it's Ok to leave it,
Where I found it

It's not my world
It's all I got now

We'll break you down,
We'll break you down,
We'll break you,
Got a feeling I'm not your leader

Faster,
In this new found world,
A feeling is nothing,
Wanting,
In this dead-end world,
It's breaking the smaller mind

It's not my world,
It's all I got now,

We'll break you down,
We'll break you down,
We'll break you,
Got a feeling I'm not your fucking leader

It's not my world, I miss you,
It's not my world, I miss you,
It's not my world, I miss you,
It's not my world, I miss you,
It's not my world,
It's all I got now.
