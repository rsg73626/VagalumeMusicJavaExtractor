13 DAYS

Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up
Walk alone for 13 days

awnser the questions 
we all need inventions
as we walk in the dark

I never lose control
It's just a state of mind
Never lose control...

I saw you working
Spilling your blood
Taking the money
Treading the mud

Hold me...

Hold me, thrill me, kiss me
Will you miss me?
as we step out of time

I never lose control
It's just a state of mind
Never lose control...

My bones hold a secret 
no one can tell
How much is real and how I should feel
I will not reveal

I never lose control
It's just a state of mind
Never lose control...
