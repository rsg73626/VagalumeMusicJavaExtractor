RAW NERVE

She's waiting waiting...

I'm on a steep slope, Im in need of hope,
I need feelings to get through you

She is always dancing on a raw nerve,
She is always biting through a raw nerve,
She is always dancing on a raw nerve,
She is always biting through a raw nerve

She's waiting waiting...

I take ten tons into her magnet sun,
These forces burn through me

She is always dancing on a raw nerve,
She is always biting through a raw nerve,
She is always dancing on a raw nerve,
She is always biting through a raw nerve,
