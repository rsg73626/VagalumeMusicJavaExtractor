FALLOUT

Get back, don't come closer,
Morning has come too soon,
Light up the brightest candle,
Darkness begins to creep

Contagious Nuclear fallout,
Contagious nuclear fallout

Mantis, divine a future,
Prophet in all our fears,
Anxious to get airborne,
I want you to wake me,
The message is deadly,
We can't stop the fallout

Contagious Nuclear fallout,
Contagious Nuclear fallout,
Contagious Nuclear fallout,
Contagious Nuclear fallout

Hey, what's out there?
Hey, what's out there?

Contagious Nuclear fallout,
Contagious Nuclear fallout
