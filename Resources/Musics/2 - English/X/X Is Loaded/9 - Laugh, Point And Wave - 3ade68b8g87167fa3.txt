LAUGH, POINT AND WAVE

Those Demands that ask too much
Are broken down with enough human touch

A test will come and a test will kill
if you feel alone at the bottom of the hill

laugh point and wave
they laugh point and wave
laugh point and wave
they laugh point and wave

Shrink from you
I hate the way I do
when I need you the most
Cold, cold heart
stacked indecision
I survive this condition
with enough human touch

laugh point and wave
they laugh point and wave
laugh point and wave
they laugh point and

Watch Out!
