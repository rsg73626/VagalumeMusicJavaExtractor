STRANGER IN PARADISE

Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh...
Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh...

Once on a dream not so long ago
I met my lover who I wanted to know
He took my hand and said: follow me
He took me the head to I rest on him
He showed me castles in the sky
On those fields a flower really caught my eyes
He torn the shadows of the night to light
Cause when he touched me
woh woh woh woh

Talk to me-e
Just say you want me-e
To want you
I would follow you
If you just need me-e
Don't leave me
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise

Talk to me-e
Just say you want me-e
To want you
I would follow you
If you just need me-e
Don't leave me
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise

Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh
Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh

His whispered words make my heart thin
My secret lover heals me everything
with simple smile he touched my heart-strings
a dream come true is my wed ring
While building castles in the sky
a bouquet of flowers as we walked on by
we touched the sun that torn lightness bright
When he touched me woh woh woh woh

Talk to me-e
Just say you want me-e
To want you
I would follow you
If you just need me-e
Don't leave me
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise

Talk to me-e
Just say you want me-e
To want you
I would follow you
If you just need me-e
Don't leave me
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise

In paradise, in paradise
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise
Cause I'm just a stranger in paradise

Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh
Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh... Eh eh

Once on
