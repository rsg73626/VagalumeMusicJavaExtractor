NOTHING TO LOOSE

Darkness comes inside
The coldness of night
Fulfills my world
Closely fog arises
From soil
Dazzles my view
Shadows cover my soul
Isolation controlls
The game called life
Muted screams resounds
In the nonexistence
Noone could hear
Get me
Even rather then better
get me
I've got nothing to loose
Look inside
Alone and sad
i torment myself
The world is
Strange to me
my emotions were died
Only wrath, hate
And abhorrence
Were reminded for me
Only one wish
That burns inside
That death calles my name
Get me
Even rather then better
Get me
I've got nothing to loose
