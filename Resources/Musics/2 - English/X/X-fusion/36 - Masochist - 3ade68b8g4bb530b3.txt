MASOCHIST

Pain is what you need
Sorrow is affecting you
Rejection is turning you on
You inclination
Remains misunderstood
Subordination
You relish the torture
Indignity is your addiction
Fault you're reshrugging off
Senses of inferiorty
Are conducting your life

You're getting floated
They are chasing you
In your sick fantasy
You're bleeding to death
You're beaten
They're treating you
You're running in your blood
And you're puling for more

Agony
Let your heart beat fast
Dolor
Make me life a misery
Pang let you feel
That you are alive
Distracted with pain
You're pleading for more
