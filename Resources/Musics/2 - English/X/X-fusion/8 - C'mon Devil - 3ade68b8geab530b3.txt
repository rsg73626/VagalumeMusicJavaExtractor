C'MON DEVIL

Fierce view, starry eyes
Satan lives inside of me
Black heart
Evil Thoughts
My innermost is getting out now
Selfish life
No emotion
I'll never forge close links to someone
Controlled mind
No mood swings
I am my master and my slave

C'mon Devil
Hold on tight
C'mon Devil
Feel my pride

Your fuckin' rules
And insane laws
Boy, never try to slow me down
Your existence
Your goddamn wants
I don't give a damn about
Avoid me
Don't bare my way
I'll never miss my target
I carry my point
With or without you
So fuck off and step aside
