DEFILED AND RAPED

dark corner guarded by night 
I'm haunting you to fullfil my wish 
disguised and armed, waiting for you 
to rape your body and abuse your soul 

your fingernails are grating my skin 
bloodcurling screams are begging me on 
your killing glace is raising my greed 
your cold sweat satisfies my thirst 

no relief, no escape 
no salvation 
defiled and raped 

your cries for help will never be heard 
now call my name and pule for mercy 
try to resist, try to get away 
your end is near, accept your fate 

see my cynical smile, you'll never forget 
and my greedy eyes which are disporting 
you're squirming below for nothing 
you got no chance, too bad 

no relief, no escape 
no salvation 
defiled and raped
