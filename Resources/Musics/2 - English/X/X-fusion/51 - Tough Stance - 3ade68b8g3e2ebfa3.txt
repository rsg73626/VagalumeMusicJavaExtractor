TOUGH STANCE

Sick mind attending my soul
Dark abyss deep in myself
Strong drives disposing my way
Deformed veins affecting my life
Wild lust infectd my thoughts
Pur hate restrained my biliousness
Rough score raises my laugh
Reverse sides brushs me off
Take a though stance
Don't accept compromise
Act out your greed
Take my advice
