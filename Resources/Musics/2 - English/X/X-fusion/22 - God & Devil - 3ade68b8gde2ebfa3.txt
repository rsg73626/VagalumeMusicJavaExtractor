GOD & DEVIL

You lived your life without any sin
You had obeyed all the rules you'd know
And your religion instructs your way
The 10 requirements accompanieds your life
You'd never spoke a bad word to someone
You never had evil thoughts in your head
You loved the priests you thought they never lie
You only saw a well world a well world
The gate you want through
WHere is the old man?
The Person you prayed to
Is god and devil in one
