DEAR GOD

My lust
My hate
You can't ban my thoughts
My feelings
My sences
You can't control my mind
No chance
Dear god
You'll never break
My presistance
My view
My concept
You can't plant my faith
My will
My deeds
You can't cause my path
Good lord
I hate you
Heaven Knows
I shit on you
no chance
Dear god
You'll never break
my resistance
