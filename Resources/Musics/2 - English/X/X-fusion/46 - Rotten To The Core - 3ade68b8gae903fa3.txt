ROTTEN TO THE CORE

I am the lie 
that glares in your eyes 
you are my liar 
who takes my commands 

I am the fear 
that drives you insane 
you are the jerk 
who toes the line 

I am the hate 
that strokes your force 
you are my hater 
who wages my war 

I am the violence 
that lets you assault 
you are my brave 
my soldier and slave 

Rotten to the core 
I am your curse and your decay 
I rape your mind and feed upon your ruth
