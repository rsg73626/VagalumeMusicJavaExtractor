ASHES TO ASHES

Narrow escape
Out of your world
The only way
To rid of my hate
A useless fight
Against my fate
Desperate quest
To suffer my pain
My darken mind
Damned to exist
Caged in a shell
Of blood and flesh
My pitch-black heart
Contrained to feel faint
Nothing could aid
Just my dying reliefs
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
My black-blooded mind
Escapes from my past
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Leaving your world
In boundless disgust
