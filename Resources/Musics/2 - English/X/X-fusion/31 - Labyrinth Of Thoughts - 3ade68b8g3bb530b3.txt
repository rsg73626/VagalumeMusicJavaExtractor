LABYRINTH OF THOUGHTS

Where is my way
And what is my aim
Is there a mission
Thats calls my name
What is allowed
And what is not
And who affects it
Is it you
or your god?

Labyrinth of thoughts
No perceptions
No return

What is wrong
And what is right
Or am I
Mystified
By my sight
Tell me the answers
Tell me the truth
So many questions
I'm totally
Confused
