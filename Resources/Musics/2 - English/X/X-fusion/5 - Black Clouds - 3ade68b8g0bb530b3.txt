BLACK CLOUDS

Many years
Of experience
Many years
And thousand strokes
Many years
And million of thoughts
Many years
Dashes my hope

Ruined life
Raped soul
Death
Is my only wish
Black clouds
Darken my world
And colour my
Perception

Hard lines
White lies
I'm losing my
Subsistence
No way
To deter me
Decay is my last will
