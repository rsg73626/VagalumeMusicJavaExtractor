GUILTY MASS

We fear the truth
Avoid intelligence
Surveyed our problems
And ever think small

We don't have an own will
Stand ourselves in away
We pay each price
Need no liberty to live

We are the people
We are the mass
Everthing's shit
We are the guilty ones

We're thoughtless ignorants
No individuals
The leaders takes our power
Religion takes us sake

We're uninterested
Will never understand
Accept all rules
Provoke the end of the world
