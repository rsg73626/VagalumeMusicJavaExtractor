INDUSTRIAL DREAMS

Industrial fury
Industrial sound
We'll rock this place right to the ground

Pounding drums and pumping bass
The look of anger in your face

Lights and action hit the floor
Speed and power, give me more

Molten mayhem, tempered steel
Love to hear the vocal squeal

Fast and loud
Loud and proud
Gotta rock hard
To please the crowd

Fast and loud
Power trip
Now's the time
To let it rip

Spikes and leather fill the hall
Really want to please you all

Armored fists, I see them shake
How much can our bodies take?

Sound of industrial in the air
Time for you to get your share

Industrial fans fill my dreams
Love to hear your industrial screams
