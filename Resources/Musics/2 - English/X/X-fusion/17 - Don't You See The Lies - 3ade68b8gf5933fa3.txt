DON'T YOU SEE THE LIES

Ignorance and prejudice
Raping people's mind
Molded by environment
Hatred of all kinds

Never knowing tolerance
The ignorant domain
Never knowing freedom
Wear it like a chain

A life of hate is useless
You don't have a cause
Breeding hate with no excuse
Starting racial wars

Religion teaching lies
Hypnosis of the weak
Believing in false prophets
Slaughtering the meek

Don't you think?
Don't you see?
Don't you fool?
Don't you see the lies?
