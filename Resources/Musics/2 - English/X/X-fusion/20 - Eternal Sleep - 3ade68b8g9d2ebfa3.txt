ETERNAL SLEEP

Broke out in sweat
I woke up
Trembled with fear
From reality
Alone in the dark
Without you
only memory
Keeps grounding me
It was only a dream
Which was gladden me
Awakening depressed me
My only wish
Eternal sleep
Eternal sleep
With my all world
My prime-age is gone
The zest of life
has died years ago
I gave up
Devil-may-care
It doesn't makes a diffrence
If i live or die
It was only a dream
Which was gladden me
Awakening depressed me
my only wish
Eternal sleep
Eternal sleep
