THEODICY

aren't you able 
to abolish the evil? 
or is it your weakness 
that lets you fail? 

don't you want 
to solve our problems? 
yo you're the Lord 
who serves in hell

but if you want 
and you're not able 
who provides the right 
to call you God? 

I will believe 
in your existence 
if you demonstrate 
your divine ability
