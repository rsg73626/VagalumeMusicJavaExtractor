TRANSITION OF POWER

You've got no opinion
Nothing to say
You are blind like the others
believe what they pray
You believe in everything
But you don't know
You're only able to see
What they want to show you
You're conception of the world
Is not approximately true
Your sensless live
Is not controlled by you
You're manipulated
From hidden force
You're only one of millions
They controll your thoughts
You don't look through
You don't analyse
you need leaders
Who determine your life
You're coneption of the world
Is not approximatly true
Your sensless live
Is not controlled by you
