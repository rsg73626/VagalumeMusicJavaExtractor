PITCH BLACK

innocent and unconcerned 
unaware but satisfied 
empty headed and asinine 
brainless with a silly smile 

one step forward, two steps back 
your future seems to me pitch black 
one step forward, two steps back 
follow my ideas off the beaten track 

unperceived but clearly here 
what you can't see you cannot fear 
a pack of trouble you don't care 
as you are no doubt aware 

one step forward, two steps back 
your future seems to me pitch black 
one step forward, two steps back 
follow my ideas off the beaten track 

with little steps they rape your life 
with wide steps escaping the truth 
changing your tomorrow needs a plan 
sharing of your sorrows abates your pain
