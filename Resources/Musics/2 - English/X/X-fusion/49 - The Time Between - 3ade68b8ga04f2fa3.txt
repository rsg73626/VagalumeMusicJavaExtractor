THE TIME BETWEEN

Struggling through
Disturbing life
Your only aim
Is to survive

To understand
The reasons why
You want to know?
You'll rather die

Tension pulls
The joy is gone
You can't believe
You're missing the fun

You've got a life
You never want
You can survive
But do you want?

We're born
And we'll die
The time between
Will let you cry

Using your soul
Fight against fate
Create something new
A world without hate

You shall remain
To change the world
But if you don't
Live with the hurt

Suppress your fear
Forget your fright
Choose your way
To win your fight

And if you win
Your soul is free
And you can live
Your fantasy
