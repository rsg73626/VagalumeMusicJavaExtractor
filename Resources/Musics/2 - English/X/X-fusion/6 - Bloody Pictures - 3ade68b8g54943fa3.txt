BLOODY PICTURES

deadly tornados desolate a land 
but I live far away 
a sick criminal rapes a girl 
a girl I don't know 
freak waves are destroying coasts 
looks great 
can I see it again? 

a train derailled - many people died 
no problem for me, I wasn't in 
a murder shoots his victim down 
hey boy, perfect shot! 

bloody pictures in news and tv 
but I don't care it's not a picture of me
