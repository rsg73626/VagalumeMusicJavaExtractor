I DON'T WANT

To close my eyes
To ignor the lies
To hide my tears
To forget my fears
To slow down my pulse
To see the truth
To supress my hate
To loose my fate

I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want

To be your slave
To build my grave
To feel the pain
To get insane
To control my wrath
To stop the excess
To save my flesh
To heal the gash

I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
