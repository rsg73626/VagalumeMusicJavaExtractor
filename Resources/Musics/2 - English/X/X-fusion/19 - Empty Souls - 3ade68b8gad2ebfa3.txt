EMPTY SOULS

You are dead
Rotting skin
Decaying skulls are caving in crying out
Set me free
Torturing the inner me
burning soul
Black with hate
Searching for one to taste
one last look
with bloody eyes
Dying world without disgrace
Empty souls
Forbidden fate
Sould will die with endless hate
Mortal thoughts
Flowing blood
No you're sure, there is no god
Feasting fear
Emotionless eyes
Now or never you wont feel nice
Denying faith
Evil comes
Grabs you by your rotten face
