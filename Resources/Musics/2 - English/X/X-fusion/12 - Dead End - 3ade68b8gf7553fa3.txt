DEAD END

where is the place, where everything began? 
where is the place, where everything will end? 
here is the place, where everything went wrong 
where is the place, where I belong? 

dead end 
your world isn't mine 
dead end 
borders are defined 
dead end 
I have no doubt 
dead end 
there's no way out
