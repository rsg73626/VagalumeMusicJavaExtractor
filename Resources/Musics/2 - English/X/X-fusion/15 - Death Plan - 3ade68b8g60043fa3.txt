DEATH PLAN

our aim is rotting in hell 
without dying 
life makes no sense 
only the greed 
advances ourselves 
the quest for money, 
power and sex 
because of death 
we'll use our tide 
we're only bridging 
a fucking time gap 
we're detracting 
from the unavoidance 
don't wanna see 
the absolute truth 

the hate, the fate, the fear and the tear 
the ruth, the pain are parts of the plan 

carnal fragile 
we're damned to disease 
mental violative 
ever close to suicide 
the avarice let us walk uproad 
we're killing lifes 
from friends and foes 
the plan of death 
never forgets 
the days of fate 
are numbered by pain 
the soul is tortured 
by a vicious circle 
the spirit is willing 
but the flesh is weak
