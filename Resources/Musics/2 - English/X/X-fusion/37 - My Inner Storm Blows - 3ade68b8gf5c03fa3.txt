MY INNER STORM BLOWS

deep inside but still alive 
a will to kill a will to destroy 
the flame still burns 
and my lust returns 
a will to afflict 
my mind to distress 

sparing you 
is not my volition 
sparing you 
is not my aim 
sparing you 
is not my volition 
sparing you 
is not my aim 

my scorn in current 
against all of you 
my hated fiends 
our world needs 
to be cleaned 
the wrath in me grows 
my inner storm blows 
it's hard to control 
you stupid asshole
