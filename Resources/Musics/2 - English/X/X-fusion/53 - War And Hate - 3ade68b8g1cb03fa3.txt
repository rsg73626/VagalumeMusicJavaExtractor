WAR AND HATE

I am the violence
Which flows in your veins
I am the dark side
Of your conscience remains

I'm the relection
Of death on the earth
I'm the expression
Of hate and rebirth

I am the madness
Which controls your brain
I am the image
That makes you insane

I am the darkness
That lets you feel sad
I am the sickness
That lets you wish you were dead

War and hate
That's why I relate
