DEAD LOVE

I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate

Suffering pain deep inside
Left her arms her cold parade
Her cold soul is frezzing me
I'm falling down I'm falling deep
She was she that liveth and was dead
She had the keys of hell and of death
Her cold fingers froze my soul
I fell and I watched me go

She burnt my skin with her fiery eyes
SHe broke my heart with her deceiving lies
All my love is gone with her list
Yesterday I have her my last kiss

I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate

Suffering pain deep inside
Left her arms her cold parade
Her cold soul is frezzing me
I'm falling down I'm falling deep
She was she that liveth and was dead
She had the keys of hell and of death
Her cold fingers froze my soul
I fell and I watched me go

I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
I hate to love
And i love to hate
