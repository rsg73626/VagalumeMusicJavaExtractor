MY REVELATION

I close
My eyes
And follow my dreams
Taken away
By thoughts of bitterness
Deep shadows
In my soul
No senses in my heart
Mental abysms
Are haunting
My existence

I am not the one
You think to know
Outside alive and kicking
But inside broken down

My past
Comes closer
And spits me
In my face
Events recures
They'll never let me rest
My will
To live
Is lost since many years
My road
To ruin
Know no resort for me
