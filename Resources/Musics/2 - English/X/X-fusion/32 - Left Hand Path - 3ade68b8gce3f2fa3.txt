LEFT HAND PATH

I am no slave
Of the society
Don't go conform
With your world view

I do what I want
To get what dues to me
Yes I am different
Any problems with that?

You got no
Identity
I curse
Your existence

I spit
On poor little souls
We erase
The primitive nation

Left hand path
Unique mind
Left hand path
Cherished awareness

Left hand path
Getting stronger
Left hand path
Vary from the brute

The evil wins
The well looses ground
I don't approve
Shame or take fright

I make a difference
Without any help
I embody the bad
No charity for the mass
