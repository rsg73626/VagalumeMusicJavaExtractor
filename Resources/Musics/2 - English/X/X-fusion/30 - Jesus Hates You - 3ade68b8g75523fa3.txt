JESUS HATES YOU

I'm Jesus Christ
Hear my holy lies
Got only one device
See my greedy eyes

Fool the poor and the weak
To the light they seek
Sell the blessings for
50 dollars or more

Love to see them cry
Watch them slowly die
Lead every war
For a better score

I don't care at all
If they stand or fall
If you're dead of alive
The fact is I will survive

Jesus hates you
Jesus hates your fucking life

I am Jesus Christ
Can't you see the light?
I preach the holy way
Join or be my prey

Look up into the sky
All my psalms are a lie
Want to see me die?
Wanna crucify?

Plot a way for the destruction
Of the earth
To plague, starvation and diseases
I gave birth

I let them all die
'Cause my will is the law
I'm your mighty God
And I love the war
