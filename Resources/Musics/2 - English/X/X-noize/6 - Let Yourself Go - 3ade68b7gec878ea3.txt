LET YOURSELF GO

"Everybody makes the wrong mistakes
Day in day out, it all feels the same
You always put your head inside the sand
So follow me, I'll make you understand

You gotta free your soul
Gotta let yourself go
Let the electric beat flow

You gotta feel the soul
You gotta let yourself go
Let the electric beat flow"
