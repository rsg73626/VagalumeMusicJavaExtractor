CLOCKWISE

Time is passing by and it's always clockwise
I was on the run and you know, it's clockwise
Try to keep up with your game, break the record once again

And it's all the same so you runaway(2x)
Wash it in the drain and get away

Don't stop, don't wait, it's yours to take
And it's all the same so you runaway
Wash it in the drain and get away
You know it's time, you feel, you know it's time...

Don't stop, don't wait, it's your to take!
