OUT LOUD

You hit the ground
and breath it out loud
riding on the waves of sound
you might be lost
and you might be found
let the bass move the ground (2x)

hit the ground
and breath it out loud

WATCH ME NOW!!

you hit the ground
and breath it out loud
siding with the shapes of sound
you might be lost
and you might be found
raise yourself and move around
visions come clear in the element
flying with the wings of time(life)
you feel the pulse get electrify
dancing in the wave of sound

hit the ground
and breath it out loud (6x)
