IT'S GOIN' DOWN

Com Mr Hahn E Mike Shinoda

Watch them flee
Watch them flee
Watch them flee
Hip-Hop hits
And you do it like this

It's goin' down (It's goin' down)
It's goin' down (It's goin' down)
It's goin' down (It's goin' down)
It's goin' down 

It's goin' down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage 

Pre-Chorus:
It's goin' down
The logical progression on a the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's goin' down 

Chorus:
Put it out for the world see
LP and X-men to the 10th degree
It's goin' down
Nobody in the world to see
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down
Put it out for the world see
Me and x-men to the 10th degree
It's goin' down
Everybody in the world to see
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down 

Put put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
It's goin' down 

Once again it is
Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board with this blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest is the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
The elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's going down
Stalence emulation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop 

Pre-Chorus:
It's going down
A logical progression on a the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now, it's going down 

Chorus:
Put it out for the world see
Me and x-men to the 10th degree
It's going down
Everybody in the world to see
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down
Put it out for the world see
Me and x-men to the 10th degree
It's going down
Everybody in the world to see
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 

X-men 'bout to blast off world wide
X-men 'bout to blast off world wide
And you do it like this
'Bout to blast off world wide 

Chorus:
It's Goin' Down
Put it out for the world see
Me and x-men to the 10th degree
It's goin' down
Everybody in the world to see
When we melt down the acts wax in the wet decree 
It's goin' down
Put it out for the world see
Me and x-men to the 10th degree
It's goin' down
Everybody in the world to see
When we melt down the wax in the wet decree 

It's going down
Put put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
It's going down
Put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
