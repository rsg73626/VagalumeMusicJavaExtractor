GOTTA LET GO

Yeah.

Here I come,
Here I go.

I know I need to get on my knees,
You know I've been so lazy, lazy,
Been running, doing just as I please,
You know, it gets so crazy, crazy.

No more messing around,
No more chasing all over town,
I know where I should be found,
Down on my knees, I'm beginning to see...

That I gotta let go,
Gotta let go of the things that I hold,
Gotta let got, whoa,
Gotta let go all life long.

I know that when I'm away from you things can get so hazy, hazy,
I can tell just but the things that I do...and 
I don't mean maybe, maybe.

No time for messing around,
No more of me playing the clown,
I know I'm gonna be found,
Down on my knees, I'm beginning to see...

That I gotta let go,
Gotta let go of the things that I hold,
Gotta let got, whoa,
Gotta let go all life long.

All life long.
The time's a-wasting, with things to be had,
Times are changing, and they're looking so bad,
No refuge if I'm on my own, but I got a place that I can call home.
I'm going home.

Ooh, yeah,
Oh.
Yeah.

I'm loving spending all this time with you,
You make everything alright, alright,
No more of me playing the fool,
I'm gonna fight the good fight, good fight.

I'm finished messing around,
Breaking the chains that kept me so bound,
You know where I can be found,
Down on my knees, I'm beginning to see...

That I gotta let go, whoa,
Gotta let go of the things that I hold,
Gotta let got, whoa,
Gotta let go all life...all life...all life long.
