N-A-LYSE

The next try is up to you
Don't talk with your hands
I feel your heart so blue
See my world through my eyes
Another story starts
Don't move me up and down
Aren't you satisfied? 

You're analyzing me
I cover what you need
You're analyzing me
To come in to my world 

The next try is up to you
Don't talk with your hands
I feel your heart so blue
See my world through my eyes
I can laugh at you
But you can't laugh at me
If I would say to you 

You're analyzing me
I cover what you need
You're analyzing me
To come in to my world
