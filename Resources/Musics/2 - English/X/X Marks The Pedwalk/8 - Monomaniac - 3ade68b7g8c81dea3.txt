MONOMANIAC

I move around
The silent sounds
I move around
I have to energize my languor 

Understand my sight and 
feel the crash into my hole
You can call me monomaniac but 
I will tell you it's medacity
I'm moved by fear and the ground so near
You can call me monomaniac but 
I will tell you it's medacity 

My view so clean 
while the sounds have been so clam
You can call me monomaniac but 
I will tell you it's medacity
I move around from side to side
You can call me monomaniac but 
I will tell you it's medacity 

I move around from side to side
You can call me monomaniac 
when will I reac the ground to cry
Cold ground, silent sounds, I move around
I have to energize my languor
