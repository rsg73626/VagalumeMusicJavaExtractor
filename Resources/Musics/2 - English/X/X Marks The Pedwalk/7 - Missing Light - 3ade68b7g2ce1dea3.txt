MISSING LIGHT

A to and fro of tempers in you
You know the sights you're looking for 

Visualizing the truth is not like a mirror
Realizing the fear is to break through the walls 

It feels like
In a dark room
Forever missing light
Silence
To search for
A neverending might 

Behind the walls an unknown world
It has nothing to do with delight
