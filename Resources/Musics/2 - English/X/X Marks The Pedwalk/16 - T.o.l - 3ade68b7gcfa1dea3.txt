T.O.L

I hope you can see, I'm looking down the sea
Expecting emptiness
I hope you can see, I'm falling down on my knees
I need the taste of love 

I don't have enough time to time accept my feelings
Want to get inside what I know as light
Do you know the line where I can move on
Please give me a sign that I can understand
