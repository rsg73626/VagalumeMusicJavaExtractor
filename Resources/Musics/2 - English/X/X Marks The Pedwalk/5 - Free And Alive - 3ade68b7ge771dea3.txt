FREE AND ALIVE

Everytime I try to understand, 
I feel my burning mind
I couldn't talk to you I need you, 
I feel a burning inside
Cold wind in the air, 
my hands through my hair
Don't want to keep my view aside, 
just want to look inside 

Until the sun relieves the moon, you have to cry
And when you wake up you will try
To feel free and alive 

The mood is trance-like
Sometimes sleepless, I need a real life
The walls so near, the light too slow
My fear is all I hear
Show me how to feel if you know how to feel
All I want is to believe you know, 
in something I won't leave
