DRAWBACK

Some fine tunes from nowhere
I rush at the gap
A returning might to
Extinguish the light
Extreme my eyes open wide and I dive
Into a psychosis behind a haze

A headlight on me, I feel ravished and clean
Some kind of instinct, impressive, rules me
Anxious to know why I rummage out lies
I move systematic, out of the light

It's not real
Just a drawback I wish to feel
When lies come near
And the time rules what I hear

I locate a place that will mirror my face
And inquire into the mash of myself
There's a wish-wash in my head, a wit in my mind
I don't think that's real, a drawback of time

A headlight on me, I feel ravished and clean
Some kind of instinct, impressive, rules me
Anxious to know why I rummage out lies
I move systematic, out of the light

It's not real
Just a drawback I wish to feel
When lies come near
And the time rules what I hear

A headlight on me, I feel ravished and clean
Some kind of instinct, impressive, rules me
Anxious to know why I rummage out lies
I move systematic, out of the light
