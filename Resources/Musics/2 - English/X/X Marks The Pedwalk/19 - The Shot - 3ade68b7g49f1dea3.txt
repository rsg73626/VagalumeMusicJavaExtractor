THE SHOT

Deep aggressions caused a disease.
You don't know what to choose.
You don't know why you loose control. Impressions pelt on you take that gun take that way taste the fun to give away yourself.
Capture that object it's the right a shot will correct all.
You only see your sight you know this is the last way there's nothing to regret so you laugh at your disease and kill it with a shot.
A shot will erase the background.
A shot will erase the circumstance.
A shot will erase the guilty ones.
A shot will erase what you have found.
A shot will kill the disease.
