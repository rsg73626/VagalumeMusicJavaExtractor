SWASTIKA

Weakness apathy to yourself gloom looking for a kindred for years.
You were a muff.
You fell into mud.
You ran for a change.
You rap your fingers and rap out of your house out of your past raze it to the ground.
You hide in a way out and think there is nothing to shout.
Your hide makes you blind and all you find seem to be friends of your mind. Self-confident and organized you are part of them but now you realize you see what they have done and recognize the swastika the stretched out arms. What did you do?
