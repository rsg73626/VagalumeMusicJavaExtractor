REPRESSION

One second and you are not prevalent. Your repression is not obedient.
Look in that mirror of yourself.
Read pages of a book pages of your life.
Listen to a story that cuts like a knife
times and emotional lies out of your life.
Repression is not obedient.
Repression, take that knife.
Repression is not your life.
