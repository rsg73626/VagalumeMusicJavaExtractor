SPECIAL SIGN

I'm lookin down lookin down to the floor
I'm staying here looking down 
looking back try one step
I'm waiting for a special sign
I'm waiting for a special sign 
to fill my dreams with light 

I'm staying here looking back try one step
I can't hear I can't cry tears are mine
I'm lookin down lookin down to the floor
I'm staying here looking down 
looking back try one step 

I'm waiting for a special sign
I'm waiting for a special sign 
to fill my dreams with light
