TIME TUNNEL (PHASE TWO)

Edd tide flow
It's a natural might
Rules my day and night
And the way to go 

Realize when the waves come in
Passing times and land to leave steps in life

Atmospheres and expecting quiet
Like a divine voice it holds life rhythm tight
It's not in sight but it covers your mind
It's a leading light you'll never hide

It's the turn of the tide
