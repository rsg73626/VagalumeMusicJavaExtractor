REPLICA

Seem right, seem wrong
Only difference is that I'm that one
Second time a wrap
Feels like this song's already been sung

Mirroring situations like you're an imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to, I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?

They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical

25 and you're just like me
Is it in my nature to be stuck on repeat?
Another encore to an aftershow
Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?

Mirroring situations like you're an imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to, I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?

They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical

Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?
Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?

They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical
