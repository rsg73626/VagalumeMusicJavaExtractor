OUR SONG

All I have, I will give to you
And at times when no one wants to
I will give you me
And we'll be
Us

All I have, I will give to you
And at times when no one wants to
I will give you me
And we'll be
Us

And there's no one else
That knows me
Like you do
All I've done, you've done too
The walls I
Hide behind
You walk through
You just walk through

Well I know all the words
To take you apart
You know I know you're hurt
I want to mend your heart
You broke down
Why don't you tell me from the start
You know I know you're hurt
I want to mend your heart

And there's no one else
That knows me
Like you do
What I've done
You've done too
The walls I
Hide behind
You walk through
You just walk through
