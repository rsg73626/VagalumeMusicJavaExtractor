HOT LIKE FIRE

Hotter than a summer's day in California
You got me meltin like a sundae, I want ya
I know you've been waitin', you've been waitin' a long time for me
But if you wait a little while longer this is how it'll be

It's gonna be hot like fire
Take you higher
You can't resist
Kiss, kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss

You shouldn't have said "take your time"
I'll let you know when I'm ready if that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you, I won't keep you holdin' on
But if you wait on me, I promise you it won't be long

I'm gonna take you hot like fire
Take you higher
You can't resist
Kiss, kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss
