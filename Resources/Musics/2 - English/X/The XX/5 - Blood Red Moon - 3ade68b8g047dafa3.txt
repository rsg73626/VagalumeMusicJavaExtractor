BLOOD RED MOON

Picture me under blood red moon
I'll make your eyes turn yellow
Make your skin turn blue

Picture me under blood red moon
I'll make your eyes go yellow
Make your skin turn blue

I know, I know, I know
That it's hard to see
I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know
That you're all I see
I know, I know, I know

Picture me under blood red moon
I'll make your eyes turn yellow
Make your skin turn blue

Picture me under blood red moon
I'll make your eyes go yellow
Make your skin turn blue

I know, I know, I know
That it's hard to see
I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know
That you're all I see
I know, I know, I know
