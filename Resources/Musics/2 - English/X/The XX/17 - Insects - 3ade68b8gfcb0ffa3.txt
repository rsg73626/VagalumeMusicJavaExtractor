INSECTS

Those eyes 
Those eyes 
Those eyes 
Those eyes were sharp like sharpest knife.

When I see you and I'm going away 
You help me get to the things that you will do 
And say when I see you and I'm going away 
You help me get to the things that you will do 
And say

Those eyes 
Those eyes 
Those eyes 
Those eyes were sharp like sharpest knife.

When I see you and I'm going away 
You help me get to the things that you will do 
And say when I see you and I'm going away 
You help me get to the things that you will do 
And say

And I feel 
And I feel 
And I feel 
Like an insect 
(and i feel) 
You make me feel (and i feel) 
You make me feel (and i feel) 
Like an insect

Leads to no nowhere 
Coats on your chair 
Like an insect
