ON HOLD

I don't blame you
We got carried away
I can't hold on
To an empty space

Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold
I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold

My young heart
Chose to believe
We were destined
Young hearts
All need love
Call it a lesson

The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
