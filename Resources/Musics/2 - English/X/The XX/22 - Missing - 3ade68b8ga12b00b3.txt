MISSING

[Hook]
My heart is beating in a different way
Been gone such a long time and I feel the same
My heart is beating in a different way
Been gone such a long time

Will you miss me (How did I, how did I how did I, oh)
When there's nothing to see? (How did I, how did I how did I, oh)
Tell me, how did this come to be? (How did I, how did I how did I, oh)
And now there's no hope for you and me

[Hook]

Do you still believe (Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh)
In you and me? (Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh)
Are we all we could be? (Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh)
Is it meant to be?

[Hook]

My heart is beating in a different way
Been gone such a long time
