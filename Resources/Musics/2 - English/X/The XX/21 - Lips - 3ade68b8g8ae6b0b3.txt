LIPS

[Intro: Trio Mediaeval]
Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul
Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul
Just your lips

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
My name on your lips
Your air in my lungs
Drowned in oxygen
Now you've set the scene
High on intimacy
Drawing me above

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna know the way down
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna know the way down

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft Oliver Sim Trio Mediaeval]
Just your love
I just want it all
Just your shadow
Just your voice
I just want it all
And my soul
In my head, in my veins
In the way you give and take
In the weight that you weigh
On my body, on my brain

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
Chemistry is rare in a two, three-time affair
There's no guarantees
Working through the seasons, pressed up against the ceiling
Pushing down on me

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim]
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna know the way down
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna know the way down

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft Oliver Sim Trio Mediaeval]
Just your love
I just want it all
Just your shadow
Just your voice
I just want it all
And my soul
In my head, in my veins
In the way you give and take
In the weight that you weigh
On my body, on my brain

[Outro: Trio Mediaeval Oliver Sim]
Just your neck
Just your eyes
Just your desire
Just your love and my soul
Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul
Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul
I don't wanna know the way down
