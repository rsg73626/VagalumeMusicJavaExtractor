PERFORMANCE

If I scream at the top of my lungs
Will you hear what I don't say?
If I dance like I'm on the stage
Will you see I seem out of place?
If I put on a disguise
Will you think everything's alright?
If I leave before the end
Will you forget that I was there?

You saw me leaving
Did you think I had a place to go?
Since you stopped believing
I've had to put on my own show

I'll put on a performance
I'll put on a show
It is a performance
I do it all so
You won't see my hurting
When my heart it breaks
I'll put on a performance
I'll put on a brave face

Even when I was hurting
You could always find me
Now you've stopped looking for me
But I'm still playing hide and seek
I want you to notice
But you just don't see
The show is wasted on you
So I perform for me

So I perform for me
So I perform for me
So I perform for me

I'll put on a performance
I'll put on a show
It is a performance
I do it all so
You won't see my hurting
When my heart it breaks
I'll put on a performance
I'll put on a brave face
