LAST CHRISTMAS

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
So this year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognise me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Happy Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now
I`ll know you've fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
OOh Ooh
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
So this year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
So this year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
