BASIC SPACE

Neck, chest, waist to floor
Easy to take, you could take me in fours
Make me a deal, a day a piece 
Take it all, just stay a week

I'll take you in pieces 
We can take it all apart
I've suffered shipwrecks right from the start
I've been underwater, breathing out and in
I think I'm losing where you end and I begin

Basic space, open air
Don't look away, when there's nothing there

I'm setting us in stone 
Piece by piece, before I'm alone
Air tight, before we break
Keep it in, keep us safe

It's a pool of boiling wax 
I'm getting in
Let it set
Got to seal this in
Can't adjust, Can't re-learn
Got to keep what I have, preserved

Basic space, open air
Don't look away, when there's nothing there

Hot wax has left me with a shine
Wouldn't know if I'd been left behind
Second skin, my second skin

I can't let it out, I still let you in 
I can't let it out, I still let you in
