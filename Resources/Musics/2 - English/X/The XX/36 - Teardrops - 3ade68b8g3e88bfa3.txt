TEARDROPS

Whenever I hear goodbyes, reminds me baby of you
I break down and cry, next time I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance reminds me baby of you
And I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true,
I'll be true, I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

And the music don't feel like it did
And the music don't feel like it did
And the music don't feel like it did with you

When I'm dancin' 'round, reminds me baby of you
And I really let you down, next time I'll be true
I'll be true, I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor
reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

And the music don't feel like it did
And the music don't feel like it did
And the music don't feel like it did with you
