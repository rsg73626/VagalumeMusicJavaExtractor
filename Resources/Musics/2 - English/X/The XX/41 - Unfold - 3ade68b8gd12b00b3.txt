UNFOLD

Am I blind
You move your hand away from mine
I take it as a sign
That you're any less than mine
Oh, it doesn't move me to be cold
It doesn't lessen my hope
You know our time and all

Oh, let it unfold
I won't leave it untold
The feeling goes on and on and on

In my head
You tell me things you've never said
And I choose to forget
And take the good and leave the rest
Oh, the illusions getting old
And you don't answer when I cold
I would have given you it all

Oh, out of sight out of mind
It doesn't mean you're not mine
The feeling goes on and on and on
