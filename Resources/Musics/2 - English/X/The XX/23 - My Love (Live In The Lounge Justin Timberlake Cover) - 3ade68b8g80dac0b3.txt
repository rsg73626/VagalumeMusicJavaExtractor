MY LOVE (LIVE IN THE LOUNGE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE COVER)

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me
(What would you do?)
If I told you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular
(Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(say "I do")

Yeah, Because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
my love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
my love

Ooh, love
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
(What would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team
(Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point of waiting anymore?
Cause girl I've never been more sure
(That baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
(Just say it "I do")

Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

My love
My love
All I want you to do is be my love
My love
My love
All I want you to do is be my love
