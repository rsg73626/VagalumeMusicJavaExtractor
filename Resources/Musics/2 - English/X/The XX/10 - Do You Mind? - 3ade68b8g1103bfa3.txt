DO YOU MIND?

Tell me I need to know,
Where do you wanna go,
Cuz if you're down,
I'll take it slow,
Make you lose control

Baby would you like,
To spend the night,
The whole night,
And maybe if you play it right,
You can be all mine

Do you mind if I take you home tonight,
Stay another day,
If that's okay,
Tell me baby,
Would you mind if I take you home with me,
Where no one can see,
So don't be shy

Night, night, night, the whole night

Night, night, night, the whole night

Baby,
I like your style,
So lets get it on,
When we touch,
I can't get enough,
I'm falling for you,

Honey would you like,
To make love tonight,
The whole night,
And baby,
If you play it right,
You can be all mine

Do you mind if I take you home tonight,
Stay another day,
If that's ok,
Tell me baby,
Would you mind if I take you home with me,
Where no one can see,
So don't be shy

Night, night, night, the whole night

Night, night, night, the whole night

Do you mind if I take you home tonight,
(night, night, night, the whole night)
Stay another day,
If that's ok,
(night, night, night, the whole night)
Tell me baby,
Would you mind if I take you home with me,
Where no one can see,
(night, night, night, the whole night)
So don't be shy,
(night, night, night, the whole night)
Baby
Honey
(night, night, night, the whole night)
Baby
Honey
(night, night, night, the whole night)
