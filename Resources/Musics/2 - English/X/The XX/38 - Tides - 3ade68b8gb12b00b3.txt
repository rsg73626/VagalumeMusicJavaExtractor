TIDES

[Hook]
You leave with the tide
And I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes
Some things that lost their meaning

Devote to me
Alone with me
Say with me
"Why would you ever want to leave?"

[Hook]

Fade out of view
I wouldn't do that to you
I wouldn't just leave us alone
When we could be close, close, close

Hold me close when you could leave us alone
Why would you just leave us alone
When we have been close, close

[Hook] x2
