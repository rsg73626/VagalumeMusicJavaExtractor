SWEPT AWAY

I get swept away
When I think of you
Take me to that place
Where it's control I lose

I'm soothed by you, you take it all away
I lose to you, surrendered at the start of the game

I'll never deceive
We're right here, always been

Hide away, I hide away with you
I let the world just slip away
I'm left with you

Your little masquerade, I'm sure of the mood
The moments we've shared
Always ended too soon

Part of you stays a while
Even when you're far away
How so far away, yet you feel so near
