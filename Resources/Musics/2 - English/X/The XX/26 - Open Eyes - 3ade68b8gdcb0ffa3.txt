OPEN EYES

Open eyes, see for me 
Undisguised please help see 
It's enough, it's too much 
No, I lost faith, I found loveâ€¦

Tonight I could lose the fight 
But with you by my side,
Everything will be alright.

Closed my mouth, words fall out 
Come and save, words and bout 
You can tell if something's wrong 
I've been here but I've been gone

And the skies don't seem so bright 
With you by my side
Everything will be alright.
