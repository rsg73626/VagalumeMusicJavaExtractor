DROWN

Drown 

Mistaken i was 
and taken from here
I couldn't breath for many years
This is the end there is no way
to get the hell out of this place 

This is the reason why i'm drowned
i hope to see you all around
my faith is screaming suffocated
maybe you're the next to be hated

No one understand myself 
i am losing all my health
I can't tear inside my heart
instead i show you all my scars

This is the reason why i'm drowned
i hope to see you all around
my faith is screaming suffocated
maybe you're the next to be drowned... 
 
Get ready...to...Drown...Down!

lose your breath
lose your last breath
lose your breath
lose your last breath
right now...

This is the reason why i'm drowned
i hope to see you all around
my faith is screaming suffocated
maybe you're the next to be drowned..
 
Get ready... to drown!

Be drown..and down..
you drown..just down..
right now...Be drown..
and down..you drown...
