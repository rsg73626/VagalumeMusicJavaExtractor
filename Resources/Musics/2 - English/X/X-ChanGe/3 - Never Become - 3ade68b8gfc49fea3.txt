NEVER BECOME

Never become

Never i will become 
i won't be blind..
Never i will become
althrought these lies
Never i will become
those fools they are
Never i will become 
tied!!!

I have my own face
i won't lie
beside the truth
we always hide
or left behind 
something to try 
interrupt your mind
it's our crime ...

We feel decide...
I can't to scream
who  will become the next VICTIM?
to be control, won't leave this shit
who will become the next flesh meat?

I can't to choose my way to go 
because i'm only one alone
my way away  this mess I'm in
i've already head my fate...
If we go on, we'll losE this ride again
If we move on, we'll step outside this damn

We feel decide
I can't to scream(I can't to scream)
who  will become the next victim? (Me??!!)
to be control, won't leave this shit (Me??!!)
who will become this piece of meat? (Meeeee??!!)

----
Be yourself
Think for yourself
trust yourself
win for yourself!!

Feed!!(BE)
Feed!!(...COME!!!)x2

We feel decide
I can't to scream(I can't to scream)
who  will become the next victim? (Me??!!)
to be control, won't leave this shit (Me??!!)
who will become this piece of meat? (Meeeee??!!)x2
