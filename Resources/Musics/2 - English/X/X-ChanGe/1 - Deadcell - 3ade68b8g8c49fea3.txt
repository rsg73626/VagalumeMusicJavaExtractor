DEADCELL

DeadCell

Cold deadcell!!

You know as well
what I have felt
For feeling down
for someone else

Holding you down 
keeping you Down...
Throw out your mask
I've got to figure you out
Keeping you down 
keeping you Down...
Will grow the hate inside myself
I will breakout!!! I'll break down...
Everybody jumpin'
to the fuckin' ground
Holding you down 
Fuckin' you all
I'm screamin now 
you've freaking out

I see my face 
under the line
when I've decide...

Holding you down 
keeping you Down...
Throw out your mask
I've got to figure you out
Keeping you down 
keeping you Down...
Will grow my hate inside myself
I will breakout!!! I'll break down...
Everybody jumpin'
to the fuckin' ground
Holding you down 
Fuckin' you all
I'm screamin now 
you've freaking out

Step up (BREAK YOU DOWN) 
You get up (BREAK YOU DOWN)
and make up another theme (BREAK YOU DOWN)
Wake UP,  and scream to all you can to break (BREAK YOU DOWN)
even when the dark hold you to the ground(BREAK YOU DOWN)
face your fears
and leave this sickness ASIDE...

AI EN ES EI EN E... (insane)
i can see my dead cell
under  my skin!!
You dispite me away
Fuck you, I say...

You Suck...

I can see my dead cell
awake..
You dispite me
awayyy...

Holding you down 
keeping you Down...
Throw out your mask
I've got to figure you out
Keeping you down 
keeping you Down...
Will grow my hate inside myself
I will breakout!!! I'll break down...
Everybody jumpin'
to the fuckin' ground
Holding you down 
Fuckin' you all
I'm screamin now 
you've freaking out
