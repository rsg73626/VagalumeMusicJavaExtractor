CRAWLING IN YOUR MINDS

Sitting here I watch mankind,
Living in a land of fears,
Drowning in a lake of tears,
Live their lives on cries

Sitting here I feel your pain,
I see the scars upon your arms,
I touch the darkness of your hearts,
I know your life is all in vain.

Crawling in your minds, I have touched your souls,
Emptiness is what I found.
Crawling in your hearts, I have found your goals,
Cruelty and lust they shout.

But now I ran away from here,
From the land of fear and tear,
Running fast inside the night,
A beam of light I'll try to find.

Can't find your goals and so do you,
I think of you as a mindless corpse,
For me some ale is quite enough,
In songs to live my life.

Crawling in your minds, I have touched your souls,
Emptiness is what I found.
Crawling in your hearts, I have found your goals,
Cruelty and lust they shout.
