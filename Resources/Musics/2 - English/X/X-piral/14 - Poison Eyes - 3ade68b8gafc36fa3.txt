POISON EYES

Come inside I'll show you my life,
My personal hell that you have made.
Twisted brain you've poison eyes,
Buried in your pretty face.
You've burned down a part of me,
Maybe better now this way.
Beware! The time's now closer,
The time has come for you to pay.

Poison Eyes.
Staring down a thousand cries
Sinfull Eyes.
Vomiting a hundred lies

Time to pay my beloved one,
Now your sins tears you apart.
Bloody dreams in haze you're lost,
Your heart is pounding in the cold.
Magic flames your soul they shatter,
I'm the wizard the spell caster
The time is coming meet your doom
Come and face the endless gloom

Poison Eyes.
Staring down a thousand cries
Sinfull Eyes.
Vomiting a hundred lies

Die for your sins,
Cry for your life,
Pay for my dreams,
Pray now it's time.

Come to me and feel me
And all those tears I've been
Shedding for you all those years
I've been lonely.

Winds of despair
Blow strong tonight
Shattering my life
A lifetime of lies

Desire now burning
Desire now burning
Desire now burning
Desire now burning me down
