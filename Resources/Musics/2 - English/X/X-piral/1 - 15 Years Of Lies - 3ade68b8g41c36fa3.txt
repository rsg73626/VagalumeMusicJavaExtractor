15 YEARS OF LIES

At first in a castle,
But not as a king,
It became a jewel
But not in a ring

Said it was in fear
But not in fright
Felt like is some tears
But not as I have cried

Appeared like a ghost
But not from the dead
It became a nightmare
But not as I was slept

Try, I'm trying to find a way
Lies and sorrow thrown away
Try, I'm trying to fly away
Fifteen years of lies now are burned away

Seemed like an enigma
But not in a mystery
My fate they try to guide
Fifteen years I'm forced to hide

Said it was a serpent
But it can also fly
I think it is a dragon
And it will never die

They say it was for me
Bur I was never involved
Seems all is a mystery
Yet to be solved

Try, I'm trying to find a way
Lies and sorrow thrown away
Try, I'm trying to fly away
Fifteen years of lies now are burned away

Fifteen Years of Lies
Feeding up my brain
Fifteen Years of Cries
Crushing down my fate
