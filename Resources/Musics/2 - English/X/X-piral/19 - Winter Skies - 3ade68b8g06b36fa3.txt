WINTER SKIES

The morning wind comes through my hair
A magic spell so simple,
Drops of rain come down on me
The gift of life so feeble

Is it so hard for us to believe?
Trust our inner voice.
Will this be the end of time?
Do we have a choice?

Winter Skies so pale and cold
Winter Skies so vague and bold
Like an eagle to the rainbow fly
Spread up your wings on a cold winter sky.

My eyes filled with sorrow as a stare the sea
And tears slowly falling revealing my grief
The dragons the elves they all do exist
But all remain hidden feared by our greed

Winter Skies so pale and cold
Winter Skies so vague and bold
Like an eagle to the rainbow fly
Spread up your wings on a cold winter sky
