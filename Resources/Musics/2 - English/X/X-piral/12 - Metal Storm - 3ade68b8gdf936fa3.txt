METAL STORM

Power and steel demolishing rage,
Glory of metal I'll take to my grave.
Baptized in fire, forged in the heat,
Be ready to taste the force of my fist.

Metal Storm

Clouds gathered near, cracked is the sky,
Metal beasts rising to fight by my side.
Red eyes of anger spilling your blood,
Metallic axes rip out your heart.

Metal Storm

Riding on the winds of a metal storm
With power and fury I'll smash down your world
Thunder and lightning over my head
By flames made of metal you shall be cleansed

We're all standing tall never to fall,
All now united to conquer the world.
Our warcries are heard our hands we raise high,
By power of metal we ride to the sky.

Metal Storm

Born in a metal
Baptized in a metal
Ride on a metal storm
