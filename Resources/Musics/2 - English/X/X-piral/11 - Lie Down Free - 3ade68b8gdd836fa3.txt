LIE DOWN FREE

Massive strikes, your brains run out
Fire burning in the ground
Hell now rise its coming up
Charge them now! The speakers shout

Run, escape the ground is shaking
Mountains crumbling from within
From a button fall like flies
Seduced minds the key to win

Crying, falling, feel the pain
See the nonsense in your gaze
Tell me now whose friend or foe
When's your turn your eyes to close

You left too soon they will all say
Staring out with teared sad eyes
But they will send a thousand more
To lie down dead right by your side

You'll fight for freedom and all rights
Preaching out and we believe
We shall all go and fight and die
And in the end we'll lie down "free"

Crying, falling, feel the pain
See the nonsense in your gaze
Tell me now whose friend or foe
When's your turn your eyes to close
