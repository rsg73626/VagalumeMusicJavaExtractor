POWERLUST

See, the end is near and
Hear, the trumpets sounding
Run and save your lives and
Fear, fear the powerlust!

See them flying, in the moonlight shining
Wings of steel they cross the sky
Spreading fire uncontrolled desire
Lust for power rapes the human kind

Iron melting, feel your life is ending
Walk upon the thinnest line
Fire rain falling, rushing out for glory
Violent cut of your timeline

See, the end is near and
Hear, the trumpets sounding
Run and save your lives and
Fear, fear the powerlust!

Mothers crying, holding withered children
Soldiers running for their lives
As the ground is cracked now, mother earth is screaming
Thunderstorm falls from the skies

Mankind falling, in vain their lust for glory
All of them now lay down dead
Ripper's here, inexistence near
And the end of powerlust!

See, the end is near and
Hear, the trumpets sounding
Run and save your lives and
Fear, fear the powerlust!
