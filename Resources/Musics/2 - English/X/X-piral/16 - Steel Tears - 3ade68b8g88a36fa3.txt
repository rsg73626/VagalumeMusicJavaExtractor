STEEL TEARS

Running fast through wastelands,
Devoured all by your kind.
Smell of death around me,
And tears flood my eyes.

I gaze down the horizons,
There's no sun to shine.
Earth now is screaming,
And I feel drowned my life.

I feel the end is near,
From your machinery.
I see steel tears are,
Glowing shine eternally.

Come and see the world is burning,
Doomsday now has come.
Run and hide from your creation,
They all have come to life.

I see your blackened soul fades,
Dust it leaves behind.
And my mind exploding,
Cannot stand your crimes.

I feel the end is near,
Our mother now she dies.
I feel her tears are falling,
Like raindrops in the night

Come and see the world is burning,
Cleansed in fire and ice.
Come and see, steel tears are falling,
Piercing my mind.
