DEAD WITHIN

You, you who stare me now
An empty gaze within your eyes
Noble cause exchanged for lust

You, you who hear me now
Sucked up brains within your head
All your life has turned to dust

There's no way,
To be free
On this earth
No control

There's no way
To feel free
No escape
Run alone

You, you who crawled in vain
You who dared to claim the power
Insanity burns your eyes

You, wieldind wisdom lost
You who reigned upn all cost
Feel the flame burn you eyes

There's no way,
To be free
On this earth
No control

There's no way
To feel free
No escape
Run alone

You, you who heed my call
Just like sheep you come along
Hope for Eden's road

You, you who lay now dead
Late you learned the rules
The road to Eden's closed
