COM - FUSION

Living day and night
Plugged and fused with wires
Never know what's going on

Your needs to satisfy
And your senses to keep high
Going deeper loose control

Vacant days of wandering without face,
All you've got digital silence.
Signals on the screen. Void inside your life,
Fused with wires you show defiance.

The clock is ticking fast
And you feel a chilling touch
Metal running through your veins

Your dream has now come true
With the network you are fused
Reality has gone astray

Vacant days of wandering without face,
All you've got digital silence.
Signals on the screen. Void inside your life,
Fused with wires you show defiance.

Time...
Is running fast,
Cables through your brain they measure life

The walls
Are closing in
Your body plugged inside four walls, paralyzed can't see your fall!

And your mind
Is so com-fused.
What is real, what is fake, all mixed up inside your head.

Vacant days of wandering without face,
All you've got digital silence.
Signals on the screen. Void inside your life,
Fused with wires you show defiance
