PLAINS OF PERFECTION

Running your life through boredom and pain
Searching for light through thunder and rain
The plains of perfection never you'll reach
For empty words always you preach

Speaking of justice but justice is lost
Speaking of honor a thing they ignore
Grown old but nothing you've learned
Crawling you'll pray when near is the end

The rivers the valleys the seas and the hills
Wonders of earth that you want to kill
Proud for crimes you smile out and laugh
But earth will avenge may god be with us

Speaking of justice but justice is lost
Speaking of honor a thing they ignore
Grown old but nothing you've learned
Crawling you'll pray when near is the end

The woods that we burn and seas we pollute
Avenging their death, their ghost we salute
Mankind repeating mistakes it has done
Forever repeating 'till this world is gone

And when every single tree we have burned
And lake to toxical waste we have turned
Will be the day when alone we'll crawl
Our souls are rotten downway we fall.

Speaking of justice but justice is lost
Speaking of honor a thing they ignore
Grown old but nothing you've learned
Crawling you'll pray when near is the end
