FALL INTO OBLIVION

Fall into oblivion, everlasting,
Eternal darkness I feel upon my soul
Sparks of white light passing,
In my mind I hear them call..
I fall into oblivion, but my soul rises high

Can you hear my name?
As I follow the great light .
Fear and pain
In this strange lifeless flight
All life fading
A distant shape remains
Every single day
A silhouette of lost emotions

All the things I left unfinished, all the things I kept unsaid
On my journey through the river, the point of no return?

Sparks of white light passing,
In my mind I hear them call..
I fall into oblivion, but my soul rises high

And my soul now flies away,
A withered leaf on winter dawn,
Northern winds lift me up high,
To the place were I'll reborn

Soon I will return,
for this life it is too short,
A new vessel will now host me
Lusting for eternal life

Blinded by rage
Sunked in deepest sorrow
Confusion of change
Nightmares bright, dreams that hide
And I feel so lost,
Trapped inside this endless corridor
Memories beside
My weak companion through time

Sparks of white light passing,
In my mind I hear them call..
I fall into oblivion, but my soul rises high

And my soul now flies away,
A withered leaf on winter dawn,
Northern winds lift me up high,
To the place were I'll reborn
