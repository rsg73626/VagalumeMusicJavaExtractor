HUNTERS

Dive into the crystal sea of dreams
A secret world of shadows will be revealed
Sailing on with the ship of life
Wondering what is wrong or right

The clouds of existence are holding your soul
The quest is now ahead
Hunters of the mind harmony
The sands of time run flow
As you hold ï¿½em inside your hands
As your travelling so far away so far away from home

And the quest is now ahead....i know...

We're the hunters of
The light of the stars
We're the hunters of
The power of the earth
We're the hunters of
The blow of the wind
We're the hunters of
And we set the elements free

Fantasy is the weapon of the mind
Use it well for all the tracks you find
Ethereal wolves are howling tonight
A hunter knows the right time to strike

The clouds of existence are holding your soul
The quest is now ahead
Hunters of the mind harmony
The sands of time run flow
As you hold'em inside your hands
As your travelling so far away so far away from home

And the quest is now ahead....i know...

We're the hunters of
The light of the stars
We're the hunters of
The power of the earth
We're the hunters of
The blow of the wind
We're the hunters of
And we set the elements free

Free to the universe we all fly away, we wil fly away!
