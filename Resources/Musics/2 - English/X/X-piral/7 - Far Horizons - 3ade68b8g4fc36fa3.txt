FAR HORIZONS

I lay down and dream of
A better world to be
With open skies all blue
And lakes of water clean

I pave on the mountains
Where eagles fly high free
I wish I had a pair of wings
Aside with them to be

Mother earth now is calling me
Father sky he cries my name
So I leave you all and fly away
To a brighter sun and a brighter day will come

I will fly to far horizons
See from high above our world
And I'll leave this world of emptiness
In my hands my destiny I'll hold

I will fly to far horizons
See from high above our world
And I'll leave this world of emptiness
In my hands my destiny I'll hold
