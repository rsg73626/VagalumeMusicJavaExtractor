DUAT (LAND OF THE DEAD)

Strong magic cast, round a circle of power
Two souls now fly, to the valley where death reigns.
Darkness impales, and the winds they blow cold
Approaching the throne, where your soul shall be waged

Back in the time when empires ruled the land.
And the sun God decides the fate of men.
To the underworld ride,
Answers to find!
Back in the time when a scarab pushed the sun,
In the land of the dead, a scale now commands.
Sins now are paid,
Justice prevails!

The door-keeper stands, guarding the hall of Osiris
The dead in a line, against the Feather of Truth
When a heart's on the scale, it decides your fate.
The door keeper awaits, what the judgment will be!

Father I'll show you the fate of the liar
His soul has been waged banished in Fire
Power and glory don't matter in this lands
Your heart will be tested, the scale never lies!

And the two stood watching, as the march passed by,On the first all power and glory, and slaves and gold.On the second the tenderness of heart.
Envy filled his soul for the power but his son's voice sounded heavy into his mindEnvy not the power, Father, for his fate now lies unknown, and his evil shall be paid, and his sins shall be brought fourth. And his wealth will matter no

Back in the time when empires ruled the land.
And the sun God decides the fate of men.
To the underworld ride,
Answers to find!
Back in the time when a scarab pushed the sun,
In the land of the dead, a scale now commands.
Sins now are paid,
Justice prevails!
