HEAR ME CALLING

Nighttime is falling, falls down on me.
An empty place holding all what I dream
An empty seat waiting for you to return
A page I can't turn

Alone i wander wastelands, of shattered broken dreams
Of feelings unforgotten, still lurking inside me
Still echoes in the distance, your frozen last goodbye
A scar I cannot hide.

I never will forget the smile upon your face
The light that used to shine, so bright upon my days
In darkness I'll forever now, keep wandering alone
And my heart feels cold

Come and wake me up,
Repent the dark and cold
Lay down beside me,
Let warmth inside my soul
On shining white skies
We'll fly together again

Hear me calling out your name
in silent screams of pain
Drowned in the morning haze
I'm lost without a sign

See me running in the rain
In my mind a stain
Never goes away
