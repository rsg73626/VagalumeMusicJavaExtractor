TIMECHASER

Feel the sands of time, drowning you inside,
Trying to steal the light of day.
Race to the finish line, fight to beat the time,
Playing on a set up game.

This life is not what you have dreamt,
Back in time you wish you went!

Chorus:
And now you're chasing the time, you're burning alive,
Bursting desire!
Back! You have to go back! Drown in your past,
Feeling so tired!

Timechaser!

Your life is running fast, leaving you behind,
Scared, a mockery of man.
Howl in the lunar light, for all you've left behind,
All your dreams die inside your hands.

This life is not what you have dreamt,
Back in time you wish you went!

Chorus:
And now you're chasing the time, you're burning alive,
Bursting desire!
Back! You have to go back! Drown in your past,
Feeling so tired!
