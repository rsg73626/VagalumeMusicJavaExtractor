any day is good for me to go and kill a ho
so fuck the money, mo murder mo murder mo
and it's a nightmare on yo' mama's street
but freddy's bitch-ass is dead, so now you got ta deal wit' me
and ain't no need to make no part two, three or fo'
'cause i'm gon' kill 'em all in that first episode
slit 'em open with the straight razor
killin' 'em quicker than that mother fucker pinhead on hellraiser
i'm hellbound so the X-raided loc ain't no joke
when i creep i use that nine-millimeter to split yo' face wide open
'cause nigga you know i got no brain

i'm full of that liquor i'm stickin' my trigga unloadin' da shit sicc
so psychoactive nigga bangin' the deuce-fo' s t r to the double e t
don't tell my nina you seem to be incubate
and i ain't trippin' 'em all that payback shit you ripped in jail
by then i'll have that nine to make that brain thang hang out, nigga

when you runnin' up on the X you better bring your favorite preacher witchya
'cause you gon' need him to be a witness when i smoke ya
