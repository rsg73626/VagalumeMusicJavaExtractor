RETALIATION (COMING FOR ME)

[x-raided]
Niggas is coming for me from all directions whole court the streets
Fuck the police we never call protection
I'm right here mothafucker i aint hard to find
Them niggas you came with riding they aint as hard as mine
I heard a bitch nigga say raided needs to die
Wanna see raided dead what's the reason why
Retaliation, revenge for convictions and murdered ones
I'm in the pen one phone will murder ya son
Your homeboys is bitch-made dont even speak with the ??
Its deuce four six eight rip your teeth out ya face
I walk a daughter cross a nigga never roded up [??]
Selenas valley ride time never folded up
So who da bomb x cazenscy? raided
Una bomb future mind mad man shot caller like juvalon super don
Sin capater capture attack niggas capital punishment
Dumping bodies in sac rivers

[chorus: x-raided]
Niggas is coming for me
Where can i go what can i do

For the shit we did to they crew
And now they hunting for me retaliation on they mind
But i'm waiting for them with dessert eagles and tech-nines [x2]

[kingpen]
Niggas is coming for me retaliation for past sexes
Niggas is gunning for me because of ?????
Niggas is hunting for me locating me and black sacks
But aint got nuthing for me stay straped nasty and fat sacks
Get me ?? i know these niggas play for keeps
They wanna catch me slippin by and lay a nigga six feet deep
But peep i'm a savage in these co streets like jay joner
So bring the yellow tape and the white cheeks around the corner
These niggas gonners if they call us when the wars on
Return the streets into a warzone full of chrome
Desert eagles moving ? in the reaker about that nigga and his people
Kill em all wont be no sequel because i'm lethal like street nine
Lunatic wit a sick mind like manson
Empty the clip 187 dancing
Leaving them lethal creeping why you creeping with a mask on
Kick in the door and get my blast on

[chorus: x2]
