THE BIG L

Everywhere I go
all the faces that I know
see them standing back to back
getting ready to attack

It makes you incomplete
but it makes you feel so sweet
yeah your mind is set on it
gonna hold your body tight
it's gonna take you for a ride
it's gonna take you through the night

You can feel it in the air
baby everywhere
it takes you up and gets you down
moves you all around
it will chill you to the bone
miss it when it's gone
it takes you up and gets you down
it is there for you to be found

Baby baby I don't know
where to run to where to go
gotta find me the right key
that opens up the love in me

You're feeling good and bad
just like the ones you've had
got my mind set on it
it'll turn your right to wrong
you'll turn from weak to strong
yeah you've got it going on

You can feel it in the air
baby everywhere
it takes you up and gets you down
moves you all around
it will chill you to the bone
miss it when it's gone
it takes you up and gets you down
it is there for you to be found

It makes you incomplete
but it makes you feel so sweet yeah

You can feel it in the air
baby everywhere
it takes you up and gets you down
moves you all around
it will chill you to the bone
miss it when it's gone
it takes you up and gets you down
it is there for you to be found

You can feel it in the air
baby everywhere
it takes you up and gets you down
moves you all around
it will chill you to the bone
miss it when it's gone
it takes you up and gets you down
it is there for you to be found
