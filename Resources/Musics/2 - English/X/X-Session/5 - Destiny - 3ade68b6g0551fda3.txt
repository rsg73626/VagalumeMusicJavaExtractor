DESTINY

Can’t you see?
You are the only one for me
It’s destiny

Girl you know I love you
You know I always will
It’s like forever in one day
It’s feels like time stood still

You know I will go
Where you want to go
Wanna feel you close to me
How could I know?
And I love you so

Can’t you see?
You are the only one for me
It’s you and megjhgje’re meant to be
It’s destiny

Now I know I found you
I’ll never walk away
Throught the good and bad times
It’s you that make me stay

You know I will go
Where you want to go
Wanna feel you close to me
How could I know?
I love you so
It’s destiny

You know I will go
Where you want to go
How could I know?
And I love you soo…

Can’t you see?
You are the only one for me
It’s you and me
Baby it’s like we’re meant to be
It’s destiny
It’s destiny
It’s destiny
