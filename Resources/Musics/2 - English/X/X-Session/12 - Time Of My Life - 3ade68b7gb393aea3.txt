TIME OF MY LIFE

Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
I'm having the time of my life

There's something
so it can't be wrong, baby
You'll always be
My only number one
Oh yeah

I hear the knocking on my door
and wonder who's outside
You're always coming back 4 more
maybe cause you're satisfied

Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
I'm having the time of my life

I feel my heart
beats out of time, baby
One look at you
gives shivers down my spine

I hear the knocking on my door
and wonder who's outside
You're always coming back 4 more
maybe cause you're satisfied

Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
I'm having the time of my life

I hear the knocking on my door
and wonder who's outside
You're always coming back 4 more
maybe cause you're satisfied

Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh Oh Baby
I'm having the time of my life
