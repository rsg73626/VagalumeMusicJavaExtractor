BACK TO YOU

This situation is going round and round
there's something up
but I won't go back down no
There's only one thing that you say 2 me
"You belong to me"

And I'm tired of all the tension
and the games he wants to play
with my mind
and I don't need his attention
just standing in the way
seeing his reflection
makes me turn and walk away

I don't care, I do mind
Don't you waste my time
I don't care, what you say
( I) ain't coming back no way
I don't care, I do mind
don't you waste my time
I don't care, I'm no fool
(I) ain't coming back to you

This situation
it blows me out of my mind
one day I said I loved you
but I left you behind
Cause the love has gone
( it) walked out the door
You're begging please
but it's gone for sure

And I'm tired of all the tension
and the games he wants to play
with my mind
And I don't need his attention
just standing in the way
seeing his reflection
makes me turn and walk away

I don't care, I do mind
Don't you waste my time
I don't care, what you say
( I) ain't coming back no way
I don't care, I do mind
don't you waste my time
I don't care, I'm no fool
(I) ain't coming back to you

I don't care, I do mind
I don't care, I'm no fool
I don't care, I do mind
I don't care, I'm no fool
(I) ain't coming back to you
