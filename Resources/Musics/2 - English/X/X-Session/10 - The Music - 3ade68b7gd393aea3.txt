THE MUSIC

Look into my eyes and see
what you really mean to me
baby try to understand

It takes you round and round
the music takes you round and round

Look into my eyes and say
if you'll ever come my way
if you're coming back to stay
And I don't know what to say or do
cause I don't have love
if I don't have you
I know
you are
going to be my star

The music takes you round and round
the music takes you up and down
it takes you round and round and round

Check it out or check it in
say your prayers or prepare for in
let it go or take my hand
All that I should do
all that I should know
all the places that I need to go
Maybe it's better us being friends
I just hope you understand
It takes you round and round
the future takes you round and round
and I don't know what to say or do
cause I don't have love
if I don't have you
I know
you are
going to be my star

The music takes you round and round
the music takes you up and down
it takes you round and round and round

The music takes you round and round
the music takes you up and down
it takes you round and round and round
