THE SOUND

Move to another dimension
your heart is beating
cause you feel the tension
don't you know what's going on
in my mind
it's the sound
I hear it all the time

Does it get to you
now that you've lost control
no more power
over your hart and soul
take a little walk
from coast to coast
it's the sound
that you love the most

It takes me up
to the top we'll go
coming down
like a river flows

Turn it around, turn it around
your feet don't touch the ground
you'll never beat the sound

Slide and walk in the same direction
the mirror glows
with a strange reflection
if you see what I see
if you know what I know
than you will let the sound
take control

Let it in, let it out
let it go all the way
you gotta raise your voice
and state your clame
seeing is good
but to me perfection
is the sound
it's giving me direction

It takes me up
to the top we'll go
coming down
like a river flows

Turn it around, turn it around
your feet don't touch the ground
you'll never beat the sound

Turn it around, turn it around
your feet don't touch the ground
you'll never beat the sound
