CAN'T LET GO

I've been driving around all night
wondering what to do
the music on my radio
it only reminds me of you
I've been waiting all night long
I know you won't let me down
you know I can't stop
till I've reached the top
I just wanna hear that sound

I can't let go
yeah babe
I wanna know you're mine
cause I need you so
Babe I can't let go
I can't let go
yeah babe
I wanna know your mine
cause I need you so
and babe I can't let go

Satin sheets on my bed
it's empty as can be
I often think of you for a while
yeah I want you close to me
I've been waiting all night long
I know you won't let me down
you know I can't stop
Till I've reached the top
I just wanna hear that sound

I can't let go
yeah babe
I wanna know you're mine
cause I need you so
Babe I can't let go
I can't let go
yeah babe
I wanna know your mine
cause I need you so
and babe I can't let go

I can't let go
yeah babe
I wanna know you're mine
cause I need you so
Babe I can't let go
I can't let go
yeah babe
I wanna know your mine
cause I need you so
and babe I can't let go
