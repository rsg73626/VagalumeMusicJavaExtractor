BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN

Is it my imagination?
but this ain't right
just a sick intoxication
Docter, gimme life
you're feeling lost
but no you'll never let it go
cause you don't know who you are
no you don't know who you are

Rocker rocker

Father father

Is it true what they're saying?

You're feeling hopeloss

cause you don't know where you are
no you don't know who you are
