I NEED YOU

Well this is the way I feel tonight
come on and let me
you don't have to say it's wrong or right
I feel electric
I can't say no without a smile
I can't say so, without a sigh
I feel I lose control
but I don't know who you are

I need you
I need you
like the summer needs a sun (like the winter needs the snow)
Oh babe
the more I touch your skin
the more I need you

Well this is the game we play tonight
come on and let me win
unable to say it don't sound right
just start undressing
I can't say no without a smile
I can't say so, without a sigh
I feel I lose control
but I don't know who you are

I need you
I need you
like the summer needs a sun (like the winter needs the snow)
Oh babe
the more I touch your skin

I need you
I need you
like the summer needs a sun (like the winter needs the snow)
Oh babe
the more I touch your skin
