RISE OF A NEW SUN, PART 2: SUNRISE

Is it light that I see?
Is it hope that I feel
Do I still bleed
Or have my wounds healed?

I think I'm ready
To start again
So now I ask

Come to me spirit of light
Wake me up from this dark and cold night
My ceaseless sleep shall come to an end
Let the old sun shine again on this land

(Come to me)

Sun of freedom
Burn my laziness
Make my will outgrow my fear
Give me strength to carry on
Free me from temptations
Show me determination
Don't let me give up my goals
Shine in my soul

Shine in my soul
Forever inside me
Leave me in the dark no more
Sun of my life

Time to wake from the nightmare
Time to rise from my ashes
The light I see is now real
Not only memories and flashes

Awake and now fine
It's my time to come back
All this power is mine
And I will never lack

Gotta show them I'm here
Alive and unbeaten
With no scars and no fear
Not alone and not hidden

Come to me spirit of light
Wake me up from this dark and cold night
My ceaseless sleep shall come to an end
Let a new sun rise and shine on this land

(Come to me)

Sun of freedom
Burn my laziness
Make my will outgrow my fear
Give me strength to carry on
Free me from temptations
Show me determination
Don't let me give up my goals
Shine in my soul

Forever inside me
Leave me in the dark no more

Cause I won't look behind
By this light I'll be led
With a dream in my mind
I will fight till I'm dead
