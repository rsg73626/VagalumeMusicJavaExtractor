METAL FOR DEMONS (FEAT. DETONATOR)

For demons your life
For demons your soul
Death and sacrifice
For demons "aruê aruô"

For demons a cat
For demons the cow
Head of the bat
For demons all now

For demons without you
For demons with you
For demons inside you
For demons you're cool

We begin the ritual
For demons with our pals
With sacrifice for demons
And metal for you all

We begin the ritual
For demons with our pals
With sacrifice for demons
Metal!
For all!
For all!

For demons underground
For demons in the sky
For demons all around
For demons till you die

For demons under bed
For demons even dead
For demons everywhere
For demons in your head

Smart demons, fool demons
Demons of fools
All kinds of demons
For them you're cool

We begin the ritual
For demons with our pals
With sacrifice for demons
And metal for you all

We begin the ritual
For demons with our pals
With sacrifice for demons
Metal!
For all!

For them your body
For them your soul
For them your life
For them you're so cool
For them you're so cool
For them you're so cool
For them you're cool
