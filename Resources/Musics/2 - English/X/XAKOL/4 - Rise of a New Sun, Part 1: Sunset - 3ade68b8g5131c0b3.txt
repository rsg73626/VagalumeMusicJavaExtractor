RISE OF A NEW SUN, PART 1: SUNSET

My life was a beautiful story
As a walk on a sunny and green park
Used to listen to the sound of my glory
Until when everything turned dark

Clouds came
The sun faded
My life changed
Not the same
I faintedm with the pain

To the evil force I lost this fight
It left me unconscious on the ground
Now my life is a never ending night
Although I still have friends around

For years I've been sleeping
And couldn't wake
For years there's been no chance
That I could take
There has been only darkness around here
I haven't seen any light in years
But what is this that's passed by my eyes?
Something tells me to stand up and fight
