ON THE RADIO

I hear a song on the radio
I hear it since I have to date
I hear this song on my way to work
I hear again and again

But it's kind of strange
It's kind of strange
It feels like dejá vu

Some people go straight from work
Some people go on and get drunk
I don't know which side I'm on
I don't know what's going on
But it's

It's got to be
It's got to be
I should get home and straight

Here right now
(here right now)
To the sound
(to the sound)
Of the street
(of the street)
To the beat
(to the beat)

So here right now
(here right now)
To the sound
(to the sound)
Of the street
(of the street)
To the beat

Hear this song on the radio
I hear it since I have to date
I hear this song on my way to work
I hear again and again

But it's kind of strange
It's kind of strange
It feels like dejá vu
