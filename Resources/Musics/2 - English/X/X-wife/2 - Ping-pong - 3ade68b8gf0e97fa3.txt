PING-PONG

Well I, 
I rely on you
Not all the time
But when I needed you

Well I was wrong
Just to feel this way
But I was right
When you heard me say

But I don't feel 
I always should
It's in my head
It's in my blood

You know that I don't feel
I always say
changed my head,
changed my name

it's not enough,
Not enough

So, some say it's true
You changed your mind
You let it through
But I get by
Just live this way
What kind of lie do you wanted?

But I don't feel 
I always should
It's in my head
It's in my blood
