THE GATE

You are fallin into the ipocrisy
you bastard leave your face away
I can't, won't see you
and your fucking life

Inside I can't remember my everything
inside I can't remember my nightmare
inside me I can't find the new way

I want to kill'em all
to kill the people left piece of shit like you
you bastard I've so much hatred

Inside I can't remember my eyes
inside I can't remember my everything
inside me I'm nothing

This is your fucking neek
out of my space
this is my last gift for you
my endless

Confused reborn
die reborn now
fuck off peace of shit
no one mutafukka stands in front of me

You mutafukka stay away from me
I am full of hate like above
I am your nightmare
