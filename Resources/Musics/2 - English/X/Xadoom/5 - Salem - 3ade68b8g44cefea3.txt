SALEM

Your soul is lost
is burnt in hell

You liar
your faith is death
you brathe the filth
your fuckin justice
the darkness is comin'
up your face
the death you have given
your fuckin hand

You have Isengard
in your mind
why I can unforgive all your liars

Time is past
the tears are blood
the world is burnt
the burn you love

Your soul is lost
is burnt in hell

You liar
your faith is death
you brathe the filth
your fuckin justice
the darkness is comin'
up your face
the death you have given
your fuckin hand

You have Isengard
in your mind
why I can unforgive all your liars

Time is past
the tears are blood
the world is burnt
the burn you love
