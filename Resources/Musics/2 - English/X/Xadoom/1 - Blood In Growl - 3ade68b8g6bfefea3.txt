BLOOD IN GROWL

darkness is the future
the solution for my mind
I can't remember what's the glory of the light
cause the desperation is the resource of the past
I can't believe in the glory of the dust

This the truth
Of my sorrow
Isn't my death
Not enough

This is my pain
Like a dream
I can't wake up
I can't live

bleeding on my place,desolation of my soul
I want to reborn in the blood in my growl
screaming against the sky, in my prayers, all the day
screaming whitout the voice, in this nightmare before

This the truth
Of my sorrow
Isn't my death
Not again

This is my pain
Like a dream
I can't wake up
I can't live

I feel this rain,
over my head,
I see your eyes
I see the end

walk in the fire/everything/goes down
screaming soul/everything/goes down
a mask of filth/in fragments/goes down

a lie to live/the last prayer/goes down
decadence/rose/'cause an angel tear...
the story/goes down

walk in the fire/everything/burn
bleeding my eyes whit my hope
goes down-down like the sun with my life

bleeding on my place, desolation of my soul
I want to reborn in the blood in my growl
