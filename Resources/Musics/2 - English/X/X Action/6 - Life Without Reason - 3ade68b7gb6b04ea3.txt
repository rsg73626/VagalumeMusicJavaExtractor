LIFE WITHOUT REASON

WANDERING BY THE CITY STREETS
I SEE LIVES WITHOUT REASON TO BE
RETICENTS PERSONS
LIVES THAT FLOW OFF
IN A MESSY WORLD

VELVETY FEELINGS
SUFFOCATED DESIRES
PRAYS AND LAMENTS
TO NEGLIGENT GODS

IN IMAGINE WHEN I WILL WANDER
IT IS BETTER GOING AHEAD
THAN BECOMING INDIFFERENT
I MUST ALL SURPASS
AND CHANGE THE DESTINY
