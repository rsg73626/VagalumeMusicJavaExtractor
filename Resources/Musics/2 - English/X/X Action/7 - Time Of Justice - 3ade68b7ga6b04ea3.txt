TIME OF JUSTICE

THE MOMENT IS COMING
THE MOMENT IS COMING 
TIME OF JUSTICE

TIME OF JUSTICE
GLORY,POWER AND ARROGANCE
UNDER PILE OF THE SOIL
GOOD TRUE CAN BE EVIL
MAKING A MISTAKE FOR EVERYONE
WITH YOUR SOFT WORDS 
 THE COURAGE OF THE WEAK
WEAKEN THE FEAR
THE COURAGE OF THE STRONG
GET YOU NOBLE
THE FEAR OF THE COURAGE
MAKE YOU TORMENT
WHO DON´T TRY
HOLD ON SADNESS
THERE´S A MOMENT 
THAT YOU BREAK OUT
YOU BREAK OUT
