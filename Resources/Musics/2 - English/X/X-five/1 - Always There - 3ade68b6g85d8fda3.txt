ALWAYS THERE

My place, my home
Is where I don't stand alone
If you just cover me
I walk on running

When you feel dyin' call
The world is fallin upon you
Leave someday
Just call me when you need me
I'll be there

My place, my home
Is where I don't stand alone
If you just cover me
I walk on running

When you feel dyin' call
The world is fallin upon you
Leave someday
Just call me when you need me
I'll be there

Chorus:

Always there
I'm always there
Whenever you just need a friend
I wanna care
I'm tellin you
I'm always there
I'm always there
Don't let nobody let you down alone

My mystery is sealed there inside of me
If I see through you
Then watch what you'll do

Wwhen you feel dyin' call
The world is fallin upon you
Leave someday
Just call me when you need me
I'll be there

Always there
I'm always there
Whenever you just need a friend
I wanna care
I'm tellin you
I'm always there
I'm always there
Don't let nobody let you down alone
