WARRIORS OF THE WORLD

Warriors Of The World
The components of the old system 
Became weakened by the forces of evil 
The rebels had destroyed them from within 
A new system was then formed 
>From the best picked warriors 
In the known universe 
These spirits of everlasting life 
Had pulled themselves together and became invincible to all mankind 

In the darkness of the night 
The warriors shall prevail 
They must fight for the right 
To flee the gates of hell 
They must kill of the demons 
And let their prisoners go 
And letting their courage show 

In the break of day 
In the land of the old 
The hearts of the brave young warriors 
Never grew cold 

They fought for their freedom 
And fought for their rights 
But the bloody battle of life 
Would only be won 
By the warriors of the night 

The warriors of the night 
Fighting for love 
And fighting for the right 
The warriors fighting for love 

The brilliance of these members 
Together was like magic 
A spell no one could 
Break except themselves 

These spirits wanted to share 
Their enlightments 
Together to a whole 
But for them to be successful 
They must use their intelligence 
To overcome black forces 
Which can destroy them physically 
Emotionally and from within
