ROCK'S ALIVE

Rock's Alive
Rock and roll will never die 
Listen to what I say 
Cause rock and roll is still alive 
And it’s here to stay 
Well music soothes 
The savage beast 
Trapped inside us all 
And music lovers, all of us 
We’ll never take a fall 

Chorus: 
Wo wo rock’s alive 

Oh so many years ago 
When rock and roll was young 
People never realized 
That rock had just begun 
Well they said it was just a fad 
And it would go away 
But you and I know rock’s alive 
And it’s here to stay 

If you want it 
And you need it everyday 
Come on do everything I say, ya 
Have a good time 
Throw a party, live it up 
We gonna rock and roll you 
Strut our stuff
