SOMEDAY

Someday
Someday we’ll be together again 
We’ll rock rock and roll forever 
My friend 
We’ll live our lives as free 
As a bird 
We’ll soar so high and never get hurt 

Cause freedom 
Is so hard to find 
Your so wrapped up in policy 
All of the time 
Don’t let your life pass you by 
While you’re still young and free 
So take a chance 
You’ll never know
