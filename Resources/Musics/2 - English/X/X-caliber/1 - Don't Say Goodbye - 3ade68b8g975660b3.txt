DON'T SAY GOODBYE

I see you everywhere
Everywhere I go
But you are blind to me
Your eyes see me no more
I hope I lose my sight
When I think of you
But I still see your face
The face that I once knew

Chorus
Don't say goodbye
They say love is a losin' game
Don't say goodbye
Either win
Or you feel the pain
This time babe
I'm comin back for you
This tame babe
This time you won't feel blue

I try to block you out
I try to close my eyes
But there you are inside of me
With me all the time

Now that I'm far away
And you don't want me back
I guess this is a goodbye
Goodbye, so long, goodbye

So don't you send me away
I'm comin' home to stay
