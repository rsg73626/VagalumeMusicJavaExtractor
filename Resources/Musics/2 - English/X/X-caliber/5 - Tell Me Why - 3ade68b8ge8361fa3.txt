TELL ME WHY

Tell Me Why
Years ago 
When we were young 
We played around 
We had our fun 
But times have changed 
They’re rearranged 
We’re different now 
We’re not the same 
We’re lost in life 
Playing silly games 
But won’t you tell me 
If it’s the same 

Chorus: 
Tell me why 
Tell me why you love me 
Tell me why 
Tell me why you need me 

I’m thinking of you 
All the time 
Those memories 
Are etched in my mind 
I realize now 
The things we lack 
But time is gone 
We can’t bring it back 
We’re lost in life 
Playing silly games 
But won’t you tell me 
Am I to blame
