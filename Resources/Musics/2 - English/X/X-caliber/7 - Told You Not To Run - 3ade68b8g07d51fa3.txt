TOLD YOU NOT TO RUN

Told You Not To Run
How you doin’ 
Standing there 
Well can you hear me 
Do you care 
Well I been down 
Now I’m ready to rock 
And I think about you baby, oh a lot 
Oh, oh, I need your lovin’ baby 

Chorus: 
I told you not to run 
I told you not to hide 

I’m standing right here 
Looking at you 
Well can you feel me 
Feel what I do 
Well I been down 
Now I’m ready to rock 
And I think about you baby
