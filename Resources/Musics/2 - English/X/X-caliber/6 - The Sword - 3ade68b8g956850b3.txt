THE SWORD

The Sword
We drew our swords
And went to war
Fighting for our peace
We took the time
We drew the line
But never did we cease
The enemy we knew so well
Just wouldn? t let us be
We had to fight to prove our might
Survival was the key

I pulled the sword from the rock
Now I? m the one on the top
I pulled the sword from the rock
Now I? m the one on the top

We won the war
We paid the price
With all our brave young men
Letting children die in war
Well it must be a sin
The enemy we knew so well
Just wouldn? t let us be
We had to fight to prove our might
Survival was the key
