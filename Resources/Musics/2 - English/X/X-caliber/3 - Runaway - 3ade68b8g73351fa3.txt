RUNAWAY

Runaway
The reality of growing old 
Is not so far away 
As ageless time goes through my mind 
I let it slip away 
I search inside my head sometimes 
For answers that I need 
Seems I can’t reach far enough 
Inside to find the key 

Chorus: 
And I’m a runaway 
I’m going from town to town 
Yes I’m a runaway 
I’m lost and never found 

I dream of days gone by 
And think of yesterday 
When life was much more simple 
When you were standing here 
And I search inside my head sometimes 
For answers that I need 
Seems I can’t reach far enough 
Inside to find the key
