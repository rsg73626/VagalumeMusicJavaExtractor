THE 1ST

Nanotechnology, cyronic suspension
Dna mapping, clonning a human
Mutant cybernetics, merging man and machine
Euphoric neural nets vs. synthetic logic regime

Cyborg informatics recrafting bodies
Artifical intelligence, C31 operations coding
Multiple data bases, umbilical network
Breath engine, indestructible heart

Refrain:
We are the first of cyber- evolution
We are the first to program your future
We are the first, we are the last...
