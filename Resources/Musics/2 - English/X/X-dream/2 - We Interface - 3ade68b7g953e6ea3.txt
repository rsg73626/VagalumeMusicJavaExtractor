WE INTERFACE

Monitoring devices, know where you go
Mass media, total control
Digital delight, desire in megabite
Data overflow, virtual suicide
This information, is disinformation
Truth is hidden, knowledge forbidden
The structures of power, will delegate
To speak is to lie, to lie is to collaborate

Information streams, simulating dreams
Interactive mind-control, systematic overflow

Monitoring devices, know where you go
Public mind, propaganda show
Magnetic sleep, network addiction
Be absorbed, science fiction
It's pyschological, diabolical
Societies brainwash, hospital
The sun never sets, on cyber-space
Transmit, receive, log on to interface
