HERE WITH ME

Suddenly you take
My breath away
Softly as the wind
The words you say

There's no rush
In my heart
It's a dream
When you are here with me
Here with me

I can hear you call
From miles away
Softly as the wind
The words you say

There's no rush
In my heart
It's a dream
When you are here with me
Here with me

I've been down
Without you by my side
All my life
I just need you to stay
Here with me
