I MISS YOU

It's raining this afternoon
We haven't talked for 10 days
You called me this afternoon
And you left me a message

"please answer me... you know
That I can't hold on without you!
This feeling is nothing new
But my heart is bleeding bad... "

'cause I was afraid
That nothing would change
I turned my back on you
And drowned myself in lies

Now I know you were the best thing I've had
I let you go away and that's the worst thing I've done

Now I am missing you so much
Am I awake?
I am dying down here, alone
God, I want her back!
Now I am missing you so much
Am I awake?
They were lies!

I walk along this avenue
Where we met, do you remember?
It's my first time here without you
And it has never been so dark

I wish you could hear me say

Forgive me
'cause I was afraid
I really thought
That nothing would change
So I lied
I turned my back on you
Now I know

That I am missing you so much
Am I awake?
I am dying down here, alone
God, I want her back!
Now I am missing you so much
Am I awake?
They were lies!

I still love you

It's raining this afternoon
I'm watching the news on channel five
"a sad story this afternoon
A girl committed suicide
