WELCOME TO MY PLACE

Everyone's arrived, we are ready to party all night!
Give'em all they want, we're gonna have a good good time
Summer's almost gone, but it's getting hotter in here!
And if you still don't know the reason
You need another beer

We're losing control tonight
There are no more rules to follow this time!
You're welcome to my place
Don't forget life is too short
So drink up with me 'till we fall down
And welcome to my place

The sun is going down, everything is starting right now!
All those sexy girls, they just make me lose my mind
Bang your head and jump, show us what you've got
And raise your glass but don't waste a drop
It's our fuel for tonight, so lick it up!

We're losing control tonight
There are no more rules to follow this time!
You're welcome to my place
Don't forget life is too short
So drink up with me 'till we fall down
And welcome to my place

Don't waste your time with questions
Leave them behind -don't waste your time
Just let yourself go and do what you want
Without any regret, our life is now!

Imma sing it one more time, so you'll never forget that
You're welcome to my place!

We're losing control tonight
There are no more rules to follow this time!
You're welcome to my place
Don't forget life is too short
So drink up with me 'till we fall down
And welcome to my place
