FIRELAND

Every Land has a cost to the sea
Where the men goes to infinity
Brave new world just like me

Every man has a fate to face
In those eyes you´ll see
His destination is unknown

Every Land has life to bleed
You´ll see it now cause I´ll show
Take my hand and now we go

Refrão:
Can you feel my Heart?
Awakening maybe
There´s nothing true but I´ll find

In the Land where the fire burns
Nothing more can save you
Nothing more but only hope

Shall one more gotta face it´s fate?
Will be show in their eyes?
Can´t you see what´s going on?

That´s the time to choose your way
Can´t you come with me
Step ahead and now we go

Refrão:
Can you feel my Heart?
Awakening maybe
There´s nothing true but I´ll find

To reach it through my life
