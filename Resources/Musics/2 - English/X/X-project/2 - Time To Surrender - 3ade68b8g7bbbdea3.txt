TIME TO SURRENDER

I was afraid of all my life 
I'm alone in to the dark
I'm alone in to the dark 
I could resist 
For all my life 
My desire is so strong
2X

I'm not in reason to found my way
Cause I miss you all
Cause I miss you all the time
I remember the day
Than han I thought running to your eyes 
I remember the day when I left all my pride 
It's time to surrender
