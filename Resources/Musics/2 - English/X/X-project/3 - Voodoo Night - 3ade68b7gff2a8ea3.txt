VOODOO NIGHT

Certain games we cannot play
And things we cannot say
An old religion reborning tonight
You must hold on tight

A god´s banishment will wake up
Spirits of the sea and the rainbow´s one
Your soul is now divided in two
But your mind is still only one

In my dreams I can´t wake till the evil is done
I can turn all things back to you
Raise your hands I still can´t see you

Refrão:
Take your time to dance with the stars
That´s falling from the sky tonight
An evil way is wath we´re waiting for
The sings of a voodoo night is clear
Now and again in your mind

Refrão:
Take your time to dance with the stars
That´s falling from the sky tonight
Another way is what we´re waiting for
The signs of a voodoo night is clear
Is clear in your mind
And in your eyes
