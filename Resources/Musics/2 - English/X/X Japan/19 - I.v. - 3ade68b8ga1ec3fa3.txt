I.V.

Needles are piercing through my skin
I'll tell you the feeling what it's like
Is life just all about deception?

Please don't be a part of a fairy tale,
but you're so young to play with thy own will
Should I trade the breath of my life for freedom?

(In the rain) I'm calling you, dear
(Find the way) Can't you see me standing right here?
(Feel my pain) Life's bleeding from fear
(Find its place) I will give it straight from my vein

Needles are piercing through my skin
I don't fear the fucking life [Whispers]

Don't you ever meant life pass you by
They say as if it takes me somewhere
Just let me swallow the faith by injection
Let blood be rushing to my head, my love

I've played with this game before to find a piece of my true self!
I'm lost within!

(In the rain) I'm calling you, dear
(Find the way) Can't you see me standing right here?
(Feel my pain) Life's bleeding from fear
(Find its place) I will give it straight from my vein

I'm feeling my pain
Do you feel where it's been
Can you strip with mystery of the world,
I'll let it suffer for its blind
'Till the shape of the shadow fades
forever fade away

I'm calling you, dear.
Can't you see me standing right here?
Life's bleeding from fear.
I'll give it straight from my vein.

(In the rain) I'm calling you, dear
(Find the way) Can't you see me standing right here?
(Feel my pain) Life's bleeding from fear
(Find its place) I will give it straight from my vein
