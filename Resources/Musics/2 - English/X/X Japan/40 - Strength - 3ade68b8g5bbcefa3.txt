STRENGTH

In a dream world sad
Without some love
Unable even finished my own life
What should I do?

Loving, I lost everything
But I still try
The beauty of protecting someone
This was just an illusion

Without even being able to protect
His strength and goodness, there's only pain
If everyone is carrying
Unable to set their own destiny
Please tell me

I can not even meet
The promises I made that day
I thought somehow
I'm just a happy little

No matter how difficult the past was
Or if you lost
I can see a little light
I am sure that is not an illusion

If your strength and goodness
I just might protect my true feelings
People's hearts are changing things
I want to try to believe that I can live like this until tomorrow
Please do not cry anymore because I'm here

Even though I'm looking forward to the future
Even if our hearts are lost
Because people's hearts can change
I will not miss the people I love

If your strength and goodness
Because people's hearts can change

Living without losing more
Now, do not cry anymore, and start walking
