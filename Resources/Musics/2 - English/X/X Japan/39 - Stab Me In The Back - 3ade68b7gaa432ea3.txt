STAB ME IN THE BACK

I'm having sex
Wishing for six
I'm having sex
Touch me, Make me feel

Knock me out Marry
Get me off Jane
Knock me off Marry
Pet me violently

Can't you give me more to the last
I can't get enough Take me down

I'm on Junk
I'm getting high
I'm on Junk
Let me go mad

Kiss me off, vamp
Get away, tramp
Kiss me off, vamp
Leave me, Why don't you

Can't you give me more ? Do or Die
I can't be satisfied

I can't take this life
Stab me in the back
I can't take my life
Stab me in the back

Wipe out my life "Bask in blood"
Dripping from your heart
Destroy this world "Drive me Mad"
Don't need nothing in my life

Wipe out my life "Bask in blood"
Driping from your heart
Destroy this world "Drive my mad"
O.D. on sex

I'm having sex
Wishing for six
I'm having sex
Touch me, Make me feel

Can't you give me more ? Do or Die
I can't be satisfied

Wipe out my life 'Bask in blood"
Dripping from your heart
Destroy this world 'Drive me Mad"
Don't need nothing in my life

Stab me in the back
