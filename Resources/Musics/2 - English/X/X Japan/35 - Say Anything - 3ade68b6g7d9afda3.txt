SAY ANYTHING

Sawameki dake ga kokoro o sashite kikoenai mune no toiki
toki o wasurete motome samayou takanaru omoi nurashite
Run away from reality I've been crying in the dream
Kôritsuita toki ni furuete
yugande mienai kioku kasaneru kanashimi ga kieru made

* You say anything kizutsuke au kotoba demo
Say anything tachikirenai kokoro ni
You say anything Just tell me all your sweet lies
Say anything enji kirenai kokoro ni

If I can't go back to where I have been
yume no naka ni dake ikite owaranai ame ni nureru
nagareru namida o hakujitsuyume ni somete

You say anything Whatever you like to say to me
Say anything you Leave me out of my eyes
You say anything All I can hear is voice from dream
Say anything You can dry my every tear

Akari no kieta On the stage hitori mitsumete
Tôritsugita hibi ni dakareru
Kowashite kure nani mo ka mo kazatta ai mo
Toki no suna ni kieru made - 

Repeat *


Close your eyes and - I'll kill you in the rain
Kirei ni koroshi aeba zoka no bara ni umoreta
Shijin no namida wa kioku ni nagasarete

Time may change my life 
But my heart remains the same to you
Time may change your heart 
My love for you never changes

You say anything kitzutsuke au kotoba demo
Say anything tachikirenai kokoro ni

You say anything, - say anything
Now you've gone away Where can I go from here?
Say anything, - say anything......

"I believed if time passes, everything turns into beauty.
If the rain stop, tears clean the scars of memory away.
Everything starts wearing fresh colors.
Every sound begins playing a heartful melody.
Jealousy embellishes a page of epic.
Desire is embraced in a dream
But my mind is still in chaos and....."
