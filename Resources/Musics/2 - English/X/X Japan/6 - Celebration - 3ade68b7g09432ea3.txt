CELEBRATION

(SO TIRED)
norari kurari no CHEAP TIME
I'M NEVER SATISFIED
gozen sanji no TV SHOW
sagesumu kuchibiru kara wa SEX APPEAL

(BITCH)
mikakedaoshi no HYPER LADY
I'M NEVER SATISFIED
tatta gofun no CELEBRATION
kinyou no asa made nya kieusero!

mayonakasugi no CINDERELLA yo...
GLASS no kutsu wa mou iranai

ELITE kidori no PINOCCHIO no hana wa
orete hia ni naru

MANEQUIN domo no BABBLE wa 9 to 5

NEW YORK kara ore no heya made

* HEY! CELEBRATION!
RING A BELL!! SWING YOUR HEART! SING A SONG!
HEY! CELEBRATION!
THROW AWAY! SAIL AWAY SHOUT IT OUT! SHOW IT OUT!

COME ON! CELEBRATION!
murasaki no SMOKE AND ILLUSION
STAND UP! REVOLUTION
LIMOUSINE ni hi wo tsukero

when the clock struck at midnight
the coach turned into a pumpkin and
the dress became a rug!
and only a glass slipper was left behind
suddenly Cinderella crushed it and
she kicked her fuckin' onld stepmother out
and, she started for the real celebration
that would start very soon

SUPANKOORU no tsuki ga warau machi
FINAL no koe wa todokanai

[* repeat]

COME ON! CELEBRATION!

CHEERS! CONGRATULATIONS!
sekaijuu ni LET IT FALL
