ORGASM (INGLÃŠS)

Shivering trembling from the thought of facing tomorrow
Ice cold heart is a wall standing in my way
Desperate and thirsty with the desire for
The action and passion of the life you live
Garments of lies disguising yourself
will drag you down never reach out for the sky

Strapped and bound down to the ground by vanity
Rushing in me there's the blood screaming to be free
The pleasure of mind that is strapped in the chains
is always on guard for your words to me

Dancing in a land without any hope
Is no way to break the cage of time

Get to orgasm Get to orgasm
Let your body free
Get to orgasm Get to orgasm
Try to get your dream
