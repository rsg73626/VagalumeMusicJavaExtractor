ROSE OF PAIN

WHY ARE YOU SCARED?
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN?
IN THE CASTLE WITH THE SILENT ROSES
I ASK AGAIN AND AGAIN
WHY ARE YOU SAD?
WHAT PAIN ARE YOU FEELING?
OH, I ASK OF THE ROSE WITH ITS PETALS OF BLOOD
BUT THE ROSE OF BLOOD CAN'T ANSWER ME TILL THE END

SCREAM WITHOUT RAISING YOUR VOICE
iki wo koroshite mitsumeru

kuroi hitomi no oku shinpi ni michita hohoemi wo ukaberu
himei to tomo ni nagareru kurushimi wo mitsumete
shiroi suhada ni shinju no kubikazari wo yosoui
kyouki no chi to tawamure, odori hajimeru
ai wo nakushita kokoro, satsuriku no yorokobi ni moeru
SHE WILL KILL TO MAKE HERSELF MORE BEAUTIFUL
gisei wo houseki ni kaete mo

gisei no subete wo, iki wo koroshite mitsumeru

SLICE THEM! SLICE THEM TILL THEY'RE RUNNING IN BLOOD
nigemawaru onna wo
TEAR UP! TEAR UP TILL THEIR RED BLOOD RUNS DRY
hadaka no karada wo tsurushiagete

nikushimi ni koroshi au, toki no nagare no naka de
chi de arau, karada no kagayaki motomete
yokubou ni dakareta kokoro iki ba wo miushinai
ai no subete wo hikisaku, namida sae misezu ni
ROSE OF PAIN subete wo
mitsume obieru

Rose of Pain
the castle became a violent sea of blood
the blood covers the flower, dying it deep red
stop! stop dying me red
I can't take anymore
you are too cruel!
stop! please stop!

SLICE THEM! SLICE THEM TILL THEY'RE RUNNING IN BLOOD
nigemawaru onna wo
CLOSE UP! CLOSE UP THEIR MOUTH USING THREAD AND NEEDLE
hadaka no karada wo tsurushiagete

* motome ai kizutsuku ai wo azakeri warai
kawaita karada no uruoi motomete
KILL THEM ALL chimamire no kokoro subete wo miushinai
ikiru zangyaku no naka de, namida sae misezu ni

[* repeat]

ROSE OF PAIN I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ROSE OF PAIN kurushii
ROSE OF PAIN

IN ETERNAL MADNESS WE LIVE
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST A DREAM
NOW PAIN, NOTHING BUT PAIN!
ROSE OF PAIN!
