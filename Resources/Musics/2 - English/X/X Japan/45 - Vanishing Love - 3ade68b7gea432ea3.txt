VANISHING LOVE

I'M BORED TO DEATH (GO MAD)
kabe ni tobi-chiru SPRINTER OF GLASS (SHED BLOOD)
kaerimiru kako ni mushibamare chi wo nagasu

I COME TO MY SENSE (AT LAST)
azakeri-warai OUTSIDER
subete kudake-chiru kaikan ni me wo samasu

kioku ni yaki-tsuku omae no
sugata chi HEAD de haki-sutero
I DON'T WANNA VASHINING LOVE

BREAK OUT OF (MY MOLD)
kagami ni utsuru FALSE FACE (BREAK UP)
mi-ushinai-kaketa yokubou wo baku-kesu toki

MAKE A PAST (AT GIRL)
maboroshi ni mita A REAL KNOCK OUT
kichigai-jimita kairaku ni ake-kurero

* karami-tsuku omae no genei wasurarenai kurushimi
chi-mayou kokoro no kakera wa kage mo katachi mo nai yume wo
ima mo oi-tsuzuiteru tsukurareta kyouki-yosooi

"I CAN'T STAND"
HOW I TRY TO DECEIVE MYSELF HOW
"WAITING FOR YOU"
IF TEAR TURN IN TO BLOOD
"CAN'T GET AWAY"
HOW I TRY TO DECIVE MYSELF
"PORTRAIT OF YOU"
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
I CAN'T LOSE TRACK OF YOU I MISSEDcan't lose track of you I missed

# INJURY DEEP INSIDE MY HEART STILL REMAIN
CUT UP MY HEART, YOU LIVE
IN MY ILLUSION YOU GO AWAY
I STAND ROOTED TO THE SPOT [2X]

[# repeat]

[# repeat]

(LAUGH AT ME) BEING AT MY WIT'S END
(LAUGH AT ME) EVEN IF IT'S A FORCED SMILE
(LAUGH AT ME) BEING AT MY WIT'S END
