UNFINISHED

Oh! I'm looking at you
can't control myself
nothing, but pain for me

* wipe your tears from your eyes
just leave and forget me
no need to be hurt anymore

# go away from me now
I don't know what is love?
no need to be hurt anymore

you said, "I miss you so much
everynight thinking of you
and facing loneliness"

?But when you feel sadness
never can I stay with you

I'm not the one you need
close your eyes and forget me
there's nothing I can do anymore

I lost my way

I've been walking in the night of tears
there I found someone was holding you
as the night was falling down
with my love also vanished my vision of you

my heart is cold now

[* repeat]

you said, "I need you always
everyday thinking of you
and living loneliness"

[?repeat]

[# repeat]

can't find my way
