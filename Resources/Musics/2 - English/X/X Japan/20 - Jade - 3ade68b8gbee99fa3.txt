JADE

Walk through the light to find the shadow
Til' your gods stall you from the edge,
Sunk in the thought, the feel, the distance,
Was it your secret?

Stop holding your fear,
Let memory live and die alone
No need to be there,
Let oyur desire scream, 'till you feel alive

‘Cause you are beautiful, your scars are beautiful, Like the jade
You'll still shine, when you sink into the sea
When all the bleeding scarlet jealousy carves the way you believe.

Brink og the light, the wings of the night, look into the eyes of fallen angels
Sink like a stone into the dark where no light can touch
Will God break my fall?
I feel the mystery, tries to take me along,
To the end of the world,
Where I still believe,
The color is from your eyes.

‘Cause you are beautiful
Your blood was beautiful, yesterday
I still hide, at the seam of memories
Oh I still hold my rosary beneath the pain of life
Where the tears, when the bloody face of love, they take away  the stain,
Know that the stars of the sky
Glow in the ocean,
The art of life,
Makes me wanna die in the colour of heaven

Ah, another day has come, another friend has gone into the flame
It's burning now
Jibun de kirisai ta mune no kizuato sae birei ni naru made

‘Cause you are beautiful, your scars are beautiful like the jade
You'll still shine, when you sink into the sea
When the bleeding scarlet jealously carves the way you believe,
Now and forever, You'll be loved, Let your destin lead your heart
My Jade
