BREAK THE DARKNESS

Break the darkness!

Howling wolf prowling around in the broken city 
His gray crows want victim for own desire 
People who lost their dream passing by him 
The tusk of him hunger for blood is ready to strike 

Voice saund under the ground 
Is there chuckle of the gods! 

Howling wolf prowling around in the broken city 
He don't afraid the death of him that may come tommorow 
People who lost their dream passing by him 
When his eyes shine at the victim he attack to them 

(Chorus)
Fire grow up from the ground 
Is there chuckle of the gods
Is there tears of the gods (hey!) 
No more tears! No more tears!

(Chorus)

Fire grow up from the ground 
Break! Break! No more this legend 
Break! Break! No more this town
