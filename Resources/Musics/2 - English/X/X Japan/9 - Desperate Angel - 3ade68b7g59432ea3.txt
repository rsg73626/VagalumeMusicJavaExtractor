DESPERATE ANGEL

Desperate Angel
Fallin' from the sky

Desperate Angel
Now you wonder why

In a shitty town Lotta scum around
Born into the world of make believe

What you feel No way it's real
Everybody plays the game

Wanting more than you had before
Never gonna be satisfied

Where to go You don't know
How is your material world?

* (So won't you come beside me)
Now you're gonna get it
(Because you know I'll set you free)
Rock you all night

Does it feel right?
I am letting go now yeah!

(Well they) sell me this
and they sell me that
Don't want none of your fuckin' crap

(Got a) lot to say
do it my own way
I will never follow

Cannot change
Rearrange
I don't care no matter what you say

Pay your dues win or lose
How is your material world?

(I'm burning, got the fire)
I am gonna take you
(You see you're my hot desire)
Show me your stuff

Ready? Go!
Give you what you want and more!

Desperate Angel
Got no wings to fly

Desperate Angel
Sadness in your eye

I wanna feel what's inside of you
I want you so bad

Forget what you've seen
And forget what you know right away

I wanna feel what's inside of you
I want you so bad

I'll show you the way
Then we'll sail far away
Paradise through the night No!

*

(Burning up! Look out!)

Desperate Angel
Fallin' from the sky

Desperate Angel
Now you wonder why

Desperate Angel You got a bad time
'nother lost soul

Desperate Angel
Got no wings to fly

Desperate Angel
Fallin' from the sky

Desperate Angel
Love you can not buy
