HERO

I was such a mess
The other day
I hurt myself to see
Oh... If you care
If you believe
Like cracks in the mirror

Oh, I slit my skin
'Til I, I felt something real
Cause I was losing
Losing my reflection
There's a hero
In you
Inside of you
Oh, who'll resolve the doubt
But I'm asking why I'm still here
Standing in the rain

Did I fail you dear
Like painless suicide
You buried the creed
Beneath blood-red roses
Had life... Life had just begun
I knew nothing could stay the same
But feeling, can feeling last
Forever?

There's a hero
In you
Inside of you
Oh, who'll resolve the down
But I'm asking why I'm still here
Standing in the rain
They said there's a hero
In you, who'd flied with fears
Who could set you free
From death
From the world
In a world you've been left alone

There's a hero
In you
Inside of you
Oh, who'll resolve the doubt
But I'm asking why I'm still here
All by myself
Feeling the touch of red
From my skin
