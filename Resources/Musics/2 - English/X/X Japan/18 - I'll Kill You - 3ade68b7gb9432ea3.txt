I'LL KILL YOU

It's all over with me now
and I'll kill you
you changed me
you drove me mad
you robbed me of my loving, it's you!

still I'm sad that you betrayed me
it's all over with me now
all over with me now
and I'll kill you!

* don't let me go unchecked
I've gotta go wild [x2]

don't call it dream or fantasy
nobody knows my soul burned as fire
why my heart was broken so heavy
you might know my love was for you
you know!

oh! go to the grave together

[* repeat]

I'll kill you (You go to the grave with me)
I'll kill you
