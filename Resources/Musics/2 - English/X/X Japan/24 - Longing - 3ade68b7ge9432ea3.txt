LONGING

kizutsuke atta kotoba mo
kasaneta namida mo
itsuka wa omoide ni naru yo
dakara...togireta Melody
mune ni dakishimete ashita mo ikiru daro
anata ni aenakute mo

Sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you feel my heart
Falling through the rain

I'll sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you hold my tears
Cause, still I love you

I can't face the thought of being alone
I sing for the song still carries on
mune ni dakishimete omoi wo utawasete
koe ni naranakute mo

Sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you feel my pain
There's nothing I can do

I still have a longing for your memory
kizutsuku dake demo
kokoro wo tsutaetai yo

ima wa...hitori ni shinai de
furisosogu ame ni koware sona yume
ashita wo kanaderu kara

Sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you feel my heart
Falling through the rain

I'll sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you hold my tears
Cause, Still I love you

I'll sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you feel my heart
Falling through the rain

I'll sing without you
I'll sing without you
Can't you hold my tears
Cause, Still I love you
