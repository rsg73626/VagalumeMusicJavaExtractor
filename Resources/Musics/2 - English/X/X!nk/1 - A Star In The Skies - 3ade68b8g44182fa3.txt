A STAR IN THE SKIES

The emptiness dominates the horizon
The horizon's obscure west
The black night dresses it
It's a bathing with the silence of my sadness

Gloria de Domino
Domino Shatanas
Gloria de Domino
Domino Inferni

The apparition of malignant spirits
Reflects the shadow of a brilliant moonlight
Your light dresses it
It's a bathing with the magic of my eyes

The apparition of an malignant blaze
A star in the skies kisses my immortal soul

A Star in the Skies
