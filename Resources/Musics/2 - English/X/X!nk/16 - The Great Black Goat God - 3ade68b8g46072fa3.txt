THE GREAT BLACK GOAT GOD

The majestic black goat
Seated in your gold throne
Arise of the asleep ashes,
Blown by the north's winds
Sadogoat!!!
Oh Belzebuth, rise of the cosmo's immensity!!!
Your majesty is the king of the emptiness,
Point us the precious scepter
Of your beautiful left hand
Blow your stormy sand
In our shameful faces
Oh, great God of the Flies,
Flap your beautiful wings
Magnificently in our direction, because we waited anxious for you,
Oh Monarch of All Gods, we hoped you remember this splendor
Hear our prayers and protect us eternally, take a bath with your fires and
furious howls, Oh Baphometic Beast!!!
