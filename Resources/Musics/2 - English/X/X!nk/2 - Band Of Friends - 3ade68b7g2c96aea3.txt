BAND OF FRIENDS

It began when I was still an infant 
Two good friends, in the same class 
They were soul mates, side by side 
And then I joined them 

Hey hey 

He moved away, the friendship seemed lost 
Then he became the chosen one 
They began to play together, it clicked 
And the drummer drummed 

(chorus)

A band is a bond that never breaks 
Not even by accident 
You see, they have each other 
Together they always manage 

Hey hey 

They met again at a party 
Then the band was reunited 
He walked over to him, he had a guitar 
He was a drummer, no doubt about it 

Hey 

The band and the bond both grew and grew 
Perpetual motion, no motor needed 
It never broke down, it just kept on going 
It never came to an end 

(chorus)

The band and the bond both grew and grew 
Perpetual motion, no motor needed 
It never broke down, it just kept on going 
It never came to an end 

Hey hey hey
