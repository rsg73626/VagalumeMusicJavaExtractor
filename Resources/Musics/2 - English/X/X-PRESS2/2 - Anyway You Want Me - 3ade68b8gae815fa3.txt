ANYWAY YOU WANT ME

Take Me Anyway You Want Me
'cause I Need Your Love to See Me Through
You Can Make Me Anyway You Want Me
That's All That I Can Offer You
I Have Tried So Hard to Please You
But I Just Can't Seem to Reach You

Tried, Tried a Little Kindness
Every Night and Day Like I Knew I Should
But You Can Take Me, Yes and You Can Leave Me
But I Always Stayed, and You Knew I Would
Come On, Come On Closer Now
I Will Get to You Somehow

Come On, Come On Closer Now
I Will Get to You Somehow
But You Got to Show Me How
Please, Please Baby, Please
Please, Baby Show Me the Way to Your Heart

You Got to Take Me Anyway You Want Me
Or Take Me Just, Just the Way I Am
Take Me, Or You Can Make Me
