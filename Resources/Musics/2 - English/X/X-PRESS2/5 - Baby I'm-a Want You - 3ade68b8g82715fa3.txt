BABY I'M-A WANT YOU

Baby, i'm-a want you
Baby, i'm-a need you
You the only one i care enough to hurt about
Maybe i'm-a crazy
But i just can't live without...

Your lovin' and affection
Givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour
Lately i'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why...

Lately i'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh
And made me cry...
You taught me why...

Baby, i'm-a want you
Baby, i'm-a need you

Oh, it took so long to find you, baby

Baby, i'm-a want you
Baby, i'm-a need you
