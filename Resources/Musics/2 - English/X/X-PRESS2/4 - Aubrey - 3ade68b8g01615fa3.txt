AUBREY

And Aubrey was her name,
A not so very ordinary girl or name.
But who's to blame?
For a love that wouldn't bloom
For the hearts that never played in tune.
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing,
Take away the words that rhyme it doesn't mean a thing.

And aubrey was her name.
We triped the light and danced together to the moon,
But where was june.
No it never came around.
If it did it never made a sound,
Maybe i was absent or was listening to fast,
Catching all the words, but then the meaning going past,

But god i miss the girl,
And i'd go a thousand times around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me.

And aubrey was her name,
I never knew her, but i loved her just the same,
I loved her name.
Wish that i had found the way
And the reasons that would make her stay.
I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest.
If i can't have the one i want, i'll do without the best.

But how i miss the girl
And i'd go a million times around the world just to say
She had been mine for a day.
