ANN

Ann A-sleepin' On My Bed
Hair A-tumblin'' Round Your Head
You Will Always Be Apart of Me
When I Look in Your Eyes... It's My Reflection I See

Ann I Wonder How You Knew
I Needed Someone Just Like You
Were You On a Beam of Guiding Light
That Came in My Life... Late That September Night.

And Though I Try to Hold Back the Years
I Cannot Hold the Dawn
And So I Try to Hold Back the Tears
When Love Has Grown Up and Gone...

Ann I'll Love You 'till I Die
And When You Hear This Lullabye
I'll Be With You Though We're Far Apart
And You'll Be With Me... Right Here Inside My Heart.
