THE HIDDEN MASK OF EXISTENCE

Modern world, civilized man
Hidden truths, senseless rules
Who are you? what's in your mind?
Behind the mask a mocking smile

Society castrates you, restrains your instincts 
Your anger is channeled to the war
You keep trying to find out what you really are
Your identity is lost in the crowd

[Bridge]
It's your life: no return
Raised in this womb of lies
Taught to love what you should hate
To fear the truth that you should know

[Chorus]
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Make this world your own
Fight!

New millenium schizoid man
Buying shit you don't need
They try to sell you a brand new life
Of fame and fortune if you wish

Riot, mayhem you bring instead
To kill the super ego industry
To just be the thorn on the authorities' back
Denying to follow the weak

[Bridge]
A state of chaos you devise
Deprived of your hope for life
Terror is just a desperate cry
To stupefy the world

[Chorus]
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Make this world your own
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Awake the self and show
The Hidden Mask Of Existence!

(Lead - Luciana)

self-improvement is self-abuse
self-destruction the path
Congratulations friend'o mine
Get ready to hit the ground

[Chorus]
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Make this world your own
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Awake the self and show
The Hidden Mask Of Existence!

You are not an unique snowflake.  
You are not part of the masterplan
Stand Up!

You're organic matter you'll decay
You are not yourself, nothing else
Rise!

[Chorus]
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Make this world your own
Fight! 
Now you're done!
Awake the self and show
The Hidden Mask Of Existence!
