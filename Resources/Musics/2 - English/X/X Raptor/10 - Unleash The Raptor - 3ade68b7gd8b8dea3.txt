UNLEASH THE RAPTOR

Instincts aroused, breeding life
Setting you free from prison - prison of thoughts!
Rampage feelings, riot intents
Breaking down the walls - high walls of gold!

[Bridge]
Earth is not our property
Pretentious monkeys' insanity
All mankind has lost its pace
In search for a foolish paradise

[Chorus]
Unleash The Raptor
Injustice predator
The X Raptor
Iniquity hunter
Unleash the raptor!

Feel the cold on your spine
Adrenaline running wild
Relentless you will fight
Restless you will rise!

(Lead - Sant`Ana)

Nature strength, Gaia's brood  
Denying mass submission - submission of will!
Animal within, rebel inside
Seeds on barren soil - old soil where we were born! 

(Bridge)
(Pre-chorus)
(Chorus)
