SIMULACRA SIMULATION

(Lead - Sant`Ana)

Welcome to the "real" world
Load your life from the system
Domination by the code
Cold life, bare existence

Your dreams on the TV screen
They know what you think
Through technical fantasy
Enter hyperreality!

[Bridge 1]
Far beyond the true
Yet beyond the false
Life seems like frozen time

Fight now the oppressor!

Inside there is a meaning we can't see
They try to wipe it away

Simulacra Simulation

[Chorus]
I can see them now
Controlling your mind
Hyperreality
Cloning of the weak

No will to live, yet none to die
Masses submission
Real an allegory of death
(Hyperreal) endless resurrection

Clear and clean, sterilized
No blood, flesh and bones
Self of self, xerox man
That's what you've become

[Bridge 2]
Simulating new thoughts
Exterminating sense
Of life now operational

Fight now the oppressor!

Inside there is a meaning we can't see
They try to wipe it away

Simulacra Simulation

(Chorus)

(Lead - Garavello)

Do they control what I am feeling
Could life regenerate my burning scars?
Do they control what I am dreaming
Could death cease the pain that numbs my mind?
I finally understand: I'm one of them! 

(Lead - Sant`Ana)

(Bridge 1)
(Chorus)

I can see them now
Controlling your mind
Hyperreality
Artificial ecstasy
I can see'Em now
Controlling your mind
Hyperreality
Turns you into a battery

What's reality?
What if there's no reality?
