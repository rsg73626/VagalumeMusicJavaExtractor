BURNING HATE

Chaos time
The inferno is here
A place of false old values
A no man's land

Civilization
Equals enslaved mankind
The Media drugs society
Brainwashes minds

In the silence
Fading painful cries
Starving children suffer and die
On TV just lies!

Lives in gray
That's our epitaph
But We're not dead but only asleep!
Asleep by their control

[Brigde]
We don't need no "war against terror"
Claiming to save mankind
We do need a revolution now
For human rights

[Chorus]
Burning Hate
It's all I feel
When I see
Misery, ignorance...
And a motherfuckin' war!

Take your time
Realize you're not alone
Don't be a pawn in this power's chess
Of a supposed "Democracy"

Scream out loud!!
Against man's retrogression
"War-Spangled Banner" is standing ground
As the East in silence falls 

[Brigge]
We don't need no "war against terror" 
Claiming to save mankind
We do need a revolution now
For the human rights

[Chorus]
Burning Hate
It's all I feel
When I see
Misery, hypocrisy...
And a motherfuckin' war!

(Lead - Daniel)

Burning Hate
It's all I feel
When I see
Misery, petty politics...
Burning Hate
It's all I feel
When I see
Misery, petty politics...
And another motherfuckin' war!!!
