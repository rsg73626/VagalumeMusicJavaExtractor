CORTEX DISCONNECTION

Final visualization
Failing nervous signals
Petrified eyes in silence
My memories were deleted

[Bridge]
Darkish veil around me, a vortex of countless images in circles
Why has it all to come to this bitter end?
The pain for the loss of trivial things,
My brain, my face, my eyes eaten by worms

This is not fair!!! 
Oh, no!!!!

[Chorus]
Backtrack
To avoid
Cortex Disconnection (2x)

Life experiences down to the drain
The All becomes Nothingness
A morbid sensation of limbo
(And) the lack of ash gray kiss of death

(Bridge)
(Chorus) (2x)
(Lead - Sant`Ana)
(Chorus)  (2x)
