MY CREW

We are family
We fight for us
We respect this
We Consider this
Don't enought be straight edge
To be one for us

Your need to be true
It's not your shit band
Or how many shows IT HAD DO
that will make you be one of us

We are few, but strong
I never needed and don't need you
I prefer be to belive
And don't to creat ANY IMAGE
Just the true
just strong
THIS IS MY CREW.
