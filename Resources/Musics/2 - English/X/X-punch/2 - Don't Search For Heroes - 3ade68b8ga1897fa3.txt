DON'T SEARCH FOR HEROES

Don't live in the lie
Don't believe in heroes
Search for your strength
And never give up

Set your aims
Choose your path
Conquest for you
And don't seek heroes anymore

DON'T SEARCH FOR... fucking heroes

Do the best you can
Don't use crutch
Use your own Legs
To overcome your challenges

DON'T SEARCH FOR... fuckin'

Let's go, the time is now
My mind is clean
And ready to fight.
