BE TRUE

You have the choice in your hands
you choose the path of lies
You didn't want to be true
To yourself
Instead of facing your problems
You choose hiding
Another dring, another swig
Choose how to fool yourself

STRAIGHT EDGE is strenght
STRAIGHT EDGE is believe
Be strong and believe in yourself

AND BE TRUE, don't delude yourself
Drugs just make you to decay
Positive youth until the death
