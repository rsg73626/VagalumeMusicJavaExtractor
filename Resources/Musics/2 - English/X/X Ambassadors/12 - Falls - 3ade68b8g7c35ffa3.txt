FALLS

Held on to your letters
They're getting better with age
Now my desk's like a pulpit
And my bed like a stage
See all these debts keep me under
Ain't no words worth the cost
If I should carry me farther
The load of a lover once lost

We used to walk down the road
To buttermilk falls
Dips in your feet put your hair down
Thinkin I just won't make it
And if I go back tomorrow will I
Still feel the same
I put my feet in the water but the water got hotter so I just
Keep my body by the edge of the bay

Make believe we were younger
Forget the money we owe
But you got your prior commitments baby
Just wish I had some of my own
Cuz ain't no loving me
Before you know what I'm worth
You were the life of the party
And I am the scum of the earth

But we used to walk down the road
To buttermilk falls
Dips in your feet put your hair down
Thinkin I just won't make it
And if I go back tomorrow will I
Still feel the same
I put my feet in the water but the water got hotter so I just
Keep my body by the edge of the bay
