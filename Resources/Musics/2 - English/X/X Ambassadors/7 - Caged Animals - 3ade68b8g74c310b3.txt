CAGED ANIMALS

Why'd you run away from me?
I swear I'll never understand
Your eyes all full of the hopes a dreams of another
Yet I stand on all fours

Like a dog, in the back of the cage
I could stall, be your ball and chain

Won't you keep me company?
You know I wanted it too
Stuck in a rut, the color of vomit in a bucket
And everyday I need you more and more and more

Like a dog, in the back of the cage
I could stall, be your ball and chain
Like a dog, in the back of the cage
I could stall, be your ball and chain
