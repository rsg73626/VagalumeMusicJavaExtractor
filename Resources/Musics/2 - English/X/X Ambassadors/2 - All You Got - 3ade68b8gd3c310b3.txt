ALL YOU GOT

Lights out
Hit by the full moon
I can't do this
Alone
Maybe
If we can keep running
Someone will come and guide us home
But is that
Is that
Is that all you got?

Burn down
Cut down the redwoods
Take all the dead ones one by one
Don't speak
Somewhere someone is listening
There's no cease and desisting ?till it's done

But is that
Is that
Is that all you?
Is that
Is that
Is that all you got
