COLLIDER

Move your hands in slow motion
Slow motion, slow motion, slow motion for me
Feel the devil's approaching
Approaching, approaching, approaching me
Move your head in slow motion
Slow motion, slow motion, slow motion for me
Two objects collide
No one will survive

Collide
Collide
Collide
Collide

[tom morello]
Feel the burst, it keeps haunting me
Haunting me, haunting me, haunting me
Come in close, it holds onto me
Onto me, onto me, onto me

But I turn my grave, you could long to me
Long to me, long to me, long to me
As we look in your eyes
You don't have long to survive

[tom morello]
Collide
Collide
Collide
Collide
