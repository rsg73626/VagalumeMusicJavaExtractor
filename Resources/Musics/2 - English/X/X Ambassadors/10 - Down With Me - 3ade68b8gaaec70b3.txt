DOWN WITH ME

Throw it right back just to put me right down
It'll put me right back where I'll never be found
Better drink it all down
Better drink it all down
Keep me in sight when you turn out the lights
When you open your eyes I'll be laying on the ground
Never making a sound
Baby you can still get down

Get down with me
You down with me
Flopping on the floor like a fish out a water
Get down with me
Get down with me
Blowing all my money before I even get it
Are you down with me
See behind the doors I'm locking
Drinks keep dropping you still
Get down with me
Down with me
Get down with me

Ice cream cone with a cherry on top
With her cherry un-popped so I guess I gotta leave her alone
Yeah, I'm gonna leave her alone
Meet me outside with the doors wide open
The door's wide open, but this one
I'll leave her alone too
Who am I going home too?

Get down with
Get down with me
Flopping on the floor like a fish out of water
Get down with me
Get down with me
Blowing all my money before I even get it
Are you down with me
See behind the doors I'm locking
Drinks keep dropping
Still get down with me
Get down with me
Get down with me

Breaking down the doors I'm locking
Drinks keep dropping
Pills keep popping
Cups keep knocking
Oh, oh
And on and on
On and on
On and on
