RENEGADES

Run away with me
Lost souls in revelry
Running wild and running free
Two kids, you and me

And I say, hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades
Renegades

Long live the pioneer
Rebels and mutineers
Go forth and have no fear
Come close and lend an ear

And I say, hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades
Renegades

All hail the underdogs
All hail the new kids
All hail the outlaws
Spielbergs and Kubricks
It's our time to make a move
It's our time to make amends
It's our time to break the rules
Let's begin

And I say, hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades
Renegades
