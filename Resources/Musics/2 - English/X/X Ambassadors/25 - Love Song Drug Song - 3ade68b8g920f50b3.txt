LOVE SONG DRUG SONG

Alright
Stay over
Stinking like jackie-d and coca-cola
Hey now
Don't try to fuck with me

Ill throw you underneath
The bus if you understand me
Love songs
Drug songs
We can get together
If you get to know me
Play nice
Baby think twice

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together

Play dead, roll over
Stinking like sex in a range rover
Bail out, baby you asked for it
Pray that someone in the car got the cash for it
Love songs, are drug songs
We can get together if you understand me
Blink twice
Baby think twice

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together

Grown man, tipping over
Stinking like a badge and a filled quota
Hard time
Break you out again
Break you out
Break you out again
Break you out

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
