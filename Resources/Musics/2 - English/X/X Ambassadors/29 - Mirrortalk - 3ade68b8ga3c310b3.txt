MIRRORTALK

And when the damage is done
We'll all be on top of eachother
We'll take all our belongings
Make a fire, sleeping over the covers

Oh me! Such a pity, such a pity
That I couldn't remember
With all the money I spent on you
I should've bought me another
Make a sale,
make somebody with a habit love you
Take all your winnings
Take it back to the beginning again

Somebody got a problem with the way I talk
Then forgive me
It's not the drugs, it's everybody else in the room

Somebody close the door
Too many people in my house again
Don't wanna go to the party no more
I want to dance alone in the mirror

Somebody shut my eyes
I got my vices in a vise again
Sleepwalking in perfect time
Seven, eight, nine Ohh ohh

And when the children are sleeping
We'll lock them all up in the cupboards
I think I ran outta juice, I think
We left it on the floor in a rubber
Never decided what I wanted to do with my time
I'm still a baby, still left all alone in the womb

Somebody close the door
Too many people in my house again
Don't wanna go to the party no more
I want to dance alone in the mirror

Somebody shut my eyes
I got my vices in a vise again
Sleepwalking in perfect time
Seven, eight, nine ohh oo-ooo
