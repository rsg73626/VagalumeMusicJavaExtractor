FEAR (FEAT. IMAGINE DRAGONS)

(Sam Harris)
There's a whisper, a rumor
Voices in the air outside
Got their eyes on the future
Yeah, the kids are coming up on the ride

God, I'm running in fear, fear, fear
God, I'm running in fear, fear, fear

(Dan Reynolds)
Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that
Moo-oo-oo-ves
Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that
Moo-oo-oo-ves

(Sam Harris)
Roll this cup of deuces
The fuel will keep the fire alive
All the police think we're useless
Yeah, the kids are coming out tonight

God, I'm running in fear, fear, fear
God, I'm running in fear, fear, fear

(Dan Reynolds)
Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that

I'm 'fraid of everything that
Moo-oo-oo-ves
