B.I.G

[Verse 1]
I been working night and day
I'm going berserk and I'm going insane
But I say "hey, it's a new day"
"Hey, I'm on my way"
I wouldn't stay, but if you made me
Bring on the next phase

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go big
I feel bigger than ever before
I'm gonna go big
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before
And you can tell your friends and all their friends
I want the whole wide world to know
I'm gonna go big
B. I. G., bigger than I was before

[Verse 2]
So come on, watch me
Stay up late
Come on, everybody
We got to congregate
We say "hey, it's a new day"
"Hey, I'm on my way"
I wouldn't stay, but if you made me
Bring on the next phase

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go big
I feel bigger than ever before
I'm gonna go big
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before
And you can tell your friends and all their friends
I want the whole wide world to know
I'm gonna go big
B. I. G., bigger than I was before

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go big
I feel bigger than ever before
I'm gonna go big
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before
And you can tell your friends and all their friends
I want the whole wide world to know
I'm gonna go big
B. I. G., bigger than I was before

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go big
I feel bigger than ever before
I'm gonna go big
Yeah, I'm going bigger than I was before
And you can tell your friends and all their friends
I want the whole wide world to know
I'm gonna go big
B. I. G., bigger than I was before
