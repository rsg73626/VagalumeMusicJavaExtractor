BODYBAG

Lead me o'er my time has come
The seed is sown and the war is won
Leave me my dignity but
Promise you'll be patient with me
Cuz I have been so lonely I could die

Lead me down where my audience lies
Strip me of everything I've worn in my disguise
Adorn me in beggar's rags but
Don't take off their shopping tags
My millions paid could save one million more
