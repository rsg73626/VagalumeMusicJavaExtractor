LOVE SONGS DRUG SONGS

Alright, stay over
Stinking like jackie-d and coca cola
Hey now, don't try to fuck with me
Throw you underneath the bus if you understand
Love songs, drug songs
We can get together if you think you know
Play nice
Baby think twice

And I looked you in the eye
You know, this is the last time I
Am gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I
Am gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together

Play dead, roll over
Stinking like sex in a range rover
Bail out? Baby you asked for it
Pray that someone in the car got the cash for it
Love songs, drug songs
We can get together if you understand
Blink twice
Baby think twice

And I looked you in the eye
You know, this is the last time I
Am gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
And I looked you in the eye
You know this is the last time I
Am gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together

Grown man, tipping over
Stinking like a badge and a filled quota
Hard time
Break you out again
Break you out
Break you out again
Break you out

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I looked you in the eye
You know this is the last time I
Am gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
And I looked you in the eye
You know this is the last time I
Am gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together

I'm gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
I'm gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
