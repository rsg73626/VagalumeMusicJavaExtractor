LAY ME DOWN

Lay me down under foreign stars
Stoking the coals in the fire
I've run so far, they're still
So hot on my heels

And I'll be the last man alive
Let me sleep for a hundred years
All these memories and patterns 
they twist and they turn in the dark
I came here to talk won't you
Remember me lovely

But nothing is the same anymore
Rip van winkle abandon your family
Slip away from your sons and your daughters
Rest your white weary head neath these willow trees

Let your beard grow as long as your father's
Nine to five at the p&c
A life in the factory or the mines
My hands they shake

Can't get it up like I used to
And I'll be the last to survive
All that you said don't mean shit to me

All that you said is a lie
My hands they shake
Can't get it up like I used to
And I'll be the last of my kind
