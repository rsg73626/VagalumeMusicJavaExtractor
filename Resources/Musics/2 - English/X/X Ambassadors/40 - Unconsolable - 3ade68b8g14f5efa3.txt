UNCONSOLABLE

I hope we stay 
Thick as thieves, butter and bread 
Pillars of colonial homes 
And I wish I could shout you out 
False start 
Don't get your cane caught in the cracks 
Buckle your seatbelts, polluting the airwaves 
Single and lonely 

And you said you are 
Unconsolable 
And you said you are 
And you said you are 
Unconsolable 
Uncontrollable 

Come up to my house 
Drink with my friends 
You can lay on my couch 
Achin to start all over again 
Going back to your room 
But wait a minute its my room 
Was it something I said 
Was it something I said 

Come up to my house 
Drink with my friends 
You can lay on my couch 
Achin to start all over again 
Going back to your room 
But wait a minute its my room 
Throwing up on my bed 
Was it something I said 

I hope we stay 
Thick as thieves, butter and bread 
Pillars of colonial homes 
And I wish I could shout you out 
False start 
Don't get your cane caught in the cracks 
Buckle your seatbelts, polluting the airwaves 
Single and lonely 

And you said you are 
Unconsolable 
And you said you are 
And you said you are 
Unconsolable 
Uncontrollable
