HANG ON

Well now I found myself
Wish I was someone else
My hands are stained with love
Wish I could take it away
I hid behind the shell
In time the pain will melt
My heart is stained with love
Wish I could fake it

I gave my life away
There's nothing left to say
I gave my life away
You take it in your way
You take it in your way

My selfish enemy
Still has the best of me
Empty and feeling numb
Wish I could take it away
I can't control the need
To weak to not concede
Wish I was deaf and dumb
Wish I could fake it
I gave my life away
There's nothing left to say
I gave my life away
You take it in your way

I gave my life away
There's nothing left to say
I gave my life away
You take it in your way
I can't pretend we're the same
I can't pretend we're the same
I can't pretend we're the same

Oh now I found myself
Wish I was someone else
My hands are stained with love
Wish I could fake
