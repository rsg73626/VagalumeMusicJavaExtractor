AHEAD OF MYSELF

Thought I was ready
Ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
That I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself

Guess I went ahead and jumped the gun again
Some shitty situation that I put you in
And I know we poured champagne
Maybe we was just too quick to celebrate

I thought I was ready
Ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
That I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of my

I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe

Know that I was first to say, "I love you, babe"
Moved my things to your apartment down on 2nd Street
I thought I'd cleaned the slate
But I guess I didn't clean it all away

Thought I was ready
Ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
That I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of my

I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah, baby
I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe, yeah, babe

I get ahead of myself
I get ahead of myself

Thought I was ready
Ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
That I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of my

I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah, babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah
