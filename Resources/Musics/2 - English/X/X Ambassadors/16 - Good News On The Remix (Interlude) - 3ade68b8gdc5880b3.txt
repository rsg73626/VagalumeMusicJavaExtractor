GOOD NEWS ON THE REMIX (INTERLUDE)

Dude. I got to hear it! I wanna fucking hear it!
I can't even like, I can't even process
what is going on right now, so, I like, like, need a moment
Hold on, I'm losing it

I got two phones, I'm trying to record you crying

I can't - I'm not crying, dude!

I'm recording you crying, man!

Fuck! You gotta send it to me, though!
Can you please send it to me?

I don't know what you're talking about

God damn it. Oh my God

Alright, man

Noo! Fuck you, man, this is so crazy!
Alright. I'll figure - ok. I'll tell the guys to get in on it

Ok, cool

Peace, man
