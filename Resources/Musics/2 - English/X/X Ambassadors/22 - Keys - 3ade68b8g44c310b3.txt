KEYS

Through the fire and through the ice
You're gonna be the last thing I'll ever see
Killed all the polar bears and the electric cars
The traitors on the covers of your magazines

And are you cold? shakin', are you fully awake?
Are you ready for the plunge, are you ready to take
Whatever happens now?  It's just a matter of faith
But I won't believe in it,

No no no I won't believe in it.
Only your keys
Lock away our young hearts
Keep me out of reach
Keep me safe from harm

Sound the alarm
Better to leave it, is it better to hide?
I never wanted to be better never thought I was right
For lack of evidence, and what my fingerprints exposed
Case closed?

So set the pipe bombs burning, it'll make you sweat
And all your lovers and their mothers, they won't let you forget it
So baby get on the ticket, baby foot me the bill
Somebody always pays
Someone has got to pay the price and I will.

Only your keys
Lock away our young hearts
Keep me out of reach
Keep me safe from harm
Sound the alarm
