KEROSENE DREAMS

Light it up, light it up
Come on light it up, light it up
Hold up your lighters
Cause tonight we on fire
Light it up, light it up
Come on light it up, light it up
Hold up your lighters
Cause tonight we on fire

Tell my ma take care of us
You know things looking perilous
All my siblings and cousins too
Man we for life, we can make it through
We can still persevere
Turn darkness in tears

Come on light it up, light it up
Come on and burn bright
My friends, when your world is caving in
Put your lighters in the air, air, air
Put your lighters in the air

Light it up, light it up
Come on light it up, light it up
Hold up your lighters
Cause tonight we on fire
Light it up, light it up
Come on light it up, light it up
Hold up your lighters
Cause tonight we on fire

Broken bottles on the floor
Broken promises and more
People come and people go
Just sit back and enjoy the show
Through the darkness and daze
Through the smoke and the haze

Come on light it up, light it up
Cause we gonna burn bright
My friends, when the darkest days ahead
Put your lighters in the air, air, air

Come on, turn up
You and me
Turn up, gasoline
Put your lighters in the air, air, air
Put your lighters in the air
Put your lighters in the air
Put your lighters in the air, air, air
Put your lighters in the air, air, air
Put your lighters in the air
Put your lighters in the air
