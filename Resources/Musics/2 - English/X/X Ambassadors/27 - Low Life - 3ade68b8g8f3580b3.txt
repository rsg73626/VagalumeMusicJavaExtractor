LOW LIFE

I need to see your (hey!)
I need to see your hands up
I need to see your (hey!)
I need to see you get, get, get

Low - we - oh (Dance!)
Low - we - oh (Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh (dance)
(I need to see your hands up) low (hey!)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh
(Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)

She had just dropped in, dropped in from Kansas
Big eyes, big thighs with a smokin' canvas
Well she ain't fly in on a bubble but
Waist thin, she a 10 with a bubble butt
She was all of that, so I hooked her up
With a rhinestone red bottom ruby pump
She can whip that thing like a cyclone
Hope you got slow motion on your iphone
If ya got, cake, cake, cake for the guards
You can, take, take, take it to Oz
But on the way, she found a gay
She said, "show me what you're working with, "
He said, "heey! "
Click Click them heels for me
Make it rain emerald bills for me
Let me pop that thing like a poppy

Oh baby, I wanna, I wanna dance, dance all night
And I wanna, I wanna get, get my life
And I'm gonna, I'm gonna get lost in the lights
Turn up, I'm the wizard I pronounce you to
Like somebody dropped a motherf- house on you

Low - we - oh (Dance!)
Low - we - oh (Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh (dance)
(I need to see your hands up) low (hey!)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh
(Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)

MM it's going down, timber
Never seen a tinman on Tinder
But he had that sex appeal
Swipe right? cause I knew he had buns of steel
So we hit that yellow brick boulevard
Through a jungle party, they was goin' hard
Elephants twerkin', monkeys that fly
"Lions, tigers, bears oh my! "
Had to run, there's no place like mi casa
Met the king of the jungle looking like Mufasa
He said, "No booty, no use in trying"
He turned around, we said, "man, you lyin"
He had cake, cake for days
Got lost in the jiggle had to download Waze
You can look, but no touchin'
Now everybody get low like a munchkin

Oh baby, I wanna, I wanna dance, dance all night
And I wanna, I wanna get, get my life
And I'm gonna, I'm gonna get lost in the lights
Turn up-side down like an hourglass

Low - we - oh (Dance!)
Low - we - oh (Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh (dance)
(I need to see your hands up) low (hey!)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh
(Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)
(I need to see your hands up)

Now when you hear that beat, you better be on your feet
Put your hands on your knees and get low (get low)
And when that bass comes through
You already know what to do
Find your bae or your boo and get low (get low)

Low - we - oh (Dance!)
Low - we - oh (Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh (dance)
(I need to see your hands up) low (hey!)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh
(Dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)

Low - we - oh (dance)
Low - we - oh (dance the house down, the house down, sick? em)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh (dance)
(I-I need to see your hands up) low (hey!)
(I need to see your) low - we - oh
I need to see you get, get low
