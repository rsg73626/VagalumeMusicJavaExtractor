SITTING SIDEWAYS

(feat. big pokey)
[chorus 2x]
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a sunday night I might bang me some maze

[paul wall talking]
Swisha house, big pokey and paul wall baby

[paul wall]
It's the people's champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school impala
I'm with that big bank hank, that poppi joe and box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'

Ho's that diss me in the club, the same 
ho's in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the jag, acting bad with t ferris
Open mouth and showcase ice, 
and you gon' see about 20 karats

I'm what they do, you on 5-9 double o
In the tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that swisha house with archie lee and couda bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts

Say cheese and show my fronts, it's more carrots/
karats than bugs bunny's lunch
It's paul wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil, and I'm paid plus I'm sittin' sideways

[chorus]
[paul wall]
What it do
I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills

I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank

Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some "honey love" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive

I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping
Look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sideways
