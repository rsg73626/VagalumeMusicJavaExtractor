ENEMIES

Yall muthafuckas better keep yall eyes open(Ha) 
You ain't gotta see ay muthafucka to get hit 

I got some enemies 
I know they coming to get me 
And if I gotta die taking some yall with me 
They best to be prepared for this war 
Cause I'm get cha 
I gotta infa-red 
It's guarenteed to hit cha 
Got a hole click of muthafuckas 
Call them souljas 
16,17 knockin heads of ah sholders 
I told ya 
We all screamin loud cause we bout it 
I'm stunntin throught my hood 
Get your pussy ass crowded 
Bitch I'm from that route 
Strictley bout that g'z 
Knockin of enemies with them two 23es 
Gotta get em for they cheese 
Pass It to tha bg's 
Them niggas we don't know 
See ya can't get these 
All I know is money 
All I see is greed 
Bustin Heads to the fact 
Trigga finger on tha squeeze 
Nigga please 
Iheard you was workin for them focks 
That's tha reason you bitch ass niggas gotta go 
Enemies with no faces 

Chorus 
Enemies Enemies 
Enemis with no faces (x4) 

We loced up and we still on a mission 
Ridein four deep 
2000 Expedition 
Got a hole click and we strapped 
Case we get into some shit 
Gotta keep them in there place 
Niggas all in my face 
Fuck All these hoes and these no nos 
And ride on some 22es low pros 
And some mo mo 
Kickin in your front door 
Lookin for them mo z's 
Strapped with them 44es 
A click full of bg's 
Alot of yall niggas still believe it's a game 
Sence I made a come up 
That shit bout to change 
Either yall can roll with tha click that I'm with 
Or every time I see you 
We get off in your shit 
If you can't stand the heat
