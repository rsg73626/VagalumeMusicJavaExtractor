THE PARTY'S OVER

The name is Cobb Knobbler
And you're here with me now

I'll tell ya punks, the name's Cobb Knobbler
Satanic Nazi, Weenie gobbler
I was in the 'Nam, now I'm on the lam
Joined up with the X-Cops, kickin' ass and porkin' chops

The party's over
I wear a uniform
The party's over
I wanna keep you warm

These are moments that I treasure
Agony is placed with pleasure
I know I'll do my duty
I'll restrain my gay-boy booty

The party's over
I wear a uniform
The party's over
I wanna keep you warm

I tried to die and then I cried
Really had to look inside
What it was that got me here
I am just a big fat queer

Sacrifice a goat, slice your fucking throat
That's right punk, I'm also on junk

The party's over
The party's over

Well I love to look at Hitler's maps
Hobnail boots and leather chaps
I used to live in San Francisco
Drop your drawers and pass the crisco

Now I'm naked on display, all the bad guys know I'm gay
They line up around the block, to suck the ghost of Hitler's cock

Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
