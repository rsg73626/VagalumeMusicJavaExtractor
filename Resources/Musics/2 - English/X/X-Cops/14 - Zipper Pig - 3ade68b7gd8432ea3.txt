ZIPPER PIG

Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh
Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh

I got the call at 3.33
I arrived at the scene
It was a masonic conspiracy
You don't know what I mean

Crystal meth lab raid
Was the scene of my shame
All my skin got burned away
Now you know my name

Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh
Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh

All their planted evidence
Was 911 around me
Exploded in my face
Hot as 33 degrees!
Bad Mason, Bad Cop
I was really mean
All my skin was burned away
No time to scream
I was once a human being
Just like you and you
Now I'm in a drippy mess
My face was turned to goo
I want vengeance on the ones
Who burned me black and blue
But I know I'll never touch them
I guess you'll have to do

Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh
Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh
Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh
Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Zipperpig, Oh
AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH
