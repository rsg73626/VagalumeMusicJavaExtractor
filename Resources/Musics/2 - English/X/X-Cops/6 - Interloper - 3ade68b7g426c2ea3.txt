INTERLOPER

X-Copy patrol your streets tonight
and we will judge what's wrong and right

And if you interfere
With what we're doing here
It's your unlucky day
We'll blow your ass away

But if you fuck around
Then you'll be goin down
We'll beat you to your knees
You are the enemy
Because we wear a shield
We have the right to kill
And if the guiltless die
We turn a blind eye

We turn a blind eye
We turn a blind eye
We turn a blind eye

Blind Eye
