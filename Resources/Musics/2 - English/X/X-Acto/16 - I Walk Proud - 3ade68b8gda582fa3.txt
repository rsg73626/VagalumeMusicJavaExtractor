I WALK PROUD

It's getting colder,
Every step of this way,
And i fell like i'm all alone,
But i've got to carry on.
Because i know these feeling is right,
And i' ll never lose, My sight,my heart's exploding...man,
Exploding! because the path i choose is hard,
But it's setting me apart,
From this cruel society,
Where there is no place for me!
I walk proud! i walk fuckin proud!
This is my life, this is also my strife,
And if you can't understand this,
I'm gonna leave you behind.
'cause i fight and always will,
'cause i have an iron will,
'cause i'll never turn my back,
'cause i'll be onthe attack,
'cause i'd like to change your ways,
'cause i'm gonna fight their ways,
I just told you how it is,
And that's why i fell this.
Iwalk proud! i walk fuckin' proud!
The insurrection is on the rise join the fight!
This is my life; this is my strife;
These are my ways: the way i love,
The way i hate darkeste age, blackskies,
Toxic oceans, the erath dries, africa's starvin',
That's how it is because the rich man wants some beef.
Greed and power make their victims: crying poor young
Children...but you can't understand - can you?
So why don't you fight - can't you?
We are the ones - fight them!
You are the ones - fight then!
We all have to fight with our own hands.
I walk proud! i walk fuckin' pround!
