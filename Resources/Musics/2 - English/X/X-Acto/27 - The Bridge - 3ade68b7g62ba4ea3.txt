THE BRIDGE

THIS TIME
I WON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE
I WAS STRIVING SO HARD TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD
THAT I FORGOT WHERE THAT ROAD WOULD LEAD ME
OF COURSE I WAS LOST
FIGHTING THE TIDE WITH ALL MY STRENGH
NOW I'M FEELING WEAK
BUT WHAT DID I EXPECT?
(CHORUS)
WE NEED TO FIND, TO FIND A BRIDGE
A NEW WAY TO SET THINGS RIGHT
ENOUGHT OF FOLLOWING OTHER PEOPLE'S FOOTSTEPS
I'LL MAKE MINE
EVEN WITH MY EYES SHUT TIGHT
I CAN SEE I WAS NOT LIVING MY LIFE
THIS FIGHT MEANT TO SET ME FREE 
ALMOST RUINNED THE BEST IN ME
I WANTED THE FLAMES TO GROWN HIGHER
BUT I LOST MYSELF IN THE FIRE
AND ALL BURNED OUT
NO ONE ELSE COULD EAR MY SHOUT
(CHORUS)
THAT NEGATIVE STRIFE
THOSE NEGATIVE WAYS THAT SOME CALL "LIFE"
ALMOST RUINNED THE BEST IN ME
THE FLAME OF KINDNESS AND HONESTY
(CHORUS)
