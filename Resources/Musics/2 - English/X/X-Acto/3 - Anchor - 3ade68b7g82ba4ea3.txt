ANCHOR

Too fast, we're going to fast, 
living the future and mourning the past, 
set your priorities, 
live today, that's why i scream to say: 
i want my life back, anchor, and i,
i'm gonna get it back, anchor. 
slow down and take a look around, 
we're all living someone else's life, 
the few who don't are cast aside 
- be strong this is your life! 
i want my life back, anchor, and i, 
i'm gonna get it back, no matter what. 
your pace corrupts me, but now, 
i'm gonna break free. 
i've got to break free from your mind, 
i've got to drop my anchor, 
slow down, live here now for today. 
i need to pull my breaks on slap my face, 
this time i'm lost inside, 
inside myself living a lie. anchor. 
blissfulness, live your life to the fullest, 
enjoy each and everyday, 
like if it is your last day here. 
i want my life back, anchor, 
and i'm, i'm gonna get it back, 
no matter what, anchor
