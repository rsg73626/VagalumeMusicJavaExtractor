POWERLESS

You're laying down, too weak even a speak,
I see your desperate eyes, crying, looking for me.
I wish that i could help you but i can't stop a war.
I watch you helpless, lying there, it's just not fair.
It's sad... and i fight these tears so hard
' cause there's nothing i can do to stop it,
I just turn away... i feel so fuckinÂ´ weak,
Watching you cry and bleed.
I place my hands on the tv screen but
You're so far away from me.
Powerless i watch it all happen again,
Blood drops from my tv night after night,
Day after day. man i'm so scarred,
Today i saw then again, but i felt nothing,
Can you belive me? not a fuckin' thing!
And i fought those tears so hard but there
Was nothing i could do to stop it
So i just turned away...i felt so fuckin' weak,
Watching you cry and bleed.
Placed my hands on the tv screen
But you're so far away from me.
So much sickness. so much pain. so much grief.
So many lost in vain. so much violence. so much war.
But i hope for a better day, a better day to come.
I still belive in brighter days,
Or my life would fall apart,
I can't surrender and walk away...
Maybe some other day when i turn on the tv
Set i'll fell again the pain.
I'll know then - "i'm alive again!".
