CHOICES

There are things so important, so important to me,
And i feel so sad when i see,
That you turn your head away, and pretend all is ok.
I could not belive my eyes when i saw you run and hide.
How could i've been so naive
- i wanted you to be just like me. we med our choices,
Went separate ways, but i still love you,
When i recall those days, when we were together,
And we thought we would fight forever, together...
I guess you choose the best for you...
Now i have double thoughts any time i meet someone new.
The same fuckin' prejudice, again i expect too much
From you. i want you to never lie, need truthful
Friends right by my side.
I need you to be yourself, i love you, the way you are.
We made our choice, went separate ways, but still love
You, when i recall those days, when we were together,
And we though we would fight forever, together...
I guess you choose the best for you...
Now i've got my goals in sight,
I know what's wrong, o know what's right.
And we'll do our best this time! together...
We made our choices, went separate ways,
But i still love you, when i recall those days,
When we are together, and we thought
We would fight forever, together...
I guess you choose the best for you.
Tear down those walls with me,
I'll reach your hand, i'll help you see,
There's do much more you can do,
I know it's not easy, but i'm here for you.
I'll be there to back you up,
Help you out and cheer you up.
I belive so much in you and i can't be wrong,
Be wrong this time...
