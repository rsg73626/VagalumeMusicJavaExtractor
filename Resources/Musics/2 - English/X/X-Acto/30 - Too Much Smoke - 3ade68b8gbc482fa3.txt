TOO MUCH SMOKE

Enought of your bullshit about humam rights
Because now we know you compromise.
And every time you light tha shit,
You're just asking for it!
Killing yourself is a cigarette!
I'm tired of seeing with bloodshot eyes
My brother and sisters smoking inside,
Blowing their poison, killing their air,
Well now we know they just don't care!
Respect! it's all i'm asking here!
Oppression! it's all you have to give!??
Well i thought you were my friend,
But you're killing me instead,
You are hurting me inside. is it that hard?
I'm tired of seeing with bloodshot eyes
My brothers and sisters smoking inside,
Blowing their poison, killing the air,
Well now we know they just don't fucin' care!
Don't need that shit again,
More than three millions dead,
Don't want to pay the price,
Don't steal my life!
I'm tired of seeing with bloodshot eyes
My brothers and sisters smoking inside,
Blowing their poison killing the air,
Well now we know they just, don't care!
I want to be with you but not with yor smoke,
Tobacco corporate- death is gonna kill us both.
There are no smokers' rights,
That can give you the right,
To disrepespect me, and to smoke inside.
This is no "straight edge fighting",
This time we must unite. do it for all of us,
Stop smoking inside. thank you!
