BACKWASH

POINTING FINGERS, CALLING NAMES
SPREADING RUMOURS - IT'S ALL THE SAME
WORDS ARE SPOKEN, EYES ARE SHUT
IT'S SAD, YOU LOVE TO HURT
(CHORUS)
SPREADING POISON EVERYWHERE
HURTING PEOPLE WITHOUT A CARE
BUT ONE DAY YOU'LL GET YOURS
BACKWASH
"LIES DESTROY FRIENDSHIP
YOUR CHEAP TALK DOESN'T MEAN SHIT
YOUR WORDS ARE BUILD TO BREAK"
YOU'RE CHOOSING YOUR OWN FATE
(CHORUS)
YOU SPREAD YOUR POISON EVERYWHERE,
AND YOU'RE HURTING PEOPLE
WITHOUT A CARE - I THINK IT'S SAD
BUT ONE DAY THAT DIRTY WATER
WILL COME BACK WITH THE TIDE
MAYBE THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THIS
MAYBE THEN YOU'LL OPEN YOUR EYES
(CHORUS)
