UPGRADE

Sometimes
To upgrade is not enought
We have to change our minds
Taht's the only way
(chorus)
I thought i would overcome
I thought i'd never fall into the same trap again
But i was so wrong
Because i did all again
With different colors and different words
But still the same
I did the same
Enought of fucking up
Enought of past mistakes
I've no more precious time to waste
(chorus)
Enought, it's time for a change!
I try to make up, try to make up
For all those mistakes
I wrongly thought too many times
"i've changed myself"
But in the end i was still the same
Playing the same old game:
Upgrading, upgrading, up grading, but never changing
And i'm so full of buying the same lie
With a different color shinning bright! (x2)
