ENTERTAINMENT

YEAH I COULD NOT BELIVE IT
BECAUSE IT ENDED AS FAST AS IT BEGUN
AND WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO
TO DO WITH ALL THAT LOVE
(CHORUS)
I NEVER THOUGHT OF ME AS "ENTERTAINMENT"
I NEVER THOUGHT OF ME AS A PRODUCT OF FILL YOUR EMPTY LIFE
NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HURT SO MUCH
TO TRUST AND LOVE SOMEONE
I'M NOT A TOY TO BE PLAYED AROUND 
I'M NOT AN OBJECT, I'M NOT A TROPHY
AND I AM MORE THAN JUST THIS BODY
IT'S SO DAMN SIMPLE!
(CHORUS)
I WAS CHASING ILLUSIONS AND CHASING LIES
AND WHEN I OPENED UP MY EYES
I COULDN'T DEAL WITH ALL THE PAIN
I CRIED AND I LIED AND I'M TRYING TO LEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND
MEMORIES BLACK HOLE, SUCKING MY ENERGY AWAY
WHEN MY ILLUSIONS ENDED I TRIED TO PRETEND 
THAT EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME - BUT IT WAS NOT
AND I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT I SAW!
- YOU ARE NOT THEPERSON I ONCE KNEW
I GUESS I NEVER REALLY FUCKING KNEW YOU!
I FOUGHT SO HARD, I WAS SO FUCKIN' WEAK
THEN I FOUND MYSELF, I'LL NEVER BE BACK ON MY KNEES
NOW I'VE GOT MY STRENGHT (BACK), AND I'M SICK OF ALL THIS SHIT
I DID RISE A STRONGER MAN
BUT I WON'T FORGET WHAT YOU DID TO ME
