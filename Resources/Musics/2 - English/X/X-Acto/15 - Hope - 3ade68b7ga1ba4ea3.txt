HOPE

I'M SORRY FOR YOU IT'S ONLY MUSIC
I'M SORRY FOR YOU IT'S ABOUT DRUGS
I'M SORRY FOR YOU IT'S JUST AFASHION
I'M SORRY IT'S ABOUT PLAYING THOUGHT
AND I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY
THIS RESTLESS SPIRIT RUNNING FREE IN OUR VEINS
'CAUSE WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
WE OWN THE SKY
I'M SORRY FOR YOU IT'S ABOUT MOSHING
I'M SORRY IT'S ABOUT GETTING DRUNK
I'M SORRY IT'S ABOUT HURTING PEOPLE
I'M SORRY IT'S ABOUT BUYING STUFF
AND I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY
THIS RESTLESS SPIRIT RUNNING FREE IN OUR VEINS
AND I HOPE YOU WILL FEEL TOO
THIS ENERGY THE WOW TO FIND THE TRUTH
AND I HOPE WE'LL NEVER BRECK APART
BECAUSE THE WAY IS IN OUR MINDS AND HEARTS
'CAUSE WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
WE OWN THE SKY
TOGETHER
