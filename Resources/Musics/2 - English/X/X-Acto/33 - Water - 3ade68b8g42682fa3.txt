WATER

I can't make up
Your world makes me throw up
I pity you with ways and lies and peatty lies
Man, you're so damn blind
I try to look at what you do
From a positive point of view
Please tell me why can't i see nothing
Nothing good in you
(chorus)
And i won't break - integrity
You won't get the best of me
You would love
To force me to fit in
Make me a slave to your greed and games
To your cruelty, brutal socirty
You think i'll be all alone
Left in a corner all by my own
But you're as wrong as you can be
There are thousands of people living just like me
(chorus)
And you can't break water
You think tou're in control
You are on top of everything
You think you have seen it all
But you don't - you don't!
I' m as weak and flexible as the rain that falls
You're as hard and hardened as a raging bull
Here is something simple to make you think
Water can make a rock thin
And you, you can't break water
There are some things that can't be taimmed
Tehre are some things that can't be changed
Like water, water (x2)
