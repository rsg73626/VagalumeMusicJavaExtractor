THE NEW CHILD

Power tripping on the vulnerable, on the easily exploitable,
we go against their nature, we cut them in half. 
we are crippling every child, 
we're molding them into idiots and then 
we wonder what's wrong with this world... 
they're born wild let them blossom, 
give them love and independence, 
let them grow happy and free, 
the new child. we are crippling every child, 
we're molding them into idiots, 
answers given, no questions asked, 
and no matter how hard you try it a 
lotus will never be a rose, 
it just can't be a rose. 
break the cycle! we say: "be just like me" 
and we ensure they'll do the same mistakes 
that we have always made they're condemned 
when standing on their feet and appreciated 
when the imitate. "be what i want so much to be, 
the dreams my parents killed for me" 
- it's about time we break this cycle,
no more forcing, let them be... 
your conditionning kills inteligence.
