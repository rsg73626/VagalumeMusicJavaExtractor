COMPASSION

CAN YOU SEE THE BLOOD?
YEAH BUT STILL YPU TURN YPUR HEAD AWAY
AND YOU PRETEND ALL IS O.K.
YOU'RE SOAKED RED WET AND YOU FORGET
WITHOUT COMPASSION AND RESPECT
YOUR LIFE WILL LEAD YOU, WILL LEAD YOU NOWHERE
(CHORUS)
CAN YOU LIVE SIMPLE SO OTHERS MAY SIMPLE LIVE?
WILL YOU MAKE THAT EFFORT? WILL YOU? START TO CARE!
CAN YOU EAR THE CRIES?
CAN YOU LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYES
AND SAY YOU DIDN'T LOST YOUR MIND?
BECAUSE WE LEAVE A TRAIL OD DEATH
OF AGONIZING PAIN A THEFT
OF SO MANY SLAUGHTERED, SO MANY FORGOTTEN
(CHORUS)
THERE'S NO PEACE IN A SLAUGHTER HOUSE (X2)
THERE'S NO PEACE IN THE SEAS
THERE'S NO PEACE IN A LABORATORY
STAND UP FOR RESPECT, COMPASSION AND LOVE
VEGANISM
(CHORUS)
