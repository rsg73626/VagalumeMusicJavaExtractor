THE PACE

It's not my fault there is right and wrong
And there are kids growing smart and strong
Changing their lifes, ways and hearts
I want do what i can do maybe the problem lays inside you
I'm not the one who (still) lives in the past
(chorus)
It's time to move forward,
Let the ideas grow and breed
Reach a new level of knowledge,
Please let the new kids set the pace
We don't claim to have all theanswers,
But there is so much more you can
Do, please keep your mind open,
Because we all need you
You say "veganism has no place here",
You say we're splitting up the scene
You say "the dance floor is to fight",
This is about improvement and respect,
And i think it's time to move ahead,
We can't afford to lose more time
(chorus)
