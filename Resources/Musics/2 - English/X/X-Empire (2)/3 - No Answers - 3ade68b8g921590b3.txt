NO ANSWERS

The days are gone
and there goes my soul
I'm so confused, I can't control myself
I live refusing false offers
But in the end we all become one

Becoming one
I can't not feel
Becoming one
the pain is real

I know there is no answers
the time was gone
and alone with it the way
that would take me out of here

and everything that I lived
begins to be corroded by hate
and my heart of stone
back to have more faith

Locked in an old cage
by ghosts of the past
I hear the steps
and key rattling around me
