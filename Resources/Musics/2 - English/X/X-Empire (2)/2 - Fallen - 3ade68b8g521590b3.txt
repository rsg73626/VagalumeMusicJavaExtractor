FALLEN

Searching for pieces of me
Sometimes I feel insane
Everytime I sleep
I'm not always sure
That there is a new day

Denied!
The pleasure
Slave of pain

Whats am I?
As a fallen angel
It's desperate cry

When The end
Becomes beginning
Where I began

And my mind
is playing with me
Destroying my dreams

I'm fallen

Guess I'm not
Having fun

Dead friends
Killed choice
Torn

Still I smile?

A child dies
And something is born
The madman remains

I'm fallen
