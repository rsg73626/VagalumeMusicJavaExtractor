WARCRY

I fight!
and never surrender
Breakdown
and over again

Side by side
of a great pretender
Seek the truth
or no more

Playing with your lives
right here
your pain inside
insanity!

Can you hear my war cry?
Save your soul, and fight for your life

Choose another day to die
hear my cry
my war cry

save your life
the sorrow emperor
why? nothing is forever
one bound
one more conception
fight and fight
and never surrender!
