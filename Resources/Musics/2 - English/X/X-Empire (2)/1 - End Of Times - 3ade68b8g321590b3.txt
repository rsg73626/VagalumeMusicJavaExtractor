END OF TIMES

Foolish humanity
Destroying where they live
Innocent blood on the ground
Listen to the voices
The nature made it's choice

Welcome to the end
only ones are pain and truth
and I once again
Dont see the way! Now!

The end of times
you no denied and no afraid

(And I close my eyes)

Whats your time?
you have denied
and awaits the end of times

And I start again
And over, and over
I am surrender

And I start again
And over, and over
I'll never surrender

And you sold your soul
For your corrosive greed
Consequences
And you lost your humanity

And your deserve to die
and no one will hear your cry!

Welcome to the end
only ones are pain and truth
and I once again
Don't see the way! Now!

And I feel the pain
my face broke the truth
lies flying in my head
And I can't see (now)
