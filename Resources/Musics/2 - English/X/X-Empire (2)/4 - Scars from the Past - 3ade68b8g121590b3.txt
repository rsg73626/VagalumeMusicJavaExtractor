SCARS FROM THE PAST

(I'm not dead
I believe in myself
rising from heaven
only time will tell)

Now, this time and space
I'm still in the place
Somethings don't change
When I Look at your face
It turns the light before my eyes
you will not betray me
The hand that saved you

Scars! inside my soul
Lost! in a empty world
I have to keep my faith
I have to hear what you gonna say
Say its alright
Lie to me again

Empty words
Dont make you a better man
I'll beat harder
You'll feel whats
you never felt
And You'll know
the pain is real

Scars! inside my soul
Lost! in a empty world
I have to keep my faith
I have to hear what you gonna say
The consequences of past arise
and no time to cry
erasing bad days front my eyes
dont let the pain inside of you
