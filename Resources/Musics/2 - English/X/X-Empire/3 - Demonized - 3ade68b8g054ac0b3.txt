DEMONIZED

They just don't know me
But judge me like a serpent

Leaded by the unknown fear
Portrays me as wicked and grim
Seeking to demonize one side in conflict
Generating robots programed to hate and kill
There is a master brain behind the courtains

Choose the wrong side you will be venerate
Choose the right side you will be Demonized

Another distorted reality drives you insane
Search for reason, to follow a new horizon
They ripped all our integrity throwing
it all to ashes

We were demonized

We are slaves of mankind
And all races will have their peace denied

The end of integrity
Is suffocating me
Lost in this world of grey
And becomes my darkest days
Where all masks fall
We're just demonized
So let it die
Just let it die
