LET IT DIE (FEAT. CHRIS CLANCY)

Can you feel my sorrow?
And now you pay the price!

In your lies
I was believing
Always and asking why?

Your flaws
Created my suffering
And no one, heard you cry

Creating my hate
Leaving old things
You on my knees
You pay

So let it die
You have to go
Don't hear your cry
Our love is gone

So let it die
Your truth is done
Won't hear your cry

So let it die!

In other dimension
Slaves blind by pleasure
Sick and torment
Wondering in nothing

And you have to say? (hello?)
And you have to say? (have to say)
(hello?)
(hello! bitch!)
And you have to say? (have to say)
And you have to say? (have to say)

Lie To Me!
Feeling Pain!
Lie To Me!
Feeling Pain!
