LOST

[Dark]
What is a man
But a miserable pile of secrets!

[Light]
God is with me, monster!

[Dark]

That will be your ruin!

[Light]

The stench of your soul is disgusting
I will purge the world of your presence

[Dark]

I was like you once

That why the power of your god
cannot destroy me
Because I'm his chosen one!

[Light]

You? the chosen one?

[Dark]

The roots of evil run deep. Irreversibly so in the heart's of men

[Light]

Back to hell demon!

[Dark]

Their destiny... I was their most devoted warrior
A Champion of Light

[Light]

What you doing?
What you doing?
No!

[Dark]

But I fell. Fell into darkness!


I lost my life
And let me die

I lost my life
And let me die

I lost my life
Stuck in my pride

I close the door of my dreams
My life is a great impossibility
Every step I take is a mistake
And nothing else works for me

I'm Broken
I'm so Fucked
Drowning in the deepest sewer
I'm needed
I'm Screaming
But now I Surrender to My fate

Loneliness makes me fade away
When the darkness creating
Drowns me in a deepest pain

I lost my life
And let me die

I lost my life
And let me die

It's like a poison inside of me
Killing little by little
There's not a way to stop the blood
Ashes to ashes dust to dust

I'll put the gun upon my head
And nobody can stop me
My destiny's already traced
Shed my blood, insanity ends!

Loneliness makes me fade away
When the darkness creating
Drowns me in a deepest pain

I'm so lost now
And I can't save myself
I'm dead

Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you understand?

I'm Falling

Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you understand?

I'm Dying

Makes me fade away
When the darkness creating
Drowns me in a deepest pain

I lost my life
And let me die

I lost my life
And let me die

I lost my life
Stuck in my pride

[Light]

Christus vivit. Christus regnat
Christus ab omni malo te defendat
maledicti et excomunnicat daemones
invirturte istorum factorum Dei nominum

[Dark]

I was like you once

[Light Dark]

quode unque maleficium nocere ei
incantationem. neque... in anima nec in
corpore!

[Dark]

That is my vengeance!
