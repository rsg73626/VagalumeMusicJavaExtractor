SUFFOCATING ME

Your world in self destruction
(Destruction)
Your mind in self destruction
(Destruction)

And I tried to say
Welcome to your insanity
Inside a blind faith
You choose your destiny

And suffocating me
And hearing cries in vain
And suffering withi n
Try to release your pain

And suffocating me
Erasing from my fate
And hear your cries in vain

And Suffocating Me

Many times
What do you are?
(do you are)

Many times
What do you need?
(do you need)

Your own inside war!
(Inside war!)

Release the insanity!

And suffocating me
And hearing cries in vain
And suffering within
Try to release your pain

And suffocating me
Erasing from my fate
And hear your cries in vain

And Suffocating Me

Release yourself
Release your pain
Release yourself
Welcome to your insanity
