THE END OF INTEGRITY

Show your face before my eyes
Show me what you have inside
No matter how good you are
Nobody gives a shit after your fall

I feell I'm going under
The basics of moral has died
Changing the tears for blood
No one cares when all is lost

Oh! this is The End Of Integrity
The world is dying and I'm bound to see

Consuming me!

Apocalypse is coming out
Where the people kill for food
Children withering till death
Our innocence going to ashes

I feell I'm going under
The basics of moral has died
Changing the tears for blood
No one cares when all is lost

Oh! this is The End Of Integrity
The world is dying and I'm bound to see

Oh! this is the end of integrity
The world is dying and I'm bound to see
Oh! this is the end of integrity
The world is dying and I'm bound to see
