MY DARKEST DAYS

No words to say
And live insane
This dirty dreams
Your reality

No words to say
And living in pain
Your dirty dreams
Around your head

This dark answers
Inside of me
And someone to be
In a dark tower
And shred my skin

Many times
I believe you (I believe you)
Many times
You don't say the truth (don't say the truth)

And you don't come back
Waiting, for one more attack

And make anything
Suffering for nothing
I have no words to say
Welcome to My Darkest Days!

Sometimes
Confused
And I looked in the mirror

Many times
I Refuse
When I look to the window

Forgive me
I have no words to say
Forget me
No reasons to stay
