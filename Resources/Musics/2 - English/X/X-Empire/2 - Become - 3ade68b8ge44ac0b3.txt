BECOME

Dark clouds
Above the sky
Grey smoke
Front off your eyes

This time you're bleeding
This time you're deceiving
And now you have to go

And now you stay
I'm fading away
I'm tried to turn the page (The page)

Your words apart
You know my heart
And make me feel the pain (The Pain)

And every single day
I'm fading away
I'm forget you
To hide the pain

I'm losing
I know it
Slave than
I Become

My heart is burning
The hate is no returning

My past is burning
And no returning!
