ALL MASKS FALL

What's your life?
What's your breeding?
And still alone
Fucking your life and tell me
This makes you strong?

And what you have to say?
I don't forget

Why
You live in lies?
Suffer
I'm don't forget!

All Masks Fall
And tears no more
You disobeyed
My dying friend

Your Masks Fall
My hate be strong
And you will pay
Your blame again

What's your life?
What's your breeding?
And still alone
Fucking my life and tell me
This makes you so cold?

And what you say about me?
I won't forgive

All times betraying me
Your honor is a shame

All times betraying me
your life is a blame

All times

You lie to me!

So strong, standing strong
Standing strong
Standing strong
Standing strong

All Masks Fall, Out!
