WORLD IN GREY

Words written in blood
The words of loss
With no tomorrow

Violence
Overtaken us
Leading us to the fall

To the fall!

World in chaos
World in grey
Full of corruption
It's all in vain

What is the meaning?
Where we make
Mistakes?
Just show us the way
Search for freedom
Away from the empire of Greed
Washing our wicked sins away

Damned souls
Consumed by hungry
The limit comes
With a desperate cry
No hope for life
No place for affection
We are the sons
Of a broken home

World in chaos
World in grey
Full of corruption
It all in vain

Spreading fear
Everywhere
No way to run
nowhere to hide
Spreading fear all the time
