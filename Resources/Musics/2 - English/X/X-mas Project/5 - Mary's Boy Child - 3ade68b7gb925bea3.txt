MARY'S BOY CHILD

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible says
Mary's boychild, Satanas
Was born on Christmas Day

Can you hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

Can you hear the angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

While sheperds watched their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
Hear a choir sing the song
Music seemed to come from afar

Can you hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

Can you hear the angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
They find no place to born the child
Not a single room was in sight

Can you hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

Can you hear the angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

Can you hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day

Can you hear the angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day
