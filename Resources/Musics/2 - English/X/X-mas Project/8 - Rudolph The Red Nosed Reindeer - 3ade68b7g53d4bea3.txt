RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeers
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
You'll go down in history
You'll go down in history
You'll go down in history
