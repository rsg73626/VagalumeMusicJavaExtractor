RUN, RUDOLPH, RUN

Out of all the reindeer, you know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph, Vixen can't be far behind
Run run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
Said Santa to the boy child what would you be longing for
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
And so went Rudolph streaking like a shooting star
Run run Rudloph Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round

Said Santa to the girl child what would you be pleased most to get
A .........to keep my little pussy wet
Then away went Rudolph streaking like a Citation jet

Run run Rudolph Santa got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
Run run Rudolph
Run run Rudolph
Run run Rudolph
Run run Rudolph
Run
