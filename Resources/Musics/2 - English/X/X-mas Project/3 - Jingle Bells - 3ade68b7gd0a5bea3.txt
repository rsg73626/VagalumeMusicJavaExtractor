JINGLE BELLS

we wish you a merry Christmas
we wish you a merry Christmas
we wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy new Year

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
