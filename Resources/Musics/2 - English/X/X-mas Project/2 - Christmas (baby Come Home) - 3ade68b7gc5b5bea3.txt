CHRISTMAS (BABY COME HOME)

It's Christmas
baby, please come home

Oh! The snow's coming down (Christmas)
Now I'm watchin' it fall (Christmas)
All the people around (Christmas)
Baby please come home! (Christmas)
The church bells in town (Christmas)
Oh they're singin' our song (Christmas)
Oh happy sounds (Christmas)
Baby please come home!

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year (Christmas)

The lights on the trees (Christmas)
I'm watching them shine (Christmas)
Wish you were here with me (Christmas)
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year (Christmas)
If there was a way (Christmas)
I'd hold back this tear (Christmas)
But it's Christmas day (Christmas)
Baby please come home!
Baby please come home
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home
