B-BOY PUNK ROCK 2001

Feat. Whitey Ford (Everlast)

check it out y'all (Scratching) 

[Whitey Ford] 
Whitey Ford. X-Ecutioner style 

Emcee am I people call me Ev 
when I'm bustin' up the party hear my engine rev 
With high resolution in the late p.m 
X-Men scratch the beat while i drop this gem 
Got tints on my windows so you can't see in 
pack it up pack it in baby once again. 
Ain't no way to check me (check me) 
No way to wreck me (wreck me) 
And shit gets hectic if you disrespectin. 
Stiller than night I'ma see my light 
On the top of the Marquee kid bill me right 
You know it ain't right, but yo it's ok 
see this type of shit happens everyday 

(scratching) 
You see this type of shit happens everyday 
(scratching) 
You know this type of shit happens everyday 
(scratching) 

It goes one for the thugs, two for the chickens 
peckerwood stats classic like slim pickins 
Fuck the Democrats, and the Republicans 
got all your cars bouncin' like a bunch of Mexicans 
Porter rock style I'll Touch you like Tony 
you claim to keep it real but still comin' out phony. 
It's just one emcee and four dj's 
give us six turntables and a mic to blaze. 
I'ma said it like Pun in the house of fun 
I burn hotter than the heat that's made by sun. 
Got a gun, ain't a uzi, but it weighes a ton 
It's B-Boy punk rock 2001

World keeps spinnin'. X-Men keep winnin 
X-Men keep winnin. X-Men keep winnin 
It's B-Boy punk rock 2001. It's B-Boy punk rock 2001
