IT'S GOING DOWN

this song is called 'it's going down' 
are you ready? help me out yall 

when i say it's going you say down
it's going down, it's going down' (x3)
when i say it's going everybody down 
it's going down 

check it out 

it's goin' down 
the rhythm projects 'round the next sound 
reflects the complex hybrid dialect now 
detect the mesh of many elements compressed down 
the melting pot of a super-futureesque style 
the combination of a vocal caress 
with lungs that gasp for breath 
from emotional stress 
with special effects 
and a distorted collage 
carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage 

it's going down 

put it out for the world see 
lp and x-men to the 10th degree 
everybody in the world to see 
when we melt down the acts with the weaponry 
it's goin' down 
put it out for the world see 
me and x-men to the 10th degree 
everybody in the world to see 
when we melt down the acts with the weaponry 
it's goin' down
