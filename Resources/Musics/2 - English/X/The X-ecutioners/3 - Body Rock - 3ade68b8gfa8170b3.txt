BODY ROCK

Yo let me rock
Yo let me rock
Yo let me rock
Yo let me rock
Let me rock me rock me rock me rock
Rock rock rock rock rock rock rock
Ya got a taste for sin come in and move with me
Soak a kiss up against the authorities
Tragedy comes in a flyin height
Stay up all day stay up all night
Limp from a gittelin that might be fightin
Dive for ya chance like a bolt of lightnin
We came to bring a strain to the blood
Straight to the brain you affected cause
We gon die like dawn of the dead
Faces like zombies splitcha head
Frost thaw out and I see what ya thinkin
Its been a long say now whatcha drinkin

Nothin matters anymore
Right now we gon rush the floor
Bring it in cause we want more
Cmon everybody rock
So cmon everybody rock
Cmon make ya body rock
Cmon everybody rock
Rock rock rock rock rock
Cmon everybody rock
Cmon make ya body rock

Evrybody scream and shout
All em gangsters shoutin out
Blah blah blah ill type the rest
some other time just be patient
its harder than it looks to
Listen to a song and make out the words
