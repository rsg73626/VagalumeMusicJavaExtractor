LIKE THIS

As the 'X' kept fading, they were rockin' the crowd.
Everybody was movin' to the hypnotic sound.
They were cuttin' it up, scratchin' it with both hands.
They sounded so good they made everybody dance. (Check it out.)

[Scratching "I love this song" vocal.]

The music was hittin', the bass kept pumpin',
nobody was sittin', 'X' got the whole club jumpin'.

It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida
tearin' it up, yeah, flippin' the crossfader.

[Scratching "like this", "yeah" vocals.]

[Scratching "turn it up", "blow", "come on" vocals.]

By the end of the night, the whole vibe felt right,
yeah, the X-ecutioners made the music sound tight.

It was Rob Swift, Total Eclipse, Roc Raida
tearin' it up, yeah, flippin' the crossfader.
