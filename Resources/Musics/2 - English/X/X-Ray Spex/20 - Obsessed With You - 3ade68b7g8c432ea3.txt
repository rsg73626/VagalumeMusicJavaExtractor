OBSESSED WITH YOU

You are just a concept
You are just a dream
You're just a reflection
Of the new regime 

You are just a symbol
You are just theme
You're just another figure
For the sales machine 

Ooo ooo they're obsessed 
With yoo ooo 
Ooo ooo cos they're watching 
Yoo ooo 

You are just a victim
You are just a find 
Soon to be a casualty 
Of time
