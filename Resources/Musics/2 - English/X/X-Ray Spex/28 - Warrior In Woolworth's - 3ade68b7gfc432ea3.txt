WARRIOR IN WOOLWORTH'S

Warrior in Woolworth's 
Humble he may seem 
Behind his servile innocence
He plots and he schemes 

He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town 
He's the rebel on the underground 
She's the rebel of the modern town 

Warrior in Woolworth's 
His roots are in today 
Doesn't know no history 
He threw the past away 

Warrior in Woolworth's 
Dips on friday nights 
Youths meet at Stockwell Tube
Weapons rule their lives
