THE DAY THE WORLD TURNED DAY-GLO

I clambered over mounds and mounds
Of polystyrene foam 
And fell into a swimming pool 
Filled with fairy snow 
And watched the world turn day-glo
you know you know 
The world turned day-glo you know 

I wrenched the nylon curtains back 
As far as they would go 
And peered through perspex window panes 
At the acrylic road 

I drove my polypropolene 
Car on wheels of sponge 
Then pulled into a wimpy bar
To have a rubber bun 

The X-rays were penetrating
Through the laytex breeze 
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves 
The I fell from the rayon trees
