KITTEN

I like the way you walk
Just like a cat so smooth
You like to stalk me like your prey
Before you make your move
Your hair flies back with
your tail in the air
I see that look in your eyes, yeah
I love the way you purr
When I stroke your skin
You roll on the floor on your back
When the playing begins
Your hair flies back with your tail in the air
And that look in your eyes I'd recognise anywhere
Kitten
Let me play with you
Kitten. Ohhhhhhh
Like a kitten, kitten
Come on let me play with you. Ohhhhhh
Take me to your lair
Drop me down on the floor
You tease me with your tongue
Leave me begging for more
You're wanting my attention
When you've nothing else to do
Keep me up through the night
Just so that I'll play with you
You make me feel high, my feet float on air
I try to run away but I'm going nowhere
Your hair flies back with your tail in the air
And that look in your eyes I'd recognise anywhere
Kitten
Let me play with you
Kitten. Ohhhhhhh
Like a kitten, kitten
Come on let me play with you. Ohhhhhh
