STILL A CHILD

I remember when I was a kid
Always something going on
But a few years of being young
Then it's gone

I'm all grown up now
I'm an adult with responsibility
Yes I'm fully integrated into
This society

But as soon as I get home at night
I lock the door and stay here out of sight
Behind closed curtains I will hide
And keep this secret safely shut inside

Day ends and darkness drinks the light
I keep a candle burning through the night
Shadows fall and chill my beating heart
'Cause I'm still a child and I'm afraid of the dark


Lie in bed and hear the wind in the trees
Nothing seems to put my mind at ease
When I think that I have she'd my fears
A wave of panic burns between my ears
It's irrational but I don't think I'm insane
But terror creeps while I'm trying to sleep
'Till it's day again

Switch on my defenses, pull the blind
Still these visions are raging here in my mind
Shadows fall and chill my beating heart
'Cause I'm still a child and I'm afraid of the dark

Feel my life in the daylight tearing apart
'Cause I'm still a child and I'm afraid of the dark

I'm still a child and I'm afraid of the dark
