CRY OF THE INNOCENT

A cloak of evil shrouds you
Has been worn by you for years
Your happiness is misery
Your peals of joy are tears
You stalk the streets on blackest nights
Wake children from their sleep
Their dreaming ends in fright and fear
Their souls you hope to keep
But can you hear the suffering?
The pain which you unfurled?
Is this what you intended
When you were brought into the world?
Stand within the darkness
And look towards the light
And you will hear the innocents
Crying in the night
Cry
