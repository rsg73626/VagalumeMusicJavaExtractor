HEALER

What's been wrong with you lately?
You hover 'round like the ghost of a child
Hiding some unspoken pain
All these demons inside you
And in this life it can seem so confused
So much ventured nothing gained
Don't you say that it's over
Don't say you can't carry on
Take another step closer
I'll help you find where you belong
And your days will seem brighter
Brighter than neon which burns through the night
Burn these shadows from your mind
Let me lay down beside you
I'll hold you close in these hours of need
Help your passion to unwind
As the sunlight draws nearer
Here comes a brand new day
Cast your fears on the ocean
Let the tide take them away
And when you've let down your defences
You'll be mine
