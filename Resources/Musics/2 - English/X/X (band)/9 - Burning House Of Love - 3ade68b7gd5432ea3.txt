BURNING HOUSE OF LOVE

drive by my house late at night you can see it from from the freeway. no silhouette, but a light left on, burning there for love. smoke is rising from the fire, coming out my back door. i'm inside sound asleep, i see it on the floor. burning there for love. well, i can still remember a couple of years ago. when the smoke and flame from my name, there was a burning house of love. that rusty nail outside our door, is where i nailed our tears at rain. i threw that horseshoe in the weeds, and see what love could bring. now you're inside your big diamond lies, on either side of town. i think i might take a ride, and burn your love house down like a burning house of love
