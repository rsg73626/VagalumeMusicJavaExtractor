AROUND MY HEART

on the golden road... someone carved our initials in the stone. i dreamed of curly blackhair... when you were there. our first rendevous... was in the devil's workshop come true. this was dirty, dark no-place... for a beautiful face. so why do you want to throw another chain... around my heart? and even i was a winner... even was if it was for a little while. you cut me and smile. while my so-called friends... quickly turned into strangers. you're the one that i love. so why do you want to throw another chain... around my heart? you don't even know me... anyway, i'm all torn up from yesterday. so why do you want to throw another chain... around my heart? you don't even know me... anyway, i'm all screwed up from yesterday. so why do you want to throw another chain... around my heart? why do you want to throw another chain... around my heart?
