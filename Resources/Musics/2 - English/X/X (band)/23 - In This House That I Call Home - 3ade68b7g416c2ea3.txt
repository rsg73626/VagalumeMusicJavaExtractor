IN THIS HOUSE THAT I CALL HOME

a hundred lives are shoved inside guests arrive to dump their mess obedient host and visiting wife come outa the bedroom straightening clothes in this house that i call home nobody knows the party rules gotta get in but there's no room in this house that i call home beautiful walls are closing in looking at you you're having a nightmare stumble over tombstone shoes but it's too soon i finally look in your sweet eyes and somebody comes with a bottle of beer after he leaves i turn for a kiss and see the lady next door she's naked in the street
