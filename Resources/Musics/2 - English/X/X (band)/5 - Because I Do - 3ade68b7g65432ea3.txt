BECAUSE I DO

i am a black and white ghost in a black and invisible dress oh what a mess i'm in what kind of fool am i i am the married kind the kind that said i do forever searching for someone new at night i get drunk and fly around in the day i dream and lay around i drink and smoke your brand and drink i am drunk over you i am the married kind the kind that said i do forever searching for someone new i am the ghost of all my dreams to me it's all pretend i pretend i'm alive or just not dead i will die for you i am the married kind the kind that said i do forever searching for someone new my nights are numbered they don't count for nothing i'm not a fool, i'm just a bride and i'm just no good inside i am the married kind the kind that said i do forever searching for someone new
