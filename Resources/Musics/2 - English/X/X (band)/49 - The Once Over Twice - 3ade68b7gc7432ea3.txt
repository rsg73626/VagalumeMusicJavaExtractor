THE ONCE OVER TWICE

i just heard the sad song by another band sung by another man he gave me the once over twice i said when he said okay so long he hung me with the endless rope i could throw my lipstick and bracelets like gravel and move to alabama i got some more scotch instead then i died a thousand times he hung me with the endless rope then i died a thousand times maybe you don't but i do got a hole in my heart size of my heart size of my heart he hung me with the endless rope i'll see you and i'll raise you off the floor i'll floor you and we'll dance without a band i just heard the sad song hang another man he hung me with the endless rope
