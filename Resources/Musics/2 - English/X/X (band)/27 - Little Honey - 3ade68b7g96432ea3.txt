LITTLE HONEY

little honey, won't you come over here? little honey, we gotta get something clear. little honey, i promise i won't get mad, if you tell me about a boyfriend that you had. who lied last night... who made you mad... left you cryin' by the side of the road. left you cryin' to hitchhike home alone, all alone. little honey, are you goin' out tonight? little honey, i don't want to start a fight. little honey, if you don't answer me soon... you'll come home tomorrow to an empty room. with a light left on, the door open wide. window broken and pictures smashed, window broken and our bed covered in trash, all with trash. i ain't lookin' for fight... little honey, are you goin' out tonight? little honey, won't you please come over here? little honey, won't you please bring me a beer? little honey, i promise i won't get mad, if you tell me about a boyfriend that you had. 'cause you know i care, but what can i do? sit here waitin' by the side of the road, sit here waitin' till you come home alone, all alone. i ain't lookin' for fight... little honey, are you goin' out tonight?
