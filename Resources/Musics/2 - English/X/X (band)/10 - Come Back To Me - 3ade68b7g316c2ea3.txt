COME BACK TO ME

gifts and flowers lay upon the lid of pink silk above your face tears make a river of diamonds in the dark our daddy breaks down at the funeral home flies and relations make an annoying sound we sit or wander 'round the room ribbons are folded on the rose bouquets i hear a voice that sounds so much like yours please, please come back to me i cry and talk to you through the bathroom wall oh please, come back tp me playing in cleveland on a wednesday night recovering from the night before i'm broken and crying in the ladies room the opening band is banging out their song i built a shrine on the kitchen wall with flowers and florida souveniers you were walking through the house last night i knew it was you from the space in your steps
