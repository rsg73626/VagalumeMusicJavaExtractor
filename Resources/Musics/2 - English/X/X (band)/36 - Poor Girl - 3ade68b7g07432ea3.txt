POOR GIRL

you sat at home the windows tinted black it hits you hard and you cried so long life turned & wandered never to come back again takes what she gives you don't feel sorry for her when you fell out of the starlight inn you were too hurt to walk to bad to begin i looked at the sign but i couldnt feel sad for you takes what she gives you don't cry when you kiss her poor little girl ran away from home i try to explain why she wont say a thing sad sad thing im so far away now how can i say why she wont talk at all she holds the deck of cards she wants to be alone "ill be very ill and i tried waking up now i want to be alone" when you ran out of petes hotel you didnt look so good and you didnt feel so well "hold me tight" but i couldnt get it right takes what she gives you... poor little girl...she holds a deck of cards she wants to be alone she still drinks in the dark the radio is left on late she saw a madman fight and break it all cause she hated himself and she felt better off cause she was only drunk
