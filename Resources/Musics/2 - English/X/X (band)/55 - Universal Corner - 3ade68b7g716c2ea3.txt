UNIVERSAL CORNER

slip around some universal corner like a woman slip around some corner pick up the phone like a woman she must build a fire next to the pay phone heat is the point, smoke on the reciever light up to its universal ringing like a woman picking it up, her heat blinds the night and rises and rises she lets you in on her biggest secret like a woman she wants a man who knows all the right places like a woman washing his feet with her tears she'd dry them with her hair among the undefiled, she's gone wild her sins will sin from behind her like a woman dropping the phone she leaves it dead to the dead men the dead men screaming magdaline i'm so waiting, is there anyone so waiting screaming magdaline she is running
