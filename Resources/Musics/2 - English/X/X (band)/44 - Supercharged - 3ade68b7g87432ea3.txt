SUPERCHARGED

i went to see the sun at 6 o'clock... but i guess i stayed in bed too long. because it was night and that sun was goin' down. it was still awfully bright. he's bright and shiny as a brand new penny, and he's bad and hot as a hemie. i heard the skid when he arrived... so i slid to a stop at his feet. it was 6 o'clock on highway 5, so we stayed off the street. he's bright and shiny like a brand new penny, and he's bad and hot as a hemie. supercharged in my parking garage, he's big...he's bad...he's crazy. supercharged in my parking garage... supercharged in my parking garage. when we woke up the sun said 6 o'clock, so i guess we stayed in bed to long. 'cause it was night and that sun was goin' down. but it was still awfully bright. he's bright and shiny as a brand new penny, and he's bad and hot as a hemie. supercharged in my parking garage... he's so big...he's bad...so bad...so crazy. supercharged in my parking garage... supercharged in my parking garage... supercharged in my parking garage... he's so big...he's bad...bad...bad...bad..bad...so bad...he's crazy! supercharged in my parking garage... supercharged in my parking garage.
