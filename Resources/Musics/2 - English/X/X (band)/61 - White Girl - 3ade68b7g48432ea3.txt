WHITE GIRL

she's blonde she came along the sidewalk leave a trail of blue and black up to you fighting back steel chains a noose of charms on our necks i find nothing when we talk and sit blue heart passion and watch the set easy to fall part of your skull starts to break away a cheaters walk down the block behind this evil street she's a white girl i'm living with a white girl nineteen missing her man for an old girl drain every beer left over at home and listen to ghosts in the other room why not you're alone inside his keeping i'll replace your drunk old man sit in the parking lot and hold your hand easy to fall part of your skull starts to break away drugged and in love out at a club pulling me outside
