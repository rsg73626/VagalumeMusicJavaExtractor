ENDLESS RAIN

X Japan - Endless Rain


I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN
yuku ate mo naku kizutsuita karada nurashi
karamitsuku koori no zawameki
koroshi tsuzukete samayou itsu made mo
UNTIL I CAN FORGET YOUR LOVE

nemuri wa mayaku tohou ni kureta
kokoro o shizuka ni tokasu
mai agaru ai o odorasete
furueru karada o kioku no bara ni tsutsumu
I KEEP MY LOVE FOR YOU TO MYSELF

* ENDLESS RAIN, FALL ON MY HEART kokoro no kizu ni
LET ME FORGET ALL OF THE HATE, ALL OF THE SADNESS

Days of joy, days of sadness slowly pass me by
As I try to hold you, you are vanishing before me
You're just an illusion...
When I'm awaken, my tears have dried in the sand of sleep
I'm a rose blooming in the desert

IT'S A DREAM, I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU
madoromi dakishimete

[* repeat]

I AWAKE FROM MY DREAM
I CAN'T FIND MY WAY WITHOUT YOU

[guitar solo]

THE DREAM IS OVER
koe ni naranai kotoba o kurikaeshite mo
takasugiru hai iro no kabe wasugi satta hi no
omoi o yume ni utsusu
UNTIL I CAN FORGET YOUR LOVE

[* repeat]

ENDLESS RAIN, LET ME STAY EVER MORE IN YOUR HEART
LET MY HEART TAKE IN YOUR TEARS, TAKE IN YOUR MEMORIES

[* repeat]
