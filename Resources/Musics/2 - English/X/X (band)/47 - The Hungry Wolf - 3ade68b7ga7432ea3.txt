THE HUNGRY WOLF

i am the hungry wolf and run endlessly with my mate i see the gutter feed on the foolish outrun and kill the strong at daybreak i roam awake to who follows me i roam i roam i am the hungry wolf and run endlessly with my mate welcome to the dripping jaws the alter of your death at daybreak i roam ready to tear up the world i roam i roam the hungry wolf stares from the hill at the villagers around the fire she loves her mate as he loves her and they live together for life i am the hungry wolf and run endlessly with my mate look across the street, my friend we're waiting for you to slow down at daybreak i roam eyes in the back of my head i roam i roam
