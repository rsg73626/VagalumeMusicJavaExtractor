MY GOODNESS

my goodness... just left to make room for you. oh, my goodness... sure knows what it wants to do. my goodness...i go bad at the drop of a heart. my goodness always stops when my trouble starts. ain't nothing bad about me... i got all my feeling tamed. i've been a faithful, honest woman, and he knows my love won't change. but none of you have seen my as this past of mine stops by, in the form of a handsome stranger i've loved since '75. my goodness... just left to make room for you. oh, my goodness... sure knows what it wants to do. my goodness...i go bad at the drop of a heart. my goodness always stops when my trouble starts. my goodness is strong, and it's stronger laying down. he's only here to love me and he'll leave this town. very bad thoughts i'm thinkin' today, i can't keep my mind out of the gutter, not even to save my soul. i take a drink and lose control. you buy a bottle 'round my door, she goes out the window. my goodness...
