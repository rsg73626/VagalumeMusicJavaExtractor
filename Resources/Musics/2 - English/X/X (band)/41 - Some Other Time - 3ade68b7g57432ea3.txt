SOME OTHER TIME

let's not talk about bombs and the impulses severed limbs you will always subtract your arms from my arms someone always interupts us while we talk so i'm gonna draw this evening's line before my wash hangs on it for everyone to see it's very bad luck to draw the line on the night before the worlds ends we can draw the line some other time this midnight i will turn into a beer i will dream of you between nightmares and wars and toss and turn ain't you gonna take me for a ride drink and drive down to the l.a. river bed i'll make no mistakes and i'll behave
