SOUL KITCHEN

well, the clock says it's time to close now i guess i'd better go now i'd really like to stay here all night the cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes street lights share their hollow glow your brain seems bruised with numb surprise still one place to go still one place to go let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen warm my mind near your gentle stove turn me out and i'll wander, baby stumbling in the neon groves your fingers weave quick minarets speak in secret alphabets you light another cigarette learn to forget, learn to forget learn to forget, learn to forget
