CS

So what the fuck is up now

You wanna see me crawl
I wont bow to your knee's
Listin here you motherfucker
I am your plague, your disease

Your on my level now
I would love to see you try and get through
Me, we are everything you have ever wanted
To be, you cant win this game without a clue,
Run your mouth and we will ripp through you

Your on my level now
A million risen suns, will never brighten up your days
forever, casting a shade
