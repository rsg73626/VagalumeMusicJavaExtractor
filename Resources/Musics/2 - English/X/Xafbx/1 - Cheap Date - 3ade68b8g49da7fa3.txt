CHEAP DATE

You’re just a cheap date
There’s nothing left to say when
Your innocence is forever gone
plagued our scene with filth and
STD’S

Cheap turns too slut, know that you
Did this to your self
You’re just a bitch in every way there
Is and for the record your make up
Looks like shit

What now? With out your scene
You’re just another face in my crowd
Your dead inside, your painted looks
Can’t hide the filth that eats you away
You’re just a cheap date!
The cheapest they get
One..Two..Three..WHORE!!

Cheap date, you gave good girls a
bad name
