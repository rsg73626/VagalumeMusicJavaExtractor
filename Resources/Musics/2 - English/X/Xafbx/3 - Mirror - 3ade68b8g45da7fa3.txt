MIRROR

This is real
I am my own enemy
I am my own enemy in this game called
Life as we speak, This is the turning point
Of our lives
The one chance we have, we will
Never have again
Not even addiction can tie me down
My silence, never hit your ground
With your new piece of mind its
Time to get your shit straight, take charge
Of your ship
I've lost so much to get so far in this
Game called life as we strive to
Succeed without filth and
Greed, I am my own enemy
