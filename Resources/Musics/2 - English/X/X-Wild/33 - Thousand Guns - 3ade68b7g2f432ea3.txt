THOUSAND GUNS

He stepped into the bar and looked around
Didn't like much what he saw and what he found
Too many faces with an attitude
Too many dudes that were do uncool
Y'hear what I'm saying, hombre
Yeah, you too, mister
Son of a bitch

Hey, you over there, with the scar on your face
I don't think you're part of the fucking human race
You're like something I goddamn stepped on before
And I'm the bad guy, come to settle the score

It ain't black it ain't white
I just come for the big fight
And I'm your worst nightmare
And I'm as deadly as a snake
Can't you see it in my eyes
And I'm packin' a few surprises
I'm the man with a thousand, with a thousand guns

I'm gonna do ya
Like a dead dog down
I'm gonna shoot ya
With a thousand guns

I'm so fast, my aim
Is true, here's looking at you
Right between the eyes
I'm so fast, took you by surprise
Got a Colt 45
I am the desperado
I'm the man with a thousand, with a thousand guns

I'm a killer on the loose
I shoot from the hip, no lip
Got a pair of blooded hounds
And they're straining for the kill
I am the judge and jury
I am the executioner
I'm the man with a thousand, with a thousand guns
