FREEWAY DEVIL

Fear of the devil, that's kept me alive
Now I have to answer, 'cause God's not on my side
I rode to Montana and California, too
Down to Arizona, yeah, yeah, that's where I met you
I hit the road, Chicago, It's time to meet the pack
I went down that other road, I ain't coming back
Kicked off at Detroit to meet the Brothers Grim
We went down in brotherhood, we're nwver giving in

We are the freeway devils, freeway devils

My bike's a temple and now I'm kicking ass
If you're looking for trouble yeah, yeah, yeah,
You'll find a heart attack
The sheriff came, pulled out his gun
" You betta get outa town & quot;
He read me the riot act, the dirty motherfuck
Gave me the third degree and now I'm outta luck

I ride with the devil, I ride with the wind
Nothing's gonna stop me
From riding to be free
40 days I was in the slam, 200 dollars light
I got myself an enemy, I got into a terrible fight
I got cut to pieces, yeah, but I'm an animal-mal
You should have seen the other guy
They put him straight in the can
They locked me up, threw away the key
They kicked my bike to shit
I'm never gonna get outa here, but I'm never givin' in

It's alright, it's alright
I'm a freeway devil and I'm feeling alright
It's alright, it's alright
I'm a freeway devil and I'm feeling alright

I want to be free and I'm free, I know I'm free
Just gotta be free, you know itÃƒs easy to be free
And I'm goddamn free
