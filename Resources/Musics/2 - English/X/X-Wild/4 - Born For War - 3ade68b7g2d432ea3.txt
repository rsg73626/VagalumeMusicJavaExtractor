BORN FOR WAR

(The Duke, half brother of the dead king siezes his chance
to destroy all who stand in his way, and crown himself king!)

Start up the engines
Release my dogs of war
Pump up the bloodlust
The heavens will be torn
Be blinded by my fury
With no mercy shown
The cut and thrust
Raw energy
Know my word is law

Send in my armies
My black chohorts
Send in my legions
And glory will be yours

My church has no religion
No need for sanity
I am the lord and master
Of all that i do see

Send in my armies
My black chohorts
Send in my legions
And glory will be yours

Hail the Duke
We are yours
Hail the Duke
Born for war

So raise the banners
Blood is on the sword
Axes cleave into the skulls
Kllings my reward
Braveheart cant deny me
I am the rightful lord
We have to find the dragon "Moroth"
And put him to the sword

Send in my armies
Sy black chohorts
Send in my legions
And glory will be yours

Onward my soliders
We have them on the run
The shout and screams of battle
"Meine G½tterdÆmmerung"
In my name apocalypse
And atrocity
Before my throne of silvered stone
The vanquished
On their knees

Send in my armies
Sy black chohorts
Send in my legions
And glory will be yours
