WILD FRONTIER

We're the people of the plains
We're the true Americans
Here we live and here we die
Our land
Come and face us, yellow hair
See our feathered pride
See how the red man stands
See how we die

Painted faces, battlecries
Watch out, white man, time to die
Painted faces, battlecries
Today you die

No more hunger, no more strife
No more fear, it's time to fight
No more running, time to stand
Life is precious, life is land

Fire and smoke rise in the sky
Our brothers come, their women cry
Eager young warriors sharpen their knives
The dance of death, fire in their eyes

[Spoken:]
And all the nations shall gather, from the Black Hills to the mighty
rivers: Sioux, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, Shoshone, Cree, Cherokee,
Many warriors for the final battle

We shall overcome
We shall finally be free
We shall crush the white man
We shall regain our lands
