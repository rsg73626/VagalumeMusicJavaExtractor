SCARRED TO THE BONE

I want to tell you a story
About a man who did die
And all he wanted from living
Was the chance to get high
So he set out to driving
To do his dealing and score
Well, he climbed up that mountain
Yeah, yeah, ha had to have more

He had to get high

Next step up the ladder
Was a needle so fine
Just a crack-headed buster
What better reason to fly
He had a wife and some children
And a Cadillac too
He's got his head down that spiral
There's nothing that we can do

He had to get high
So high
Let's get high

[Chorus:]
He's lying alone in the gutter at night
No friends to help him, nobody in sight
Done all his talking to angels alone
No hope in this life
When you're scarred to the bone

Y'know there's no death or glory
When you're riding the wind
Just the crash and explosion
Of your head giving in
Turning left at damnation
Turning right at the fire
In your veins there's a burning
For your quest to get high

He had to get high
So high
Let's get high
