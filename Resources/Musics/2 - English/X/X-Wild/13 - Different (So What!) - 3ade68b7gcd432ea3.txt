DIFFERENT (SO WHAT!)

So what, if he's different?

Don't - you're not the one to tell me how
The way I look at people now
He is a brother of the skin
And this is how we will begin
We'll fight the ugliness of lies
Covering eyes that do despise
Under nations, one and all
We'll fight the bigots once for all
The tempest starts to come alive
How is it, that you are so blind?
So don't despair, you Rodney Kings

Hate, kill, different, so what?

It's only men who destroy souls
Under the banner of the right
You wannt to crush, you want to fight
But let me tell you now, my son
In the end you'll be undone
The politicians think they're cute
Another kike, another jew
Another nigger, wop and spick
The terminology of the sick

We can all be brothers
We are all God's children
We can be under the sun, together

Don't - you're not the one to tell me how
The way I look at people now
We are the brothers of the skin
And this is how we will begin
We'll fight the ugliness of lies
Cover eyes that do despise
Under nations, one and all
