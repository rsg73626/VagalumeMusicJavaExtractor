THEATRE OF BLOOD

Welcome my brothers, to this midnight show
The price of entrance, is the ticket to your soul
It's a special showing, especially for you
Roll up, roll up and you can join our mystery
We are the reapers, now yor're answering to me
In your direction, I give a royal bow
The curtain's up, too late lo let you out

So, here you are
In the theater of blood
Nothing protects you
In the theatre of blood

We have the keys to open up your heart
To look inside and taste the fear within
If you're a sinner, I hope you'll stand the heat
You have to pay the wages of your sins

So, here you are
In the theater of blood
Nothing protects you
In the theatre of blood
