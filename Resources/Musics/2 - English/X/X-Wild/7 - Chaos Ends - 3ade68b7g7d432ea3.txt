CHAOS ENDS

(The lifting of the darkness, the freeing of Moroth,
to roam free over Savageland, and the crowning of the new king Braveheart.)

At last the day has come, now we are free
The last battles fought so now we take our leave
The bells ring out across the land so loud
For on this day a new king has been crowned

We think of those we left behind
We know a new day has arrived

We shout, we scream, we laugh -
Savageland is free
New day, new start, new life -
Savageland is free

Across the sky the sun begins her climb
Eyes open wide we see the darkness die
And in the heavens a blinding shaft of light
It kisses Moroth in his freedom flight

We think og those we left behind
We know a new day has arrived

The Duke is dead, his hatred and his greed
Is in the past, a brave new world indeed
And in our dreams this day it had to come
With hands on heart a new life has begun

We think of those we left behind We know a new day has arrived
