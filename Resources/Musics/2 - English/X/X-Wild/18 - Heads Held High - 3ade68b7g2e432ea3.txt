HEADS HELD HIGH

We've been done for metal
We got metal in our veins - hands held high
Got mayhem in our hearts
An it's tearing us apart - heads held high
We love the feel of leather
The coldness of the steel - hands held high
We are the metal warriors
Not seventh sons of whores - heads held high

We live our lives on energy
We've learned to take the pain - hands held high
Within denim, lace and dignity
We shout our name with pride - heads held high
We've got passion that's on overload
Our faith will never die - hands held high
So we scream it out for liberty
With fists up to the sky - heads held high

We are on a mission, A mission from god

We are army an true and strong
Our ranks will never break - hands held high
Our voices rend the universe
So loyal that it aches - heads held high
In legenday brotherhood
Just doing as we please - hands held high
They try so hard to bring us down
But never to our knees - heads held high

We'll fight our way through thick and thin
To hear the metal call - hands held high
No power on earth stands over us
That's why we stand so tall - heads held high
For those of you who do not hear
This sacred call within - hands held high
For sanity and metal's sake
This battle we will win - heads held high
