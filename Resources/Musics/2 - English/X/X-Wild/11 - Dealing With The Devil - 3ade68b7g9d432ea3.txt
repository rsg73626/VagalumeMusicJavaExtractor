DEALING WITH THE DEVIL

I am the keeper, soul, heart stealer
I'll put a spell, a spell on you - voodoo
Dog's dinner, such a winner
I'll steal your life away
Black eyes, gambling your life

Hands down, a winning round
I've got the cards stacked high
You're dealing with the devil, that's no lie
No fear, the bad man's here
Yes, I'm your bogey man
I've got the power to survive

Hey, hey, dealing with the devil - I say
Hey, hey, you will be looser of the day

No time to fool around
Yeah, you're coming with me
It's time to lay your money down
Ace high, diamonds low
The spades are in my hands
You've been dealing with the devil
And you're mine

Just throw the cards down
You're coming with me, Jack!
