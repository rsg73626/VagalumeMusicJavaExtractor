SAVAGELAND (INTRO)

[Orater:]
Come, open your inner eye and together we'll haul back the mystery
that is time, and peer through the mist and take a closer look at the
darkened valleys under a whirlpool sky, bathed by a cold blue sun,
a place that is called - Savageland.

[Running Man:]
"Sire, Sire - What is happening to our world?"

[Orater:]
On horseback, buckled and gleaming for war,
he eyed the old man - and with sorrow in his heart - spoke.

[Braveheart:]
"The sun has set in Savageland, the Sun has set!"
