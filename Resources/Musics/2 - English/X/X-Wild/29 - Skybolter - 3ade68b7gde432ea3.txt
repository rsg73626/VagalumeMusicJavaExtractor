SKYBOLTER

Don't anger the gods
You might find yourself in the grave
The strongest of strong
All have been put to the blade
The great and the noble
Princes and kings
The power-mad rulers
Who'd thought they'd win

He drew his sword from the side
His anger was mighty
Mercy was nowhere in sight
The heavens are opened
The thunder it rings
He's riding the lightning
And the howling winds

I am the sky, skybolter, skybolter, sky
Skybolter
Die by the sky, skybolter, skybolter, sky
Skybolter

When Odin is angry
Earth will tremble and shake
Mountains will fall
Rivers will burn, it's too late
I come from Valhalla
With ice in my bones
I'm raising my hammer
You shall fall
