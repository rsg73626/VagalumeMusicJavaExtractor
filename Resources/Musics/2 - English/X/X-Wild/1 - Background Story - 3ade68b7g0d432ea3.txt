BACKGROUND STORY

Savageland, another time, another world, where under a cold blue sun, the
evil Duke Kron, half brother of the murdered ruler of Savageland, seeks to
deny the rightful heir - Braveheart, his destiny.

Duke Kron cannot do this until he has found and extinguished the mythical
dragon Moroth, who guards the Shield of Darkness (a force for good or evil
to whom whoever posseses it).

The Duke must keep Braveheart from finding the shield. He therefore sets
out to destroy Braveheart and all men of good heart by using his dark
legions of damned souls, all what have been put under the spell of the Blue
Flame, which the Duke keeps burning by the rare ore that is dug by the
slave children in the underground mines. As events unfold Elenor,
Braveheart's daughter, is accidently killed by himself, while trying to
summon mystic forces against the Duke.

Braveheart, swears vengeance! The Duke must be stopped!
To save SAVAGELAND!
