KID RACER

Check it out boys, bet a load of these wheels
The colour is red, fast as it feels
400 Horses and 48 valves
A shit-kickin' mutha, burning tires
Kid racer
Hell raiser

Suck up the gas, foot to the floor
Engine is screaming, I gotta have more
It's people like you, I don't wanna be
Hey you over there, why are you looking at me?
Oh God

There's a devil in me, likes to race fast
Heaven knows, I know it won't last
And I don't care
Out of the fat and into the fire
Here comes the wall, I'm gonna get fried
Nobody cares what happens to me
And I don't care - I've been living free

You are I and I'm like you
And the man don't give a damn
We won't change, it's us that dies
And the man don't give a damn

Who cares? not me!
