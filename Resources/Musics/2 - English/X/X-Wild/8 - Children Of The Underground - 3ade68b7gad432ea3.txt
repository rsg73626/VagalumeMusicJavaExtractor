CHILDREN OF THE UNDERGROUND

(The horror of the underground mines, where the captured children are
forced to work to extract the ore the Duke needs for his magic fire!)

White as snow
Eyes that fear the light
Pale and drawn
Children of the Underground

Dark and dank
Keepers of the light
Down they sank
Children of the Underground

Whipped and chained
Pain and death abound
In the mines
Children of the Underground

Heartless beasts
Urging on for more
Keep the magic flame
Burning bright for evermore

For heavens sake
We must not let them fall
We have to fight
The evil that men do
A cry goes up
Dear Braveheart save our souls
Release us from this penance
Oh so cruel
