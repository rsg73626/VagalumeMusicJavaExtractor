DR. SARDONICUS

I stand alone in my tower in the sky
With my creations always at my side
The many-headed, deformities of limb
I watch them dreaming of a life I cannot give

I tried to give the life
But  I always failed
These are the creatures
Of what wizardy made
They'll break the chains
That's my only hold
These are the people
Who won't do what they're told

Dr. Sardonicus - Won't you please set us free
Dr. Sardonicus - It's no life that we lead
Dr. Sardonicus - You promised us life
Dr. Sardonicus - Was it all just a lie

I feel the terror and it cuts like a knife
The staring eyes in the quivering light
Closer and closer, they start to mover in
To necromance my essence from within

I tried to give them life
But  I always failed
These are the creatures
Of what wizardy made
They'll break the chains
That's my only hold
These are the people
Who won't do what they're told

Dr. Sardonicus - Won't you please set us free
Dr. Sardonicus - It's no life that we lead
Dr. Sardonicus - You promised us life
Dr. Sardonicus - Was it all just a lie
