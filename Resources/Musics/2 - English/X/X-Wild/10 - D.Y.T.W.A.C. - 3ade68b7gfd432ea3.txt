D.Y.T.W.A.C.

One day the Prince will come
And light the night
He will rule over us
And restore our sight
Nothing of evil remains
Blinded by his light

How long have we been waited
Waited for the man to come
Do you think we are crazy?

Is he the Saviour we know
Or is he just a dream
Another madman playing a game
We'll have to shout out our screams

You're telling me that you know that you're right
I'm telling you you're wrong
Are you the son of a preacher man?
Always singing this song
You look at me and you ask me why
I'm telling you no lies
If you want to hear the truth
You'd better open your eyes
