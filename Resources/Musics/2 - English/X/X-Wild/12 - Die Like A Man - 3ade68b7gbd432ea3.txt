DIE LIKE A MAN

(The gathering of Braveheart's forces against the Duke's dark legions...)

As the north wind howled
And the thunder broke, Braveheart
Stands proudly before his troops
And thrusting his sword toward
Heaven, shouts at the darkening sky,
"Now, its time to die like a man!"

The horn it has blown, we brothers in arms
Stand like a rock to the wind
Iron for blood, thousands are stood
Men with true hearts, they will win
Marching towards, not for glory or gold
Ready to die like a man
Archers and riders, are all poised for war
Ready to die like a man
Die like a man

Each man is ready, boiling with rage
Anger is home to revenge
Destroyers of dreams, they shall not succeed
Surrender's no part of the plan
Turn back the tide, of the ones with blind eyes
Ready to die like a man
Lets all heed the call, take the beast by the throat
Ready to die like a man
Die like man

To the beat of the drums and our backs to the sun
Our shields are all burnished and bright
The camp fires ebb, the gauntlet is down
Our tears, no sorrow for the vanguard of truth
Ready to die like a man
As the moon it gives way, for the cool of the dawn
Ready to die like a man
Die like a man

The trumpets are blown, so foreward we go
We're ready to dike like a man
Shields at the ready, our sinews are taut
Ready to die like a man
Die like a man
