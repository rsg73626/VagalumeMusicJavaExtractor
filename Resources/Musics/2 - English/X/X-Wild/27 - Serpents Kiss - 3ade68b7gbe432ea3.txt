SERPENTS KISS

She moved a little closer
She was hypnotizing him
Had him in her power
He's desperate to break free
Nowhere to run
And there was nowhere to hide
The serpent's kiss is deadly
It turns your heart to ice

Here she comes, once again
Terror in my face

I gotta get, outta here
From her killing embrace

She's got a serpent's kiss
And she will never miss

Just like a spider
That weaves you in its web
He is the dinner
On the sacrificial bed
The tounge's so sweet
Asit coils around his neck
A taste of heaven
As she empties out his head

Here she comes, once again
Terror in my face

I gotta get, out of here
From her killing embrace
