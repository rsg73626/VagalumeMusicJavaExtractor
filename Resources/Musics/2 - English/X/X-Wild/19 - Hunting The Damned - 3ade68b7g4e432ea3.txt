HUNTING THE DAMNED

(The putting to death to the twisted souls
the Duke had changed with his evil power.)

In the caves, slaves in chains, no release,
From the Duke and his power
Haunting sight, mesmerized, bastardized,
Get ready the pyres
Staring eyes, victimized, hypnotized
All out of their minds
Find the all, hark the call, till their souls
Are cleansed by our fire

Hopeless ones, they were wronged, it's to be,
A murdering night
Quell the pain, the mad insane, you know they feel
No wrong and no right
Steel your heart, to tear apart, devils work
No mercy for life
Pleading hads, let nothing stand, hunt them down,
Grind their ashes to dust

Can't you see, it has to bee, to scour the land,
To rid our world, of the scourge, of the damned,
We're hunting the damned

We will never be the same, we are all,
Hunting the damned
We shall carry alll the sham, we are all
Hunting the damned

They once were men, they were free, they were cahnged,
Now no better than dogs
From one poor soul, a name is called, he's recognized,
His body all torn
In the pit, the flames caress, his memories
Of a life before
Reaching out, he tries to stand, a human torch
His life at an end

Can't you see, it has to bee, to scour the land,
To rid our world, of the scourge, of the damned,
We're hunting the damned
