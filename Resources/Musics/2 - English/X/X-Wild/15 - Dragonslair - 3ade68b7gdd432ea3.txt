DRAGONSLAIR

(The fighting and finally befriending of the mythical but very real dragon
Moroth. Ending in the showing by Moroth to Braveheart the power of the
Shield of Darkness and the foretelling of his coming to rule Savageland)

The wind and rain were allies
Fought the sweat upon his brow
And hunger was an enemy
The fear it stalked the ground
He gazed up at the mountain
To the dragonslair he crawled
And clutched his mighty hammer
To his breast that was so cold

In dragonslair
All alone in dragonslair
Im so alone
Alone in dragonslair

So heavy was his breathing
Remembering the myth
How mighty was the dragon
And Moroth he was called
The guardian of the shield
Of darkness was his role
And suddenly he saw the beast
How could he be so bold

Awakened from his slumber
Moroth spied him with one eye
Unfurled his wings with gaping mouth
A million teeth shone bright
Down and down he circled
So silent in his flight
The clash of steel on scaly skin
Resounded in the night

As Moroth saw the pendant
Around our heroes neck
A memory great eons old
Flashed suddenly in his head
"Reveal the Shield of Darkness"
The old ones they had told
To he who is the true one
And serve him in his quest
