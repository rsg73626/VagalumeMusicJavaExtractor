FIELD OF BLACKBIRDS

(The aftermath of the battle, the tears and the sadness!)

In the fields a blackbird cries
And another star has died
Mothers wail and search for sons
Brothers and the child

Do you see through
The mist and rain
The mourners
Have arrived

In the field of blackbirds
See our tears collide
In the field of blackbirds
They all cry

Will the dawn and the morning sun
Come and bathe us in her light
Hear the beat of a heavy drum
As another flower dies

Do you see through
The mist and rain
The evidence
Of lies

Through the eyes of a child
See the crosses of white
Watch a silent display
Field of blackbirds parade
Was it all in our minds
Was the reason so right
Did they all have to die
Field of blackbirds parade

And in the field a blackbird cries
Echoing a dying rose
Someone stands and makes his mark
On a grave with a broken heart
