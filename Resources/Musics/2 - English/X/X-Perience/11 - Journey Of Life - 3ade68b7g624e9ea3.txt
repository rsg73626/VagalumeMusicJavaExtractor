JOURNEY OF LIFE

a journey takes a lifetime 
every single day goes by 
we're on a trip with no time 
to rest before we're old and die 
and our life is like a river 
is like river of no return 

the journey of life is a trip to the sky 
it starts when you're born 
and it ends when you die 
it takes just a lifetime to get to the end 
the journey of life is about to begin 
the journey of life is a trip to the sky 
it takes you from heaven to hell and to sin 
the journey of life is about to begin 

we're riding on a road to nowhere 
life is a one way ticket, babe 
so hurry, i'll take you with me 
life is a long trip worth to take 
and our life is like a river 
is like river ofn o return
