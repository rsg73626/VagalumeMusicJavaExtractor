Y2K01
The year of our return into the light
We gonna leave the bad days far behind
Come with me and you will see
The future is our place to be
Come with me and you will see

Y2K01 Y2K01 Y2K01
We'll come back to you
And you will see
We'll burn all the bridges we have crossed
We'll make a new start
A ride to the stars

Come with me and you will see
The future is our place to be
Come with me and you will see

X-P is the family
The rhythm and groove and melody
The music made for the next decade
Just follow us 'cause we can't wait
