MOONLIGHT SHADOW

(By a moonlight shadow, moonlight shadow, ...)

The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

Lost in a riddle
That saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

All she saw
Was the silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day
(one day ...)

Four A.M. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

Star was light
In a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
And she couldn't find how to push through

Lost in a riddle
That saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through
