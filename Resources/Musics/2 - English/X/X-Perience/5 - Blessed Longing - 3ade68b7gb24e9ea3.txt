BLESSED LONGING

tell it only to the wise 
for the crowd at once will jeer 
that which is alive i praise 
that which longs for death by fire 

cooled by passionate love at night 
procreated, procreating 
you have known the alien feeling 
in the calm of candlelight 

gloom embraced will lie no more 
by the flickering shades obscured 
but are seized by new desire 
to higher union lured 

then no distance holds you fast 
winged, enchanted, on you fly 
light your longing, and at least 
moth, you meet the flame and die 

never prompted to that quest 
die and dare rebirth 
you remain a dreary guest 
on our gloomy earth
