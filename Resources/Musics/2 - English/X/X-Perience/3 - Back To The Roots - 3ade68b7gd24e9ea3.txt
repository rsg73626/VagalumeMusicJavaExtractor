BACK TO THE ROOTS

e-mails from outer space 
bytes and bit s
are on the race 
to the moon and return 
the light of mankind will burn 

back to the roots 
the place where we are born 
right where the crown of creation comes from 
back to the roots 
to the beauty of youth 
we are going back 
to make a new start 

world wide web - mtv rule the days 
i am going to be 
slave to screens - to machines 
living in electrocity 

humankind on the run 
we donÂ´t care about what we have done 
neon light night and day 
time is ticking away
