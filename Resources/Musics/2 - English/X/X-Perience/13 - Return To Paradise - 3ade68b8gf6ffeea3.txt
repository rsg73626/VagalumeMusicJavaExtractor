RETURN TO PARADISE

i walk on the water, oh she's so funny
her taste on my lips, like milk and honey
i see crystal lights, i want to stay forever

i want to stay, i dive in oxygen
now and today, i throw away my pain,
i want to stay, i'm gonna live today, forever...

the return to paradise,
it's all so nice
beautiful
i will dive into the light
i'm glad to be in love

the return to paradise,
it's all so nice
beautiful
i will dive into the light
i'm glad to be in love

so deep so endlessly
so nice and hopefully
she gives the kiss of life to me

i want to seek the sea, the liquid skies
the warm and tender lights, when days arise
i want to feel surreal, i want to stay, forever

i want to stay, i dive in oxygen
now and today, i throw away my pain,
i want to stay, i'm gonna live today, forever...

the return to paradise,
it's all so nice
beautiful
i will dive into the light
i'm glad to be in love

...

so deep so endlessly
so nice and hopefully
she gives the kiss of life to me

the return to paradise,
it's all so nice
beautiful
i will dive into the light
i'm glad to be in love

the return to paradise,
it's all so nice
beautiful
i will dive into the light
i'm glad to be in love
