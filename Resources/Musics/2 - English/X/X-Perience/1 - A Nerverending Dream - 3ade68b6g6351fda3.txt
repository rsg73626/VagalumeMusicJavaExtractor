A NERVERENDING DREAM

I am waiting for the night
drifting away
on the waves of my dreams
to another day
i am standing on the hill
and beyond the clouds
the wind is blowing still
and catching my doubts

A neverending dream
a dream of you
i believe i receive
a sign of you
tonite i wanna hide my feelings too

I am hunting all the night
the slave to my dream
an illustrated scene
ascends in the steam
We're playing full of vice
our emotional game
IÂ´m turning off my eyes
for hiding my shame

I am watching all the flowers
dying away
in heated breath of live
at the dawning day
I am waking up in spring
