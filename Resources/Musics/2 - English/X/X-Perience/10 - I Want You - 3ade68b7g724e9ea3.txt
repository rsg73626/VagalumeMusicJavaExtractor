I WANT YOU

I want you to want me
for all that I am
I will always praise you again and again
I want you to love me for all that I am
I won't ever leave you
I'll do all I can
for you

You are a damn good-looking man
you are the one to survive
the crown of creation we are still alive
I hang on to your words believing
whenever you say
no hate and no harm will come my way

I want you to want me
for all that I am
I will always praise you again and again
I want you to love me for all that I am
I won't ever leave you
I'll do all I can
for you

You are the one to take me home
I turn my face to the sun
you never would go and leave the needies Alone
I keep the faith of being sheltered
wherever I pray
no hate and no harm will come my way

I want you to want me
for all that I am
I will always praise you again and again
I want you to love me for all that I am
I won't ever leave you
I'll do all I can
for you
