HIS LIFE

woke up in the morning 
and it made him upset 
all his cares deep inside 
living nightmares in his head 

thistles and thorn on my head 
confidence as a shame 
this life's sfear and despair 
no more than disasters 
no more than fales my dear 

he hang around felt sad 
couldn't climb the wall alone 
dreamed of fellow man and help 
but he know they were gone 

he realize the things 
surrounding his mind are useless 
in fall of life 
all the things he couldn't find 
try to cover, try to hide 
he try to cover, he try to hide
