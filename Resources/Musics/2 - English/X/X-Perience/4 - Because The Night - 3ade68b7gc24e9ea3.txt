BECAUSE THE NIGHT

don't you know 
what i feel babe 
you put your magic hands on the wheel 
when you're driving the car 
i will kiss you as far 
as fallen angels do that 
all the night 

take my hands off the wheel 
doing 215 
close my eyes, count to 5 
and we are still alive now 

i can't get you out of my mind 
and i know that my dreams come true 
i can't take my hand of you, babe 
and i am feeling so blue without you 

and i switch off the light 
a quarter to midnight 
leave the road to a field 
taking awild ride 

better look back if you run away 
from me my friend tonight 
i would do anything to let you know 
you can hold me tight, all the night 
don't you know
