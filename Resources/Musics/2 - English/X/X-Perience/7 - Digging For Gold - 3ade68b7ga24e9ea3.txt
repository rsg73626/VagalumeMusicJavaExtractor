DIGGING FOR GOLD

digging for gold 
i wanna hold the sunshine 
in my hand 
right in my hand 

go ym way 
please donÂ´r stay in bed 
it is hard to get 
up in the morning 
when the rain falls 
you see the 
morning light 
and when the sun shines bright 
after a long dark night 
the day will be alright - you know 

digging for gold 
i wanna hold the sunshine 
in my hand 
right in my hand 

go my way 
please donÂ´t go away 
and cover me 
get to the point, every morning 
every evening, every night 
and when the sun shines bright 
after a long dark night 
the day will be alright - you know
