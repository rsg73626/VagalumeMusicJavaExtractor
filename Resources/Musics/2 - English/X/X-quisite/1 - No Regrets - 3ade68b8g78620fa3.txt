NO REGRETS

you just came out the door
too bad i can't see your face no more
found the letter on the sheets
that read you don't wanna be with me
tears ran down my face
as lonleyness took your place
took away the pain a bit on my tounge
never thought i'd be alone soo young

chorous-:
what you see is what you get
still i have no regrets
what you get is what you see
can't make you wanna be wit me
though i can't get about you yet
still i have no regrets
what you get is what you see
gotta want me for me

And....
everythang's down the stairs
now i found my heart soo scared
realize what this could
all of what has become of me
though you ain't wait for me ta say
you're better of without me anyway
althoughmy brand new life has begun
still i never thought this day would come

(Chourous)

lookin out the window i
remember all those lonley nights
they're no longer filled with fear
im doin fine although you CAN'T BE HERE

(Chourous)

ha ha....
ha ha....
ha ha....
hmm....
