I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER

It's a love plan
I wanna be your lover
I gotta make you look into my eyes
It's a love plan
I wanna be your lover
I gotta make you look into my eyes

It's a love plan
(look into my eyes)
It's a love plan
I wanna be your lover

So come on closer
A roller coaster
You take me up and dance
You take me up in the night
I say forever
And never
It's up this once again
You'll never got me no way

It's a love plan
I wanna be your lover
