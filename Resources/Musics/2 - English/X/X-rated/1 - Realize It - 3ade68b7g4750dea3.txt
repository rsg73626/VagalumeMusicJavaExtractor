REALIZE IT

Move

Stop to act this way
And start to turn the tide
I wanna feel live, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna feel alive

All you have to do
So you gotta realize

I have to think it’s something inside
So I will play my part
You’ve gotta get straight
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna feel alive

All you have to do
So you gotta realize

Screaming in the dead of the night
Shoot for thrills in the morning light

Right

Screaming in the dead of the night
Shoot for thrills in the morning light

Realize, realize, realize (8x)
Realize, if you realize (7x)
