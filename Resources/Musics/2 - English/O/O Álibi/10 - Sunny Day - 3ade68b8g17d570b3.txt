SUNNY DAY

Such a sunny day and I decide to call and ask
What you up to tonight
Just come with me, darling... darling
Can you fell that glow and we stil don't know
But I can see that shining into your eyes
If you have to feel
Feel it, feel it
When I feel that feeling, trust me; Just let it go
Cause we still have a big night to go
And you don't have to say nothing at all, nothing at all
Moments come and go and we never know
just feel that feeling and let it grow
And you don't have to say nothing at all, nothing at all

[Refrão]

Just pa, pa, pa, para... pararapa, pah, pah para
Pararapah, pa, pa, pah ra... Yeaahh
Pararapah pah. Para, para

Just pa, pa, pa, para... pararapa, pah, pah para
Pararapah, pa, pa, pah ra... Yeaahh
Pararapah pah. Para, para
