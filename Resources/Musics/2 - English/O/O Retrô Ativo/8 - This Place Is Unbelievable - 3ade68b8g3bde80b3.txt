THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLE

Driving for a funny day
I have nobody to talk to me
I received you message
You giving me a kick in ass

How I will pretend happy for the public tonight?
I'm drunk, and falling apart
But
This place is unbelievable
We want play here again
The people are so beautiful
Is good to forget something
This place is unbelievable
We want play here again
The people are so beautiful
If you are so high like me

Please forget what happened
I don't know what I did
You had sent me away
I just did what you said

If your intention was to put me down
You know that, I'll party out loud

This place is unbelievable
We want play here again
The people are so beautiful
Is good to forget something
This place is unbelievable
We want play here again
The people are so beautiful
If you are so high like me
