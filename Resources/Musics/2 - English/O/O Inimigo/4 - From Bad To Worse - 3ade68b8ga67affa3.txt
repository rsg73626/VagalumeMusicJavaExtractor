FROM BAD TO WORSE

A complete change
Is too much to hope for
We run in different directions
Tied in our own obsessions

And things go from bad to worse

Was built  a wall  between us
And no matter how loud we shout
Nobody listens
Nobody cares

From bad to worse !

No more mr. hand shaker
There is no place in this room for you
You turn things from bad to worse.

Your presence turn things
From bad to worse.

You turn things from bad to worse.
And no matter how loud we shout
Nobody listens, nobody cares.
