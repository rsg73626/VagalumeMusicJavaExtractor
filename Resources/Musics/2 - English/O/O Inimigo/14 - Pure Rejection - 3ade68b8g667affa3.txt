PURE REJECTION

Life is full of funny things
Driving me insane
But why is it funny if I can't hear no laughs
I can't hear no laughs

I will not kneel and confess
Humiliation and loneliness
Every day a new trap.

I don't need protection - I am the pure rejection
I don't need prevention - just pure destruction

Full  of scars - - but still breathing
Sore and tired
Find no salvation, find no divine
Self confined,  dead inside

Don't need protection ? I'm the objection
Don't need no bless    ? I'm  pure rejection

No longer alive
Just dead inside
Find no salvation
Find no divine
