LOVE WILL FIND A WAY

Kiara:
In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have the world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave, or strong, or smart
But somewhere 
in my secret heart

I know 
love will find a way
Anywhere I go, 
I'm home
If you are there beside me
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

Kovu:
I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong,
and so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes

Together:
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you
They'd know
Love will find a way
Anywhere we go,
we're home
If we are there together
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now I've found you
Love will find a way
I know 
love will find a way
