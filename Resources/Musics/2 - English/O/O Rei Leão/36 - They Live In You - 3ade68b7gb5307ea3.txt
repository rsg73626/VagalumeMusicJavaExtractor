THEY LIVE IN YOU

Chorus:
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala

Night
And the spirit of life
Calling
Mamela
And a voice
With the fear of a child aswers
Mamela

Wait
There's no mountain too great
Hear these words and have faith
Have faith

They live in you
They live in me
They're watching over
Everything we see
In every creature
In every star
In your reflection
They live in you

They live in you
They live in me
They're watching over
Everything we see
In every creature
In every star
In your reflection
They live in you

Chorus
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala
