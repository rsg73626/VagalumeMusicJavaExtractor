TIMON'S DREAM

scury, sniff, flinch
scury, sniff, flinch
scury, sniff, flinch

Theres more to life than panic,
and being some other guys snack (ick),
i may be delicious, organic,
but this lil ontrays fightin back,
im gonna leave tunnels behind me,
and move to a new altitude,
im gonna reach to the stars to remind me,
that meer cats are not meerly food!

For once il beeeeee (woh woh woh ooh)
lookin out for meeeeeeee....

Il tell ya what i want, this cat is movin on,
cos im one hot dog, whos missin out on fun,
il be a bigger cheeze, far from the desert scene,
a littel cooling breeze, a lil pagent green,

And il be snoozin in my hamock by a ripplin stream,
many miles from any tunnel and the digging team,
lookin out for number one will be my only dream,
thats all i want, thats all i need.

Ive allways been good at running away,
but now im gonna run the sho-o-ow,
ive always been seen as the ultimate prey,
but now my status aint so quo!

I dreem sublime,
its hi-eena tiiiiiiime!
