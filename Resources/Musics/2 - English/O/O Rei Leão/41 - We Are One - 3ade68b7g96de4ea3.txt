WE ARE ONE

As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned

But you'll see every day
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams
Come undone
We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are 
We are one

If there is so much I must be,
Can I still just be me
The way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part 
Of some big plan?

Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun
Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

We are one, you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun
All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see
We are one
