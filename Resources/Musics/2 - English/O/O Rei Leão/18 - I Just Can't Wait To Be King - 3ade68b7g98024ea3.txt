I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING

I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware!

Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair

I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my Roar

Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
(You've rather a long way to go, young master
if you think...)

No one saying do this
(Now when I said that, I -)
No one saying be there
(What I meant was...)
No one saying stop that
(Look, what you don't realize...)
No one saying see here
(Now see here!)

Free to run around all day
(Well, that's definitely out...)
Free to do it all my way!

I think it's time that you and I
Arranged a heart to heart

Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start

If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Everybody look left
Everybody look right

Everywhere you look I'm
Standing in the spotlight!

Not yet!

Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't waait... to be king!
