SHADOWLAND

Fatshe leso lea halalela
The land of our ancestors is holy
Fatshe leso lea halalela

Shadowland
The leaves have fallen
This shadowed land
This was our home

The river's dry
The ground has broken
So I must go
Now I must go

And where the journey may lead me
Let your prayers be my guide
I cannot stay here, my family
But I'll remember my pride

Prideland	
I have no choice
My land
I will find my way
Tear-stained
Lea halalela
Dry land
Take this	
Take this prayer
With you
What lies out there
Fatshe leso
Lea halalela

And where the journey may lead you
Let this prayer be your guide
Though it may take you so far away
Always remember your pride

Fatshe leso lea halalela
Fatshe leso lea halalela
Fatshe leso lea halalela

And where the journey may lead you
Let this prayer be your guide
Though it may take you so far away
Always remember your pride

And where the journey may lead you
Giza buyabo, giza buyabo
Let this prayer be your guide
I will return, I will return
Beso bo
Though it may take you so far away
Giza buyabo, I will return
Always remember your pride	
Giza buyabo, oh giza buyabo
Beso bo, my people, beso bo
