THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT

In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

(Chorus)
A whim away, a whim away

Near the village, the peaceful village
The lion sleeps tonight
Near the village, the peaceful village
The lion sleeps tonight

(Chorus)
A whim away, a whim away

Hush, my darling, don't fear, my darling
The lion sleeps tonight
Hush, my darling, don't fear, my darling
The lion sleeps tonight

(chorus)
A whim away, a whim away

Near the village, the peaceful village
The lion sleeps tonight
Near the village, the quiet village
The lion sleeps tonight

(Chorus)
A whim away, a whim away

My little darling
Don't fear, my little darling
My little darling
Don't fear, my little darling
