MY LULLABY

Hush, my little one; you must be exhausted

Sleep, my little Kovu
Let your dreams take wing
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king

I've been exiled, persucuted
Left alone with no defense
When I think of what that brute did
I get a little tense

But I dream a dream so pretty
That I don't feel so depressed
'Cause it soothes my inner kitty
And it helps me get some rest

The sound of Simba's dying gasp
His daughter squealing in my grasp
His lionesses' mournful cry
That's my lullaby

Now the past I've tried forgetting
And my foes I could forgive
Trouble is I knows it's petty
But I hate to let them live

So you found yourself somebody who'd chase Simba up a tree

Oh, the battle may be bloody, but that kind of works for me

The melody of angry growls
A counterpoint of painful howls
A symphony of death, oh my!
That's my lullaby

Scar is gone... but Zira's still around
To love this little lad
Till he learns to be a killer
With a lust for being bad!

Nuka
Sleep, ya little termite!
Uh-- I mean, precious little thing!
Vitani
One day when you're big and strong
Zira
You will be a king!

The pounding of the drums of war
The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar

The joy of vengeance
Testify!
I can hear the cheering
Kovu! What a guy!

Payback time is nearing
And then our flag will fly
Against a blood-red sky
That's my lullaby!
