I INSIST

Always
I gess I can reach
I can catch me feelings
my thoughts
Millions of them
Flying over my head
There was something here
But it's gone between my fingers
I almost caught but it is gone
Always
I think I can't
But I insist I always did and I have done
I take a pen and write down my words
There's sometinhg here
I will do it my entire life
I will do all my days and nights
