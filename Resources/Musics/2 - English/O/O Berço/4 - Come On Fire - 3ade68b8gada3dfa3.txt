COME ON FIRE

Sometimes I hear that all are Little boxes,
Little boxes without content,
How about going out for a night
of fucking crazy factory,
Give me your hand, give me your hand

But if you come darling, come on fire
Cause now I'll burn one down
Cause my way is a light, 
That shines on your flaming soul

But If you come baby, hold on
Cause youâ€™ll never be alone again,     
Our home is so true, 
We are mother nature's son, come on.

And we'll pray, all togheter we'll pray, 
for all the people who says, 
That money buys everything.

And we'll pray, we pray for Jesus, 
To give only love in return, 
Just drink the water were you came from.
