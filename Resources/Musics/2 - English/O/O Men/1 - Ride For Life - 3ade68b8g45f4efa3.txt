RIDE FOR LIFE

Chorus:
I just need to know one thing, one thing
Lemme hear ya
Now if you rolling with me
Tell me please, would you ride for life?
If I said goodbye tonight? (2x)

I ain't afraid no more, now watch me work wonder
Finna aim for the sky like a bird hunter
Black sox fitted, backwards bill
Spit flame, run game like track and field

So fake mine, y'all should get an acting deal
I'm nothing to toy with, no happy meal
Bringing back the real, now I'm out with
A gang of starr's world premiere, getting
Mass appeal boy,

Young, gifted and black
Long way from chi city
But it's still on my back
Quickly had to adapt to
Fast living

Hoes and fast women
Red toes with black denim
Shows packed wit' em'
Groupies are nominated
For them hotel accommodations

If it's complicated, they get no conversation
Passed the bottle, I ain't drink the henny
These girls wanna get me drunk
So they don't feel like hoes for sleeping with me
Seeing envy from my hometown peers

If they only knew that love was stronger than fear
Either way I guess I do it on my own
Guarantee they miss me when I'm gone

Chorus
I just need to know one thing, one thing
Lemme hear ya
Now if you rolling with me
Tell me please, would you ride for life?
If I said goodbye tonight? (2x)

Now they say I'm so mysterious
Flow heavy, leave em' hurting like periods
I'm that deal, no nonsense
Ya looking fly girl, come and see the cockpit
I let ch'all be gangstas, I'll just be a prophet

Never get it mixed up, haters keep ya lips shut
You can see my fly, even when the jeans zipped up
Ya see I'm getting busy, ya whole fan base like who is he?
Ya got cold feet, cuz my mind don't sleep

Even palm readers look and say my lines so deep
I'm the center of attention, better find yo seat
See the light through the clouds, bet it shine on me

Man, I grind solely, for the passion
Give me all the cash, and the girls and the fashion
Give me all the cars, all the jewelry and mansions
But first I want classics

Chorus
I just need to know one thing, one thing
Lemme hear ya
Now if you rolling with me
Tell me please, would you ride for life?
If I said goodbye tonight? (2x)
Ya finna see another side of me
See exactly what's inside of me
But if I had to say goodbye today
Just let me know that you'll ride for me (2x)
