I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ME

Hey lady, you lady, cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you never do
But I wish someone had talk to me
Like I.. wanna talk to you

Ooh, I've been to Georgia, and California, and anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we.. made love in the sun
But I've ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise
But I've.. never been to me

Please lady, please lady, don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has.. lived a million lives

Ooh I've been to Neese
And the isle of Greece where they sip champagne on a yacht
I've moved like Harlow in Montecarlo and showed them what I've got
I've been undressed by hands, and I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life and never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free
I've been to paradise
Never been to me
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
Ohh Yeah yeah yeah
