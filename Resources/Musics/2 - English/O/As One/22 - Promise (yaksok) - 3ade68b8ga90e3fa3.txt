PROMISE (YAKSOK)

Today I will cry,
But tomorrow I will laugh as I look to the happy future
I can't erase the tears that fall with the lost chances
But I'll forget them
I'm young but I'll know sadness,
I'll know that the world is so beautiful
My image is reflected back in the mirror
My shiny reflection is far away, but
Finally the rain will bring you the answer

You eyes will see the bright, new world in front of you
We'll be able to live happily there

I will keep all my promises
I will believe in myself, everything will go well
When your hate grows and mistakes come back
You will feel less certain
Recently you feel shakey, but I promise you
My eyes will see the new world before them
Our love will last for eternity
All my hopes and dreams will come true
You should believe in our love, we will be fine

Today I will cry,
But tomorrow I will laugh as I look to the happy future
