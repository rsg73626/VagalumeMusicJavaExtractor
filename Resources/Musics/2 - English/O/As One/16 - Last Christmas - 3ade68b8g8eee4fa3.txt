LAST CHRISTMAS

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying "I love you"
And meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again 

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My God I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart (ooh-ohh)
Now I’ve found a real love you’ll never fool me again

Gave you, gave you all my heart
And then you torn my love apart
And now I, now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again
