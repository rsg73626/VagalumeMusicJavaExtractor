WITHOUT YOU.. I'M LIKE THAT

how are you doing right now?
when i really miss you, i become very talkative within my friends..

when i hold up a mirror and look into it, i start to cry all of a sudden..
this must be seperation from you..


you know..
i told you i'm like this.. you said that i would find someone else..
that i would be able to forget you..


i can't even forget one of your little habits..
in this world, there's some things you can't do..
my dear.. i told you..

at first, after i looked at you, i had faith that there were better people..
but i couldnt bear the thought of time by myself..


even though it's not that.. in your memory is it unreasonably sad...
we really did seperate..

you know.. i told you if it gets hard.. to be happy
but you didn't know that it wasn't really my feelings..

even though there was many hurtful things you did to my heart over and over again..
in this world.. there is still one thing that only you hold.. you are my only love..

dont hurry and forget me.. it's my one desire/wish..
i'm the only one breathing wholly moment by moment..

i told you i'm like this.. you said that i would find someone else..
that i would be able to forget you..

even though there was many hurtful things you did to my heart over and over again..
in this world.. there is still one thing that only you hold.. you are my only love..
