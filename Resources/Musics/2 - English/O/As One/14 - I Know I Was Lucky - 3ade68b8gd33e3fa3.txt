I KNOW I WAS LUCKY

I know I was lucky
That we were so alike....
I'll try to be a person who knows what the story says
You'll be a part of me in this world
Living alone is hard
I can't imagine living without you

* CHORUS *
Forever as one~
Like now my heart wants to care for you
Forever as one~
Forever by your side

It may be the same as what it seems
We are walking along the same path
There are no tears in my heart
Better than my friend
This world will not be easy
Can you be mine forever?

* Repeat chorus *

I am so grateful
And I believe that you have no secrets from me

* Repeat chorus *
