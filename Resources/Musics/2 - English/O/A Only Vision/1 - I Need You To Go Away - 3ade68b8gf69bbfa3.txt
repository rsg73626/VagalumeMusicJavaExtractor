I NEED YOU TO GO AWAY

I JUST NEVER SAY THINGS I NEED TO SAY TO YOU
DREAMS I MADE DREAMS OF YOU TONIGH
GO, GO, GO, GO AWAY
I CANT NOT SEE YOU WITHOUT ME
FOLLOW YOUR WAY BACK TO ME
TONIGHT, TONIGHT!

GO AWAY, I NEVER MEANT TO SAY GOODBYE
AND NOW?
I JUST NEED YOU FORGET ABOUT YOU
GO AWAY, I NEVER MEANT TO SAY GOODBYE
I NEED YOU TO GO AWAY
I NEED YOU TO GO AWAY

WHEN YOU RETORN DO NOW RETORN THE LOVE
LEAVE BEHIND AND THE NOW RETORN TO ME
AND I SAY TO YOU FORGET ME
AND I SAY TO YOU GO AWAY
FOLLOW YOUR WAY BACK TO ME
TONIGHT, TONIGHT!

GO AWAY, I NEVER MEANT TO SAY GOODBYE
AND NOW?
I JUST NEED YOU FORGET ABOUT YOU
GO AWAY, I NEVER MEANT TO SAY GOODBYE
I NEED YOU TO GO AWAY
I NEED YOU TO GO AWAY
