MY MOM

Who picks me up when I am down
Makes me smile wipes my frown
She provide for all my needs
Loves and hugs and cloths and feeds

M-Y M-O-M... MY MOM!
M-Y M-O-M... MY MOM!

Everytime I get on trouble
She sorts thing out on the double
She made me all but she's the bomb
She's my friend I called her mom

M-Y M-O-M... MY MOM!
M-Y M-O-M... MY MOM!
