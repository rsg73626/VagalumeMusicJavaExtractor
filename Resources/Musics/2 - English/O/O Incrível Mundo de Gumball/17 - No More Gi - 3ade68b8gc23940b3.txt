NO MORE GI

Life's about abandoning, dream after dream
Hopes and expectations, float away downstream
It's time to kiss our childish ways goodbye
Grow up? Give mediocrity a try?
The games, they have to stop
No more hi-yah!
Not even a karate chop
Face up to what maturity means, and forget about our martial arts dreams
