LIFE CAN MAKE YOU SMILE

Look at me as I'm standing here
I've got happy on my face, I've got nothing to fear!
I've got my legs, eyes, ears, my teeth and gums
I've got six working fingers and opposable thumbs

(Life can make you smile!)
Well look around and you'll see it everywhere, I said
(Life can make you smile!)
So I carry on smiling cause I haven't got a care!

A power-shower can lift you from a rut
Although the shower curtain keeps on sticking to my butt
I'm loving orange juice, so I fill it to the brim
But after cleaning my teeth, the taste is pretty grim

I love the scent of flowers, but so do all the bees!
And the pollen, [sneezes] brings out my allergies
And video games, they stop me from feeling glum
Although after an hour, they start to hurt my thumbs

(Life can be a trial!)
Look around you and you'll see it everywhere
(Life can be a trial!)
But I'll try to get through it and pretend that I don't care

But this game's too hard, I got stuck on level eight
That ain't the only thing bad that I hate!
I've got the sun on the screen and the net's too slow
And the ice has diluted down my soda, don't you know?
There's the dripping faucet and the creaking door
Man I'm so exhausted, I can't take it anymore!

(Why is life so vile?)
Look around you, it's out to bring you down, I said
(Why is life so vile?)
And even this song is becoming annoying now!
