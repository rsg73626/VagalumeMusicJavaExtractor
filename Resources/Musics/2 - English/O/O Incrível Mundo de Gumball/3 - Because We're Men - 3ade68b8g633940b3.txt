BECAUSE WE'RE MEN

Wait a minute, we don't have to listen to you anymore
Because we're MEN!

We're gonna test drive a car
And say we need a little time to think about it
Because we're men!
We're gonna pay more for the movies
and chop down trees, and eat a lot of meat
Because we're men!
And we can have our own kids!
but we're gonna wait until we meet the right person because it's an important decision
But in the meantime we can barbecue!
Buy power tools!
Get tattoos!
Buy our... own shooes!
