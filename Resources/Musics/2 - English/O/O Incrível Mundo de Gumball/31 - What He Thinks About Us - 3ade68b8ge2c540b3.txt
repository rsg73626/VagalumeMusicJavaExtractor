WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT US

I feel like
Dude what are you doing?
I feel like!
Ever since I was a young fish
I always held my tongue
Never spoke the words I felt inside and now my time has come
I'd push my feelings deep deep down, now I'll tell the world
Exactly what I think and feel about every boy and girl
Every boy and girl!
Yeah!

Gonna tell us what he thinks about us!
Gonna tell us what to do!
Gonna tell us what he thinks about us!
Gonna show us something new!
Stop!

Masami's popular and funny, 
but your friends just like you for your money
We only like you for your money!
Jamie's rude and impolite 
because she's half cow half troglodyte

She's half-cow half-troglodyte!
Carrie thinks her style's unique 
but she's just one more emo freak

She's just one more emo freak!
Joe your jokes are lame and lazy 
and you sing just like a dog with rabies!
Where do people go when they run off crying?
