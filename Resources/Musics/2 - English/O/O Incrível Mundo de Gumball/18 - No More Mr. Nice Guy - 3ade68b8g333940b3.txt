NO MORE MR. NICE GUY

No more Mr. Nice Guy!
I've found a new style
With claws, and pointy teeth, and a villainous smile!

Goodbye goody two shoes I'm no longer uptight
Cos now I'm a shark and I'm ready to bite!

And I'll say what I want, and the truth's gonna sting
I'll be brutal and blunt, it will hurt when I sing!

So look out worl
