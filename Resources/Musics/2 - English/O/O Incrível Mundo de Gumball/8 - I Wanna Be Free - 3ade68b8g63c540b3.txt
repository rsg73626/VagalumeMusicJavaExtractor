I WANNA BE FREE

Up til' now, my life's been good. 
Treated me well, I can't complain. 
Met a woman, raised the kid and every day just felt the same. 
But there's something deep inside of me 
that always wanted to be free. 
And now I think the time is right to show you what I mean

I wanna sing, I wanna dance! 
I wanna touch the sky with my own two hands!

If I sing to the world, it'll set me free, 
and let me be who I wanna be!

Dance, dance and sing! I'm gonna give it my everything! 
And fortune and fame will be at my command, 
as I whisk you off to a wonderland!

I'll press down to the bump, to the rock and the roll, 
I'll tango and jango, and the hanky and panky. 
I'll fly like a bird if you set me free!

Like a skylark on the wing, or a rosebud in the spring, 
like a gangster and his bling, like fish bait from a sling, 
like a puppet with no string, like an English feudal king!
Like all those kinds of wonderful, wonderful, things!

I wanna be free... !
