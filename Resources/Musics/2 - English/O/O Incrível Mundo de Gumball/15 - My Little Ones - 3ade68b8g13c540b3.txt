MY LITTLE ONES

I remember when you were still little
My little ones
I was the giant, who picked you up, when you fell down
And life was just one funny riddle
My little ones
We laughed everyday as the world went around

I was the hero
Who taught you how to talk
I was the hero
Who taught you how to walk

And now you're no longer so little
My little ones
You'll see so much more than I ever will see
And though I'm just dad, not a hero
My little ones
Being just dad's good enough for me
