A FINE LADY

She's as cool as nighttime
She's as bright as day
When she looks in your eyes
She takes your breath away

She could move a mountain
Make a fire start
On a smaller scale
She could break your heart

She's a lady!
A fine lady!
She looks like an angel
She's sent from above

She's a lady!
A super lady!
And with this kitten I'm smitten
I'm bitten by the bug they call love!

Now the lady may be mine
(The lady may be mine.)
Yeah, the lady may be mine
