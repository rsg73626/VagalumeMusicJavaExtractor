PIZZA RAP

Here I am, I got a J-O-B
Earnin' plenty o' dough for my family
Yeah, I'm Richard Watterson, employee
So have some R-E-S-P-C-K-T

I got a pizza in the box
I got a cola in the bottle
And I'll get it to ya' faster when I'm pullin' on the throttle!
Mild or spicy, my flavors will exhilarate
You get them double-quickly when I'm twisting the accelerator!

twisting the accelerator!
twisting the accelerator!
