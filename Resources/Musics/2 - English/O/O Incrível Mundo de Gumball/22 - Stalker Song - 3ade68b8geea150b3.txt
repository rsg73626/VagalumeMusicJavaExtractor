STALKER SONG

For a very long time
I've watched you from afar
Hunched in your closet
Or strapped beneath your car
I treasured all the stories
The three of us share
Wherever you are
I'll always be there
When you were alone
I was there too
Behind the shower curtain
And you never knew
I dressed in your clothes
And breathed in your air
I watched you both sleep
And nuzzled your hair
It helps that your bedroom has places to hide
And the windows don't lock
So I can get inside
I've waited so long
To be part of your life
And one day one of you
Will call me his wife
