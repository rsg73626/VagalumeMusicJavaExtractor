DETENTION SONG

Well, I cheated on a math test
teacher says I gotta pay
Doin' time up at the schoolhouse
and it gets worse everyday

I've done a lot of bad things
as freedom wilted away
I've seen a lot of sad things
and it gets worse everyday

I never was a bad guy
'til I was put away
Now I'm stealin', cheatin', lyin'
and it gets worse everyday

They think I learned my lesson
That crime just doesn't pay
But stuck here in detention
I have found another way

I'm the baddest kid in the prison
and I get worse everyday
