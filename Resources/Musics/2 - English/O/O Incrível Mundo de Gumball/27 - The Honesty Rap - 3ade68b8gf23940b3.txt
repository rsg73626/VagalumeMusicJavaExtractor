THE HONESTY RAP

Uh uh uh uh Honesty!
Honesty!
Break it down

When you wanna be honest, just beware!
The truth hurts in this nitrogenic atmosphere!

You gotta wake up, realize and recognize!
Sometimes the truth, has strategical lies!

But keep them lies of a manageable size
or tears will arise, and hurt their eyes!

So before you speak, it's best to remember
Each individual case will require a specific judgement
call depending on who you are talking to and the context
of the conversation!
