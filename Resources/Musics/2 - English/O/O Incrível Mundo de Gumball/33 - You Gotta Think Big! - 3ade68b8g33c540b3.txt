YOU GOTTA THINK BIG!

I was a feeble minded guy. I'd slip on ice and wonder why
So many obstacles were thrown my way. 
On a down ward slide each and every day

But something popped inside my brain. 
I got up to fight that fight again
And I knew what to do. I went through the mental pain
You gotta think big. Think deep

Pretty soon you'll make that quantum leap
Think big. Think smart
Make your brain your finest body part. 
The greatest minds from yesterday

Will be crushed to dust 'cause I'm on my way. 
(Think big think big.)

You gotta think big!
