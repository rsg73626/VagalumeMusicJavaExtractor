BLOOD STAINS

These blood stains that won't leave my fingers
Won't allow me to forget it
What have I done
So many years from now

The ones I've killed, the ones I've tortured
Scream to me when I go to bed
To all they're gone
But in my mind they live

Never guilty
The law was always by my side
But in my spirit
You know I can't be free
