SO LONG AND THANKS ALL FISH

So long and thanks for all the fish
So sad that it should come to this
We tried to warn you all but oh dear
You may not share our intellect

Which might explain your disrespect
For all the natural wonders that grow around you
So long so long and thanks for all the fish
The world's about to be destroyed

There's no point getting all annoyed
Lie back and let the planet dissolve around you
Despite those nets of tuna fleets
We thought most of you were sweet

Especially tiny tots and your pregnant women
So long so long and thanks for all the fish
If I had just one last wish
I would like a tasty fish

If we could just change one thing
We would all have learnt to sing
Come one and all
Man and mammal

Side by side in life's great gene pool
So long so long and thanks for all the fish
