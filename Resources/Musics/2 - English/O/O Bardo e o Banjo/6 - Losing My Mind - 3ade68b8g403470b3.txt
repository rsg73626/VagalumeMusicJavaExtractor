LOSING MY MIND

I saw the train that
Was coming last night
Out of the rail
Flying over light

I'm losing, losing
Losing my mind
I'm losing, losing
Again this time

It wasn't strange
Cause my head was in fire
Breaking all the chains
Of my desires

I remember my father
Saing before he dies
"Son, you need a time
To think about your life"

I don't know why
My father told that lie
Maybe I should quit drinking
And meet Jesus christ
