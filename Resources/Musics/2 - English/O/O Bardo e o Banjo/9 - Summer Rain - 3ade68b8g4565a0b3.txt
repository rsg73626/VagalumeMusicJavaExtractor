SUMMER RAIN

The whispers are going, following the wind
But they are not the same
Changing the pressure, blowing the ashes
Making a brand new day

Ohh summer rain
Ohh summer rain

The whispers turn up
Into a velvet mantle
Disturbing a layman
Crossing the river, focus on the shiver
Taking my soul off the land

Ohh summer rain
Ohh summer rain
