YOU NEED SOME HOPE

Some nightmares can go thru
A few long nights
Some people say
It's just dark memories
That persist come in your mind

The waiting for tomorrow
Can take a long, long loong time
You don't have all this patience
My friend, so just do what you
Think is right

But, what's right?
To be a peace or disturb my mind?
Maybe create the peace
With the chaos in your heart

Yes! The chaos and the peace
They can co-exist
Free your fears and have trust
Something that's more, than you think

Sit down and watch the trees
Standing alone with the falling leaves
Waiting for spring and melodies
That never come

It's time to change the road
Keep yout way on this water flow
You can't live for dark memories
You need some hope

Can you see that little
Bird flying so high?
Spreading wings and dancing
Between (the) clouds, gilding
Through the sky

Why do you harden your feet
And don't move to the next step?
Is it so hard to reveal your faults
And yout losses? Why don't you
Sing them to the world?
