BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on a moonlight night the stars were shining bright
When they whispered from on high your love has said good-bye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said good-bye
