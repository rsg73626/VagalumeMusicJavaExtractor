GO AWAY

I belive better days are coming
All the greed will be far away
and I think I can trust and learn that
every second is not the same

Go away, leaving behind your bad days
Go away, leaving behind all that remains

I'm talking about freedom son
Belive in yourself and what you
can't do with your own hands
Move on, wake up, go away
and that's the way it goes

Go away, leaving behind your bad days
Go away, leaving behind all that remains

Go away, leaving behind your bad days
Go away, leaving behind all that remains

I'll be free as a bird
And I'll ride the hills of bluegrass
And I'll drink good clean whiskey
Singing all night long for all my days
