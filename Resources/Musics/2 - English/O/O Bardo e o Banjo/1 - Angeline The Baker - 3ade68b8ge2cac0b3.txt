ANGELINE THE BAKER

Angeline the baker
Lives in our village green
The way I always loved her beats all you ever seen

Angeline the baker
Her age is forty-three
I bought her candy by the peck and she won't marry me

I'll never marry no other girl
No matter where I go
I said I'd marry Angeline just twenty years ago

Angeline the baker
Her age is forty-three
I bought her candy by the peck and she won't marry me
