THE FALL OF WILLIE JAMES

The story tells about young man
That travel across the land
His name was Willie James
He used drink a lot

The people say he was stroller
But I really didn't know
I think he was a rich man
Just looking for some fun

After years traveling
His ways let him to portland
The city was a good place
To drink and find some girls

Willie thought he was in paradise
But willie doesn't know
That he was falling in a big
And deep deep hole

The fall of willie james
Put a hole in my mine
I never thought a good boy
Could live in the dark

Portland has some secret like an undreground floor
Drink more whiskey and sing all night long
Jump to the table and after to the ground
And sing his is the song of willie's fall

The fall of Willie James
Put a hole in my mine
I never thought a good boy
Could live in the dark
