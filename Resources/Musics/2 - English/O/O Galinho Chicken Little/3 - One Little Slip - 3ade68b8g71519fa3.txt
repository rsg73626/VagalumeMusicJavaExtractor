ONE LITTLE SLIP

It was a recipe for disaster
A four-course meal of no Sirree
It semed that happily ever after
Was happy everyone was after me
It was a cup of good intentions
A tablespon of one big mess
A dash of overreaction
I assume you know the rest

One little slip
One little slip
It was a fusion of confusion
With a few confounding things

I guess I probably took the wrong direction
Well, I admit I might have missed a sign or two
I ran a light past your affection
That humiliation never knew
I took a right turn at confusion
A left, when I should have gone straight on through

I get the feeling in this town
I'll never live 'till live down
That one mistake that seems to follow me around
They'll forget about the sky
When they all realize this guy's about to
Try to learn to fly or hit the ground

It was a cup of good intentions
A tablespon of one big mess
A dash of overreaction
I assume you know the rest

One little slip
One little slip
It was a humble little stumble
With a big ungraceful
One little slip
One little slip
It was a fusion of confusion
With a few confounding things
