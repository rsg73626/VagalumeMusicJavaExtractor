ALL I KNOW

I bruise you,you bruise me
We both bruise so easily
Too easily,to let it show
I love you,and thats all I know

All my plans keep fallin`through
All my plans,they depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you,and thats all

Its really all I know
Its all I Know
Its all I know

Its all I know
