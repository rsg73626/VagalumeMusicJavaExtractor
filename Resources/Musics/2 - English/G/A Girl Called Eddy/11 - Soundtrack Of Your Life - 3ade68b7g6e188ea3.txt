SOUNDTRACK OF YOUR LIFE

Fuzzes on buses and subway train
I'll keep on singing you settled a flame (?)
And if ignorance is blessed
Well sealed it with a kiss
But it was never supposed to end like this

This is the soundtrack of your life, baby
This is the soundtrack of your life, life

Well each step you take
You think you hear the sound of midnight cowboy
But it's just the clouds's putting your head on

Go and have another cigarette
And put out that you'll forget
What I meant to you was that's what you do

This is the soundtrack of your life, baby
This is the soundtrack of your life, life
This is the soundtrack of your life
This is the soundtrack of your life

Oh, I could have loved you, baby, 'til my dying day
Oh, why did you leave my heart on, my sweet, standing on Broadway
Standing on Broadway

Hmmmâ€¦ I could have loved you, baby
Standing on Broadway

This is the soundtrack of your life, baby
This is the soundtrack of your life, life
This is the soundtrack of your life, life
This is the soundtrack of your life, life
