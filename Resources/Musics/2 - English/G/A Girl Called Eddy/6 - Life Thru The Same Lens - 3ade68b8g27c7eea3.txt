LIFE THRU THE SAME LENS

We see life through the same lens
That's what you said to me
And I knew that it was true
Until you threw my heart in the sea

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real

If it's life on the defence
The stinging pain of being made to fool
All the cynics and the irony
Won't save you when you're drowning
In loves' sweet pool

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real
Baby, baby

It's only fair that you tell me
Just what it was you think I did wrong
If I was looking through the same lens
My prescription must've been all wrong

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to fell
How do I act like we never kissed
When everything is saying it was oh so real

If we saw through the same lens
Then you'd see I want you here right now
Instead of waiting for the day
When memory has clouded
Everything we loved about it

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real

How do you adjust your vision
How do you pretend not to care
How do I act like we never met
And that you didn't see
What we know was there baby
Baby
