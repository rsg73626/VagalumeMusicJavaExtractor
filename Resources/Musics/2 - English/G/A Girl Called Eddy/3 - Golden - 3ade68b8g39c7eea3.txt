GOLDEN

Last night I dreamed
While I was walking that I died looking up
At fancy buildings and skyscrapers
Are real heartbreakers
When your time has come and gone
It could've been all yours for a song

Of all the things I ever wanted
It was you
And love and freedom
But I was a girl haunted
In the blue, undaunted

Just swimming for the shore
Wondering what the hurt is for

But tonight I know why I'm here
I don't need to lose you to know
That it's already golden

Tonight I know in my heart
I don't need to die just to see
That it's already golden
That it's already golden

So take the purple
And take the black
And take all the colors of heartache back
And throw them in the sea
And say you love me
Keep the silver, keep the gold
Stay wand watch the world get old

'Cause tonight I know why I'm here
I don't need to lose you to know
That It's already golden

Tonight I know in my heart
I don't need to die just to see
That it's already golden
It's already golden
It's already golden
It's already golden
It's already golden
It's already golden
