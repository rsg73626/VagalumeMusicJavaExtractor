UNDER THE WARM SUN

( The Long Goodbye EP )

Under the warm sun
Under the warm sun

I've found my way
It took a while
Now it's not hard
For me to smile
We found a place
Under the warm sun

Living a life
We always dreamed
Me loving you
You loving me
We found a place
Under the warm sun

And life is sweeter than I ever thought it could be
If you'd have told me I never would have believed

The trouble can go
Back where it came
Give me some joy
You're all the same
We found a place
Under the warm sun

I've been so tired of being so cold
Just wanted that sunny place to grow old
Give up the chase
Under the warm sun

And life is sweeter than I ever thought it could be
If you'd have told me I never would have believed

I found my way
It took some time
Now we are here
Now we can shine
We found a place
Under the warm sun
Under the warm sun
Under the warm sun
Under the warm sun
Under the warm sun
