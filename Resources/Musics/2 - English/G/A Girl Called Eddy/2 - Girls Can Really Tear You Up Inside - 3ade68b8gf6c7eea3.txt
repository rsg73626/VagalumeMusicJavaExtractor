GIRLS CAN REALLY TEAR YOU UP INSIDE

There's a girl whose stuck inside a picture frame
She's seen your face her mother's mentioned once your name
She sits and dreams her fifteen year old dreams of what to do
She's heard you sing and that your eyes are very very very blue

Why do you run
Why do you hide
From all you are
You're just a man

But she could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside
She could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside

She has a home outside this little picture frame
You're not in it and she wants someone to blame
Do you remember what it's like to be that young
All the pages that are blank all the songs yet to be sung

Why do you run
Why do you hide
From all she is
She's just a girl

But girls can tear you up inside
Tear you up inside
They could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside

If there are words you want to say
She's waiting for that rainy, that rainy day

Why do you run
Why do you hide
From all she is
She's just a girl
Tear you up inside
You're just a boy
Tear you up inside
They could tear you up inside
Tomorrow's gonna comes anyway
And you can see it in the inside
They could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside...
