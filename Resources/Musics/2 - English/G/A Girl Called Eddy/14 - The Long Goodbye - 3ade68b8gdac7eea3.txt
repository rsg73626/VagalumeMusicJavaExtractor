THE LONG GOODBYE

You stormed my winter palace
You rid my heart of every bit of malice baby
You're how I won the war
Now your bags are packed
Your walking out the door
In every way
There is nothing to say anymore

This is the long goodbye
Maybe the tears will never dry
This is the long goodbye

Take your records, leave me mine
You're the one who said
We lived it all on the borrowed time
So, at the end of the day
There was nothing to say anymore

This is the long goodbye
Maybe the tears will never dry
This is the long goodbye
Leaving the past and you behind
This is the long goodbye

Take a good look, make it last
And when you've found the moments' past
Just remember that
Nobody loved you like me
Nobody loved you like me
Nobody loved you like me
Nobody loved you... like me

This is the long goodbye
Maybe the tears will never dry
This is the long goodbye
Leaving the past and you behind
This is the long goodbye
I'm out of words, I'm out of time
This is the long goodbye
This is the long goodbye
This is the long goodbye
