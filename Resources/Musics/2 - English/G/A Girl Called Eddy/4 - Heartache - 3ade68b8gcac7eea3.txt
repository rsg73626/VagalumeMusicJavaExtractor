HEARTACHE

Where did those crass band mornings go
And the dreaming over tea
God only knows
Was it so long ago
Your tried to let me know

You'd seen this face
Somewhere before
Now you know for sure
That you can call him

Heartache
Yes, you can call him that
You can call him
Heartache
You'll never take it back

Once there was spring inside his eyes
Now there's only autumn winds
And sad grey skies
And I'm such a fool
To think that I
Could change the rules
I'd seen his face
Somewhere before
Now I know for sure

That you can call him
Heartache
You can call him that
You can call him
Heartache
You'll never take it back

And you can call him
Heartache
Yes, you can call him that
You can call him
Heartache
You'll never take it back

You've seen his face
Somewhere before
Now you know for sure
