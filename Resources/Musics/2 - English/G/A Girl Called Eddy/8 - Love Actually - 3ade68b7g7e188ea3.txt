LOVE ACTUALLY

Here
Left to my own devices
I just keep on moving from crisis to crisis
It's sad but true
Til I met you

I've been drifting from problem to problem
Open to find
Some kind of answers to solve them
It's sad but true
What can I do

Well, love actually love is one thing I can do
And give, give all the love and the world to you
Oh, love actually love is one thing I can do
And give, give all the love and my heart to you

But I can't keep money in my placket, no
And I can't keep time
And I can't keep saying no
To things my heart wants to say yes to

Well, love actually love is one thing I can do
And give, give all the love and the world to you
Oh, love actually love is one thing I can do
And give, give all the love and my heart to you

Ba da ba daâ€¦
