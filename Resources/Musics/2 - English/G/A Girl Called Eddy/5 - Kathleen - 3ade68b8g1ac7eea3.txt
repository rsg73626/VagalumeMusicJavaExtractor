KATHLEEN

If I don't laugh i'll cry
At all the years going by
Why is it so hard
To say your name tonight

This little room we called home
These things I thought that we owned
And our small piece of the sky

Where did you go
Where did you go

Oh Kathleen
All of the stars in the sky
Went out one by one the day you said goodbye
I still can see your face

Kathleen
All of this got in our way
And left us always waiting for the day
When things were gonna change
And life would re-arrange for us

Oh Kathleen
You're still the same to me

Where was that place in the sun
We used to chase then would run from it
Well since you're gone I'm done
With it for good

Where did you go
Where did you go

Oh Kathleen
All of the stars in the sky
Went out one by one the day you said goodbye
I still can see your face

Kathleen
All of this got in our way
And left us always waiting for the day
When things were gonna change
And life would re-arrange for us

Oh Kathleen
Kathleen
Kathleen
Kathleen
