SOMEBODY HURT YOU

Boy
Somebody hurt you
Boy
I wish I knew who
Could look
Into your sad eyes
And make
Such a sweet thing cry

You're lonely like only the broken can know
Aching for love but afraid to show
See how I miss you

Boy
Someone might hurt you
But it would never be me
I'd wrap you inside me
Be free or just hide for awhile

'Cause I'm lonely like only the broken can know
Aching for love but afraid to show
Lonely like only the broken can be
Breaking my own heart to make you see
See how I miss you

Please don't run away from the things that are real
And don't be afraid of whatever you feel
I'm feeling it too
I'm feeling it too

Boy
If you go looking
For things like in younger days
There won't be an answer
Only love can change your ways

Your lovely like only the broken can know
Aching for love but afraid to show
Lonely like only the broken can be
Breaking your own heart to make me see

See how I miss you
Boy, somebody hurt you
Boy, somebody hurt you
Boy, somebody hurt you
Boy, somebody hurt you
Boy, somebody hurt you
Boy, somebody hurt you
Boy
