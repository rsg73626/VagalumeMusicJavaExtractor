THE SAME OLD TEARS

( Stephen Bishop cover / Tears All Over Town EP )

It's the same old tears on a new background
Seeing you as a fading photograph
It hurts too much to laugh these days

I'm all right
Yes, I'm all right
I'm all right

It's the same old song with a new melody
But this old candle's lingering flame is almost gone
To see you again is all that keeps me hanging on

But I'm all right
Yes, I'm all right
I'm all right

Remembering, remembering the familiar heartache
No one but you could ever make this dream come true

It's the same old me crying the same old tears
And I walk away like I always do
Still in love with you

But I'm all right
Yes, I'm all right
Iâ€™m all right

I'm all right
Yes, I'm all right
I'm all
I'm all right
