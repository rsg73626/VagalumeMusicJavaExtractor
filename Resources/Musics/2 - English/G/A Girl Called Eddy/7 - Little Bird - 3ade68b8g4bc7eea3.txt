LITTLE BIRD

Just like a little bird
Inside a little cage
Trying to find the strength
To learn to turn the page

Just like a mermaid
I am trapped under the sea
Trying to understand
What life wants me to be

Heroes and villains
And old lovers walk by
They tip their hats but
They never answer why

Why does it always seem
To bring me back to this
Searching for home
In someone else's gentle kiss
Searching for home in places
Home just don't exist

Heroes and villains
And old lovers walk by
They tip their hats but
They never answer why

So just like the mermaid
I will swim up to the light
Just like that little bird
It's time for me to fly
