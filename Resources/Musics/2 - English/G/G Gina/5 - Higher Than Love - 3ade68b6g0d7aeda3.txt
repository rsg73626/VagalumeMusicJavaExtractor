HIGHER THAN LOVE

Oh yeah
Got the feeling
Together we've got more than just love
All I need is a kiss from baby
That's not enough
Start believing
Don't question why - oh no
I've got the feeling (got the feeling)
I'm feeling so high
Chorus
Higher than love
Much higher than love
So happy to be your baby
We're higher than love
Higher than love
This situation is better than ever before
Your reputation only is me wanting you more
I can feel it but I don't why - oh no
When we're together (we're together)
It feels so high
Chorus
Higher than love
I'm in another state of mind
When we're together
And now I'll lose all sense of time
Forever we will fly
Higher than love! Oh yeah
Happy to be your baby
Repeat chorus to fade
