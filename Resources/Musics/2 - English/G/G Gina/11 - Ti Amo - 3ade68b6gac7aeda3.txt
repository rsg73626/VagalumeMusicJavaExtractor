TI AMO

ti amo dove sei andato, amore mio, amore mio

i remember when i saw your face
you caught me smiling, i had to look away
and i could not resist the promise of your kiss
now, dream is all i do, of paradise and you

chorus
i wanna be where the sun is shining
amore mio
i wanna have you there beside me
amore mio
now these lazy summer days
they seem so far away
but wherever you may go
ti amo

i remember sunsets on fire
endless nigth of passion
burning with desire
i close my eyes and i can see your smile
sky is clear, the ocean blue
i'm in paradise with you

chorus

take me back where the magic is
let me hold you in my arms
under the stars
rainy days and lonely nights
only darkness there's no light
without you in my life

ti amo

chorus
