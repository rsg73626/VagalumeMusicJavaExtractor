IT DOESN'T MEAN GOODBYE

It doesn't mean goodbye
He packed his bag and caught the train
As he brake the pouring rain
He left a note at home for you
But everything that he's been through
And when you feel no love inside (love inside)
And there's nowhere you can hide
Chorus
It doesn't mean goodbye
(He'll come back one day)
It doesn't mean goodbye
(He'll come back one day)
It doesn't mean the end
(Doesn't mean goodbye)
Well, he likes to play with fire
Teasing you with your desire
You got to play this guy just right
He holds and understands, you're in his masterplan
And if you feel love's let you down (let you down)
When there's no one else around
Chorus
It doesn't mean goodbye
And when you feel no love inside
And there's nowhere you can hide
Repeat chorus to end
