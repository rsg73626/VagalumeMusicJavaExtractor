FALLOW THE LIGHT

I will be there for you baby
For you baby, ooo-oh!
I will be there for you baby
For you baby, ooo-oh!
Turn around and let me read the secrets in your eyes
Face me now and tell me there's no secret you can hide
Close your eyes and trust your heart to show you what to do
I'm telling you something I believe in you
Chorus
If it takes a thousand days
Just follow the light back home
You can find your way
If you follow the light back home
I'll be here for you
Take your time the world that you should need or try to be
Never doubt the love without a question - that's the key!
Open up your heart and fire the flame to keep you warm
And love together
A shelter from the storm
Chorus
Gonna be there for you baby x 3
I believe in you
Gonna be there for you baby x 3
I believe in you
Chorus x 2
I'll be here for you
If you follow the light back home
I'll be here for you
If you follow the light back home
I will be there for you baby
For you baby, ooo-oh!
Repeat to fade
