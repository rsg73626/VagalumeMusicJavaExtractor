JUST A LITTLE BIT

you're my love
you're my sweetest thing
don't shy away
don't shy away
every night makes
me hate the days
can't get enough
of your love

am i wrong
am i so unkind
show me the way
don't turn away
i can't hide all these
every moment
i'm just thinking of you

Chorus
ooh ahh, just a little bit
ooh ahh, a little bit more
ooh ahh, just a little bit
you know what
i'm looking for
ooh ahh, just a little bit
ooh ahh, a little bit more
ooh ahh, just a little bit
i'll give you love
you can't ignore

feeling good
let's go all the way
it's got to be
set  me free
but tonight let
my body say
take it slow
don't let it go

how can i prove
my love to you
baby please
you're all i need
like a child
but it's more than a phase
could act the angel
but it wouldn't be true

chorus

what can you do for me
what can you do
cause i feel so alive
i feel your love inside
ooh!!

just a little bit
a little bit more
just a little bit
just a little
just a little bit
a little bit more
just a little bit
whoah whoah whoah whoah

chorus
(disregard last 2 lines)

just a little bit
