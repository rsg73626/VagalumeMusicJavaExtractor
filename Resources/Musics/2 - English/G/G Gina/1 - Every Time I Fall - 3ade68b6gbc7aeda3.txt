EVERY TIME I FALL

chorus
everytime i fall for your eyes
like the raindrops fall from the sky
everytime i hear your name
in this loving game

there is something in the way
your eyes talk to me
just as if the seem to say
(stay here with me, baby)
just as if they seem to say
(stay with me)

chorus

all i need is to express it all
my echo listens
when i hear myself confess
(you are my weakness)
when i hear myself confess
(you are my weakness)

chorus
i say, i say, i say
chorus x 2
chorus repeat to fade
