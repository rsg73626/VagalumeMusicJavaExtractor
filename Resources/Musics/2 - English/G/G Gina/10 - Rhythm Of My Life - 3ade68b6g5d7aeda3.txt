RHYTHM OF MY LIFE

Each night I go to bed
When I got that feeling tonight
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming of you baby
Reach out, take your time
Gonna take good care of this heart of mine
This is the boy so freeze him
Call him to you now
Chorus
Baby baby b-b-b-baby
To the rhythm of my life
I'm gonna be with you tonight
Baby baby b-b-b-baby
To the rhythm of my life
Make me feel alright
Boyfriend come with me
To a place I fall in fantasy
I'm waiting
I'll be there for you baby
Got your hand, rip your jeans
I'm a victim of your fax machine
My brother doesn't like you
But my sister thinks you're cool
Chorus
Baby baby, gonna be your baby
To the rhythm of my life
I wanna be with you tonight
Baby baby b-b-b-baby
To the rhythm of this before
To the lover I, to the lover I adore
I'm dreaming, dreaming of you baby
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you baby
Gonna take good care
Gonna take good care of this heart of mine
This is the boy so freeze him
Call him to you now
Repeat chorus to fade
