FRESH

hey boy, you wanna get fresh?

what would you say
if i kissed you right now
would you turn and walk away
or be asking me to stay?
what would you do
if i told you a lie?
would you fall to your knees?
or be begging me please?

bridge 1
baby it's a matter of time
can't you see what's on my
mind?

chorus
i wanna get fresh with you baby
i wanna do all the things that
turn you on
i wanna get fresh, get a litte
closer
if it feels so right,
how can it be wrong tonight?
oh baby

if you take a look at the woman at me
i'm a natural thing and i'm wild and free it's up
to you, you can take it or leave it
my mind's made up and you
better believe it
