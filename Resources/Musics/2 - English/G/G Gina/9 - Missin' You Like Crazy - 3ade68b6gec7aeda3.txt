MISSIN' YOU LIKE CRAZY

I wake up to the sound of rain
And as I lie alone
I think about you baby
Since you left nothing's been the same
My life's been upside down
Can't get myself together
I can't even sleep but do the things I always used to do
Maybe it's 'cause I'm missing everything about you
And sometimes at night I turn the radio on
But it's the same sad song
Chorus
I've been missing you like crazy
It's a strain on my heart
Everything I ever lived for has been torn all apart
And baby you know that I never wanted
For us to go on separate ways
(So I keep praying baby that you will come back to me)
Unfortunately for myself
I've been relying on you
To give me all your loving
You said through sickness and through health
That you would never leave me
But maybe I was dreaming
I can't even sleep but do the things I always used to do
Maybe it's 'cause I'm missing everything about you
And sometimes at night I turn the radio on
But it's the same sad song
Chorus
The nights aren't cold but days are lonely and sad (so sad)
And I can't stop thinking 'bout the good times we've shared (You'll
never know)
Baby you'll never know just how much you mean to me
And why I'm missing you, missing you, missing you
Like crazy
Repeat chorus to end
