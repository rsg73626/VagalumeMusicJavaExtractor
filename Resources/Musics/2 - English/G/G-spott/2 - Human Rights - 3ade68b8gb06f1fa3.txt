HUMAN RIGHTS

With the sound of breaking glass
The crashing down
You could not ask
For a second chance
To fight for what you knew
Was always right

With human eyes
To see the light
Your human rights
Can feel tonight

Walking down the streets alone
They thought they would leave you at home
But you gonna fire back
Thereâ€™s no retreat
No walking back

With human eyes
To see the light
Your human rights
Can feel tonight
