SADNESS

I know your sadness
Has got you all alone
You had it
Then you let it go
But don't you think there is no hope at all

Girl, living in your lonesome world
You're thinking if you let yourself go out there
You'll be too scared

But girl, well soon you'll be out of time

Then make up your mind

Boy, you're moving in way too fast
You got to try to make it last somehow
That it will last

Boy, you thought it all was a dream
Love is never what it seems, oh boy
