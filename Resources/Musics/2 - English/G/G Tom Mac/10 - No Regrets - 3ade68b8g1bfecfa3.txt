NO REGRETS

Thunder cracks, the sky is crying
On her back she's pushing, trying
He holds her hand and kneels beside her bed
Break the silence, baby's screaming
In slow motion she ain't dreaming
She closed her eyes, looked up to God and says

Should I cry a little more?
Should I try a little more?
I pay the cost and laugh it off
And do it all a thousand times again
No regrets
