GIVE UP

How could I live? Why would I try?
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot
No giving in or saying goodbye
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing

I won't give up
I won't give upâ€¦no
`Cause you know I won't let you down

How could I live? Why would I try?
I could learn to live without you but I would die
No giving in or saying goodbye
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing
