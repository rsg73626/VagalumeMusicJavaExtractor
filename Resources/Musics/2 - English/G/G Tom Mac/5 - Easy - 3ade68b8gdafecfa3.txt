EASY

Living's hard and dying's easy
My mistakes, they won't defeat me
I like to burn a candle at both ends
I broke some hearts, been broken hearted
Run away from fires I've started
I didn't break but tried my best to bend

Should I cry a little more?
Should I try a little more?
I pay the cost and laugh it off
And do it all a thousand times again
No regrets for things I've done
