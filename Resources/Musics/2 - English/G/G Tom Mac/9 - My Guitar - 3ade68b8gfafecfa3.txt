MY GUITAR

They said it won't last, but they misunderstood
If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock & roll Blame it on the love, blameit on the love

Dad don't understand what the little girls know
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll

All I wanted, all I ever needed
My guitar gave to me
