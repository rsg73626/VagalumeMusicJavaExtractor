A DRUM FOR

I went to see the preacher
To teach me how to pray
He looked at me and smiled
Then the preacher turned away
He said if you want to tell him something
You ain't gotta fold your hands
Say it with your heart
Your soul and believe it
And I'd say amen

Bang a drum for the sinners
Bang a drum for the sins
Bang a drum for the losers
