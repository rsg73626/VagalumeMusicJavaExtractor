HALF

For the delux life and the trump card dream
It could be wonderful
If you only knew what you're wishing for
Is non-refundable
Got to fix some someone with all that
And its typical
They'll never reach your goal

They're only half the page of the story you are
Only half the day to your 24 hours
Like a masquerade in a mardi gras

Why d'you try to get half the truth from the late alibi
Why take only half the moon when you could have the sky?
You can have your skein and the rest is gone

He lives that slow something world on the higher hills
In the higher hills
Where theres no such thing as reality check
On any given thing
When you're so convenient he says he does
But he never will
Give you the love you feel

Hes only half the page of the story you are
Hes only half the day to your 24 hours
Like a masquerade in a mardi gras

Wanna tell you

To get half the truth and the late alibi
Why take only half the moon when you could have the sky?
You can half your skein and the rest is gone

When the drugs wear off her karma's scarred
He'll remember you
In the mirror view
Hes getting bored

Theres a price on everyone that you shouldn't want

Hes only half the page
Only half the day
Like a masquarade in a mardi gras

Wanna tell you

To get half the truth and the late alibi
Why take only half the moon when you could have the sky?
You can half your skein? and the rest is gone

Will he have a clue
Whats up with you?
Better things to do
