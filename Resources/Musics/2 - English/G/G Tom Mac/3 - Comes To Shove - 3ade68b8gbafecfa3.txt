COMES TO SHOVE

No giving in or saying goodbye
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing
(All that's ever left is nothing)

I thought I saw you reach out, thought I saw you try
Waiting here for something, nothing is all I find
Kneeling at your altar, standing on the shore
I'm waiting out, now listen, I'm outside your door

When push comes to shove, it's never enough
It always comes down to something
