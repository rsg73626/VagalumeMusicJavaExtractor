DANNY AND BOBBY

I can still remember
When I was just a kid
When friends were friends forever
And what you said was what you did

Well, it was me and Danny and Bobby
We cut each other's hands
And held tight to a promise
Only brothers understand

But we were so young (so young)
One for all and all for one (for one)
Just as sure as the river's gonna run
