I'LL COME CRASHING

Nothing in my nature tells me
Not to do bad things
I know that I really should be good tonight
There's a kind of satisfaction
That destruction brings
Consequences never could convince me
That I should do right

I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing down
In the ash of a fire that
I built

Mama always told me I should have sense of pride
Daddy always told me how to be a straight up guy
Always tell the truth
And never have a thing to hide
But I'm gonna shoot the moon
And watch it fall from the sky

I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing!
I'll come crashing down
In the ash of a fire that
I built
Nothing matches the passion
And thrill of desired overkills
