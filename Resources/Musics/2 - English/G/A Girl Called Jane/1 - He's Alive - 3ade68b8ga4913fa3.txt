HE'S ALIVE

A rush insides of pain
A feeling you can't explain
Release you from your pain
I got your prescription, babe
Its low, i fill it up
Put butter in your cut
You said you're sick of love
But you aint diein

Everybody clear!
Resesitation,()
Resesitation, breath!
Resesitation,()
He's about to breath,
He's about to give

He's alive, live, live
I feel he's comin through
He's alive, live, live
My baby's pullin thorugh
He's alive!
He is a-live
He's alive!
Ooooaaah!!!
He's alive


He had a heart attack
Bet i can bring him back
Hold up he's goin fast
But i got his prescription, babe
Don't have no vital signs
Pull the plug, no keep on trying
Wont give up, just give me time
Cuz he aint diein!

Everybody clear!

Cuz he don't love me no more
He don't kiss me no more
He don't hold me no more
Like he used to!!! he will still!
