STAY AWAY

It's so hard to be close when I feel this way
Lookin' up at the skies through a wall of gray
When you promised the stars, but all I see is rain

You're messin' up my head with every careless word
Then you come around knowing how to find a cure
My heart can't take another cilvil war

Oohh
I can't take this, but I'll take that kiss
Cause all I know is

You're so good, it's all good
Then you do me wrong
I come back you come back, it's the same old song
I wish we could
We, we, we could
I wish we could stay away
You're so wrong, it's all wrong, then we make up
Try to stand, take a stand, you make it tough
I wish we could. We, we, we could
I wish we could stay away
I wish we could, we, we, we could
I wish we could stay away

It's so hard to love someone like this
Caught in a blizzard now I'm searching for bliss
When I'm away, it's only you that I miss. (yeah)

Wish I could bottle all my feelings, send them' straight to you
At' overnight um cause' they're long overdue, but somehow I can't find the strength to... Ohooho

You're so good, it's all good, then you do me wrong
I come back, you come back
It's the same old song
I wish we could
We, we, we could
I wish we could stay away
You're so wrong, it's all wrong
Then we make up
Try to stand, take a stand, you make it tough
I wish we could
We, we, we could
I wish we could stay away

You're a guitar and I'm a string
Wind me up, you make me sing, but I'm outta tune and your rhythms all wrong
It's so obvious this can never be our song

You're so good, it's all wrong then you do me wrong
I come back, you come back
It's the same old song
I wish we could
We, we, we could
I wish we could stay away
You're so wrong, it's all wrong
Then we make up
Try to stand, take a stand
But, you make it tough
I wish we could
Maybe we could
I wish we could stay away

Ohh
Yeah-e-yeah
Stay away
