WHATEVER, ENJOY YOUR LIFE

Baby you can say goodbye

Tell me what you want, I am not afraid
Look into my eyes and tell me so
Don't try to hide, no need to lie
I just wanna know, why you gotta go

(I know), I guess you got another girl
(I know), your love for me has faded away
(you know) still you can't seem to let me go

Baby you can say goodbye
Turn away just walk away
Baby you can let me go
Cause being with me hurts me more
All the love you gave me, you can take it back
All your love? just take it back
I am not gonna shed another tear, just gonna let you go

Yup, shawty my sweety nal tteona gandaneun ne ibsul-I
Oneulttala wae ili wonmangseuleowo boineun ji
( neol butjab-ayahaneunde ) mal-I naojileul anh-a
Neon imi meol-eo jineunde

(I know) our memories will fade away
(I know) you won't even look my way
(you know) deep down inside, I'm holding on

Baby you can say goodbye
Turn away, just walk away
Baby you can let me go
Cause being with me hurts me more
All the love you gave me, you can take it back
All your love? just take it back
I am not gonna shed another tear, just gonna let you go.

(you) don't forget about our love
(you) the one and only I had was you
Every reason for my life was you, my baby
(why) did you make me believe you
(why) and the love that was so true
Falling apart?. what should I do
This is all that's left of me

Baby please don't say goodbye
Tell me that it's all a dream
Baby please don't let me go
Loving you was everything

Hoping you'd remember all the time we shared
There's just nothing to compare
I am not gonna shed another tear, just gotta let you go

Oh oh oh oh oh
Tell me baby tell me please
Oh oh oh oh oh
No no no no
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby I'll just say goodbye
