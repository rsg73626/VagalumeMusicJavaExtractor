ONE STEP AHEAD

How many times
Did I miss the signs?
My stupid heart
It left me blind

Nobody else would forgive my mistakes
Nobody else would've stayed

One step ahead of me
You saw what we could be
How did you know
Down in your bones
That I'd come around?

One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see
What this could mean
But I see it now
I see it now

How could I
Ever be enough?
Worthy of
Someone else's love?

All of my hang-ups and all of my fears
You made them all disappear

One step ahead of me
You saw what we could be
How did you know
Down in your bones
That I'd come around?

One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see
What this could mean
But I see it now
I see it now
