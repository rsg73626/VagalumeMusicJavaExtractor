HOLD EACH OTHER (FEAT. FUTURISTIC)

I miss the words we used to say
I miss the sounds of yesterday
I miss the games we used to play like ohh
I was trapped inside a dream
I couldn't see her next to me
I didn't know she'd set me free like ohh

Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short
And the nights get a little bit colder
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Hmm hmm

Everything looks different now
All this time my head was down
He came along and showed me how to let go
I can't remember where I'm from
All I know is who I've become
That our love has just begun like ohh

Something happens when I hold him
He keeps my heart from getting broken
When the days get short
And the nights get a little bit frozen
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Hmm hmm

Yo
If I'm stressing, you that blessing
That's sent from heaven
These days start to feel like hours
And hours feel more like seconds
People judged us they couldn't see the connection
When I look at you
It's like I'm looking back at my reflection
I don't see nothing different
Our pigments they coincide
We hold each other so tight
They couldn't break us if they tried
My eyes are those of the blind
I see no color or size
I feel the love in your touch
And I trust what's inside your mind
Ok

I know that we've been through a lot
I know that we both grew up
You know I missed you a lot
When I was young I was dumb
Didn't think you'd fit in my plot
And I appreciate the break
Because I love what we got
Now

You give me chills
And I can't imagine you leaving
If I could build a perfect person
Honestly you would be it
And you know nobody knows you
Like I know you
I can't wait to come back home
So I can hold you

Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short
And the nights get a little bit colder
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Hmm hmm

We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Hmm hmm
