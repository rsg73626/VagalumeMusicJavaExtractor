HOLD EACH OTHER

(hold...)
(hold...)
(each other...)

I miss the words we used to say
I miss the sounds of yesterday
I miss the games we used to play like ohh
I was trapped inside a dream
I couldn't see her next to me
I didn't know she'd set me free like ohh

Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short
And the nights get a little bit colder
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Mm

Everything looks different now
All this time my head was down
He came along and showed me how to let go
I can't remember where I'm from
All I know is who I've become
That our love has just begun like ohh

Something happens when I hold him
He keeps my heart from getting broken
When the days get short
And the nights get a little bit frozen
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Mm

(hold...)
(hold...)
(hold...)
(hold...)
(each other...)

Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short
And the nights get a little bit colder
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Mm
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other
Mm
