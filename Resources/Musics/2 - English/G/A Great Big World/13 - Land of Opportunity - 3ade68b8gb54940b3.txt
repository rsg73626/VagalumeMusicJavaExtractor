LAND OF OPPORTUNITY

I'm sailing away
To a land of opportunity
The sun will shine
The birds will sing there everyday
I'm sailing away
And I hope that you remember me
It was fun
We had our run
Hip hip hooray

You said Hello
I loved you so
Just like in a movie scene
I want you to know
I had to let it go
I'm falling in love again

I'm running away
To a place where you won't bother me
We won't talk for awhile
We'll be okay
And I'm changing my name
To a word that's really hard to say
It's no one's fault
I'm just too young and you're insane

I wasted my time
I missed all the signs
And it ruined my holiday
I want you to know I had to let go
I'm falling in love again

I just gotta believe there's something better
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me
I just gotta believe, I just gotta believe

You said Hello
I loved you so
I felt like a kid again
I want you to know
I had to let go
I'm falling in love again

I just gotta believe there's something better
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me
I just gotta believe, I just gotta believe

I'm sailing away to a land of opportunity
