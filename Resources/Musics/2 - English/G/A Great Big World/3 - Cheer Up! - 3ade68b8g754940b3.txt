CHEER UP!

Cheer up!
'Cos nothing really matters
when you look up into outer space
It's a great big world and there's no need to cry

Cheer up!
We're all interconnected to the reaches of the galaxy
And my best friend said he came from the sky
He travelled to The Earth aboard a pink spaceship
it's hard for him to hide behind those eyes

Cheer up!
The atoms in your body are as old as every dinosaur
You're a special part of one bring grand design

Cheer up!
We're all in this together to discover what we're living for
13 billion years and there's still time

Every night I wish upon the star so bright
waiting for the others to arrive

Cheer up!
'Cos nothing really matters
when you look up into outer space

It's a great big world and there's no need to cry
13 billion years and there's still time
