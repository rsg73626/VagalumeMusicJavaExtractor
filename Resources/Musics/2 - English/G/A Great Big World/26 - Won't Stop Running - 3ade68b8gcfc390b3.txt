WON'T STOP RUNNING

Facing forward
Lights out
I won't stop running
Falling backwards
Hands tied
I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
This isn't over
I am way too young and I won't stop running

I don't know how much longer I can fake it
That it's all alright, that I can do this alone
And I know that life is what you make it
But it's hard to see stars 
When you're always caught in the folds

Every night in my mind it's a fight
But I won't stop dreaming
'Cause this isn't over
It's never over

Facing forward
Lights out
I won't stop running
Falling backwards
Hands tied
I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
This isn't over
I am way too young and I won't stop running

I'd rather be the one that starts the fire
Than to shut my mouth and be the one who gets burned
Yeah "it is what it is, " but I wanna go higher
'Cause I felt it once before
I believe the tables will turn

I wanna love and be the one who is loved
No I won't stop dreaming
'Cause this isn't over
It's never over
