SHORTY DON'T WAIT

Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til' the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait until your life goes by

When your heart don't feel like dancin'
I'll be there to give you mine
And when you lose that happy feeling
I will lift your spirits high

So, Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til' the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait until your life goes by

And all those people who have hurt you
Well they ain't worth your precious time
And when there's no one you can turn too
I'll be right there by your side

Shorty don't wait in line
Short don't wait til' the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait until your life goes by

So take that weight off of your shoulders
So you can rest your head on mine
And when you feel like starting over
Well don't think twice yeah it's alright, yeah it's alright (Oh)

Shorty don't wait in line
Short don't wait til' the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait until your life goes by

Shorty don't wait in line
Short don't wait til' the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait until your life goes by
