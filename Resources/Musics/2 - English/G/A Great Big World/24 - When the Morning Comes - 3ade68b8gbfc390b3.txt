WHEN THE MORNING COMES

What happened before
Was a waste of time
I don't care anymore
I wanna move on
There is so much more
Than who's right or who's wrong

Oh oh oh
We can shake it
Oh oh oh
Let the pieces fall
Oh oh oh
We can take it
I believe
I believe
I believe

When the lights go out
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
And the war is done
You will hear my heart beating

It happened so fast
The way it tore right through
Can't erase what has passed
But we're still alive
In a world that
Wants to keep us inside

Oh oh oh
We can shake it
Oh oh oh
And let the pieces fall
Oh oh oh
We're gonna make it
I believe
I believe
I believe

When the lights go out
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
And the war is done
You will hear my heart beating
