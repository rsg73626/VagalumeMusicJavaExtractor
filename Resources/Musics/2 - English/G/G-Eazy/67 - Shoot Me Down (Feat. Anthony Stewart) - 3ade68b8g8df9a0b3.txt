SHOOT ME DOWN (FEAT. ANTHONY STEWART)

Yeah, I may be right, I may be wrong
But you gonna miss me when I'm gone
I'm modern johnny cash and june
We've never got along!
Just think about me when you play this song
I'm making on, just watch!
You'll be so regretful, and revenge is when I get
Quickly then, I just forget you!
But I can't even tell a lie
Felt like you were special
Till I realize what's up and left
Got you feeling dreadful
So whether not you meant to
Ain't no difference between it
Cause everything we had
Is gone now you can't redeem it
Can't tell if you're oblivious
Or if you really mean it
I wonder just how many other folks
Before me seen it
But that shit love can make you blind
To a lot of shit
But I can't waste my time
On this right now I gotta split
We got shot up until you start to pop
Then you did some shit I never would have done!

Never thought you'd shoot me down, down, down
I raise my body from the ground, ground, ground
But I'm not worried here at all, no, no
I get right back up when I fall, you know

Catching shots from head to toe (head to toe)
I need no medic, though
A modern gatsby chasing daisy, I should have let it go
But you never know!
I might have dreamed too high, rather way too low
Cause you wouldn't stick around
Back when I was making dough
Do you see a poster with my face
For me to play a show?
And your friends are like
'he made it now! ' fuck the way to go!
Used to dream about becoming rich
You ain't see the vision
I ain't make it fast enough
For you so you ain't sticking with him
I used to think about a life
With you and music I was wishing
For them both but you ain't see
It 'till I brought one to fruition
But for some reason now
And then I still consider
The what if's and the maybes
But that shit just makes me bitter
See, we had a shot
Up until you start to pop
But you did some shit
I never would have thought

I never thought you'd shoot me down, down, down
I raise my body from the ground, ground, ground
But I'm not worried here at all, no, no
I get right back up when I fall, you know
Never thought you'd shoot me down, down, down
I raise my body from the ground, ground, ground
But I'm not worried here at all, no, no
I get right back up when I fall, you know
