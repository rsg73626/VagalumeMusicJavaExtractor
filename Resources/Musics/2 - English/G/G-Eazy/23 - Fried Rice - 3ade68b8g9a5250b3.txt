FRIED RICE

These girls wanna tie a kid down
and keep me around
But I would never change; I'm a dog, I'm a hound
But I told them what they wanna hear
They like how it sounds
Tell them I'm gone with the wind
And I'm lost, never found
I met her at my show, then we smashed right after
If we go three rounds
Then she'll fall in love faster
The very next morning I'm Casper
In another city for a show
Somewhere getting plastered
It's a disaster; to her I'm a drug
I do her kinda dirt
But they still fall in love
And I don't understand it
Foreign chicks on me
And she speak another language
Like she from a different planet
She struggle when I'm gone
It's hard when I leave
Being Ricky Pen, wear my heart on my sleeve
And she tell me that she love me
But it's hard to believe
Cuz I'm coming and going
then I cum then I leave
And I swear I'm really not that shady
But you can't blame me
For who I've met lately
Nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
As soon as they find out I rap, shit's crazy
But I do play along, yo I can't front
I give in to every groupie with a fat butt
London to Japan
Hong Kong to Iran
Chicks say I'm the man

What that bitch say?
What that bitch say?

And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
