BUT A DREAM

Legendary swag, young god, stay trippin'
Spillin' champagne on a boat, big pimpin'
Life is but a dream, look bitch, stop trippin'
You know what it is, you know what it isn't
She just get it poppin' every time daddy visits
Drinking by the pool
Go ahead and take a dip in
Life is but a dream, we livin', stop trippin'
You know what it is, you know what it isn't

I really put the work in
Don't you ever try to play me
I would die a legend if today they jfk'd me
Ridin' in my '65 listening to amy
I've been to hell and back
And through it all remained the same me
I never gave a fuck
A million dollars couldn't change me
As long as mark zuckerberg's
Still got that zipped hoodie
I think about the journey
And think what it did to me
I'm eating like a king
Until I've got a big tummy
Hair slicked backwards with a skin fade taper
Captain save-a-hoe, never I, can't save her
She said I drive her mad
Gerald's rap's don draper
All day I touch paper
Bitch don't ask me no favors
If you wasn't here before it
Your calls, I ignore it
How quickly they forgive
These days I swear I can't support it
Six-hundred horsepower
I just hop inside and floor it
The money, I adore it
Every year I'm getting more lit

Legendary swag, young god, stay trippin'
Spillin' champagne on a boat, big pimpin'
Life is but a dream, look bitch, stop trippin'
You know what it is, you know what it isn't
She just get it poppin'
Every time daddy visits
Drinking by the pool
Go ahead and take a dip in
Life is but a dream, we livin', stop trippin'
You know what it is, you know what it isn't

She just so bad, make you take a second look
I fly out for a week
She just come to fuckin' cook
And pose by the pool
With her feet up, read a book
I text her l. a., that was all it took
She clicks her heels three times
She'll be here by tonight
I text my travel agent name and birthday
It's a flight
When we was broke
I used to tell my moms we'd be alright
I'm gonna work the long nights
And never be a fly-by-night
I put my plans in motion
I fly across the ocean
I popped before the flight
So I could see her dreams in motion
And I be out in london
Noble street, I goes in
Fuck that after-party money
Spent that on some clothing
And I'm not trying to flex
I know I shouldn't be hatin'
This is for my little bruhs
Just some inspiration
Everybody back off, first is motivation
So go and get the money
Get the dreams, keep on chasing

Legendary swag, young god, stay trippin'
Spillin' champagne on a boat, big pimpin'
Life is but a dream, look bitch, stop trippin'
You know what it is, you know what it isn't
She just get it poppin' every time daddy visits
Drinking by the pool
Go ahead and take a dip in
Life is but a dream, we livin', stop trippin'
You know what it is, you know what it isn't
