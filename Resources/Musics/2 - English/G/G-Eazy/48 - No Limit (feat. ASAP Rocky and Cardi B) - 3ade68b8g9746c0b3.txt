NO LIMIT (FEAT. ASAP ROCKY AND CARDI B)

[Chorus: A$Ap Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, aye, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with G and get some money

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
No limit, I'm a fucking soldier, aye
Always lit, yeah, I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rocks
she act like it's a boulder, aye
'Rari, shopping, let me, cop it
Always, poppin', hella, poppin'
She's a, bopper, homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping, album, dropping
Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired
I might have to fuck around and call Kamaiyah
Hoe stirring up the pot, jambalaya
Young Gerald

[Chorus: A$Ap Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: Cardi B]
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money, yeah
Fuck him then I get some money

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
I need tongue, I need face, give me brain, concentrate
Apple phone, Prada case, kill a weave, rock a lace
Fuck the Moe, buy the Ace, fuck the Ghost
drive the Wraith
Get some money, flood the Rollie
fuck the Rollie, Patek face
My career takin' off, these hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth
how these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs? Bitch, I ain't Jared
If you really want some smoke
you can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make a nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Saz√≥n, I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club 'til the end from the spot
You know me, Cardi B
Pussy poppin' on the charts, ah, ah!

[Chorus: A$Ap Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, aye, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with G and get some money

[Chorus: A$Ap Rocky]
Hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, aye, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Aye, yeah, fuck with G and get some money
