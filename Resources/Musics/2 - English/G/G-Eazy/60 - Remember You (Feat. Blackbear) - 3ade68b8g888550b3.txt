REMEMBER YOU (FEAT. BLACKBEAR)

I will remember you!
She got her own crib with a twin bed,
In West Hollywood.
She uptown, and she danced to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around!
I will remember you!
I will remember you!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back when the first time we met
I was thinking about sex, but you told me not yet
I meant no disrespect, I was just being honest, my only regret was
Never letting you know how I felt or what was up
That was too much Maker's in my cup
I was faded, too fucked up
And you probably think I'm an asshole
Read your facial expression. 
But it's not every day someone comes and leaves an impression
Typing shit to say to you then deleting it on my phone 
When I'm texting,
Cause I still be thinking about you like every day, no question, but 
I ain't really trying to fly out, and I'm no good at phones
And my life is on the road, I'm with the crew of Rolling Stones, 
But don't trip

Cause I still remember you!
She got her own crib with a twin bed,
In West Hollywood.
She uptown, and she danced to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around!
I will remember you!
I will remember you!

See, I got this tendency to fall in love too quickly, 
But it's usually a phase I fall into in every city
That passes away instantly, when I leave is over,
I come to my senses when I'm sober, yeah!
But I thought about you, no lie
When I left, you stayed on my brain
Then we finally got to fuck, and that shit was all the way insane
Now I know that you're having a thought
Picture us having a spot!
But look at this baggage I got
My life is crazy, I travel a lot, but 
When I dip out in the morning you can trust
I'll be thinking about you looking out the window of my bus

Cause I still remember you!
She got her own crib with a twin bed,
In West Hollywood.
She uptown, and she danced to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around!
I will remember you!
I will remember you!
