LEGEND

Yeah
I'm back drinking whiskey

(I-I)
Needed a reason to go off I think I found one
(I think I found one!)
Don't know what legend
Is until you been around one (been around one!)
We poppin' champagne on a jet
Think I been wildin' (you're wild!)
Bottle after bottle
I just drank a gallon (yee! yee!)
Since I was young they say
That boy he got some talent (he does!)
I put some gold up on my teeth
And my medallion (bling!)
My favorite time of day
The name my second album (yeah)
The sun go down it's like a monster
Just came out him
Yeah

I just wanna chill and tuck off with a bad one
Man, y'all be stressing me
Ah, fuck I need a valium
I remember when I first made thirty thousand
And now I spent that on some dinner
Eat italian (linguine!)
We really did it, bruh
We came up from the bottom
It's what is, I swear I see it how I call it
I swear you're lookin' like a l
You're not far from it
And I just go into the booth and then I vomit
The neighbors knocking
All complaining bout the volume
I bought the house
Bitch I don't understand the problem
They bite the swag off
Stealing juice, I swear they robbin'
I swear my lifestyle '97 dennis rodman

(I-I)
Needed a reason to go off
I think I found one (I think I found one!)
Don't know what legend
Is until you been around one (been around one!)
We poppin' champagne on a jet
Think I been wildin' (you're wild!)
Bottle after bottle

I put some gold up on my teeth
And my medallion (bling!)
My favorite time of day
The name my second album (yeah)
The sun go down it's like a monster
Just came out him
Yeah

I just want to pull off
In that testarossa (vroom!)
I just sent a text
And then that bitch came over (hi!)
Man, I be faded, faded
Rarely am I sober (I'm gone!)
And you ain't got it
You a muthafuckin' poser (bitch!)
She wanna fuck, eeh, I'm not mad at it
It's all right there
Man, you just gotta go and grab it (yah!)
I text I want her
Then I fly her like aladdin (woo!)
But if she ain't the baddest
Then I put her in [?] (sorry)
They follow me at the party, I walk around it
Like: is it me
Or did this room just get crowded? (fuck off)
And they's some sixes up in here
Like who allowed in? (who?)
She thinks she's got a chance
I really fuckin' doubt it

(I-I)
Needed a reason to go off
