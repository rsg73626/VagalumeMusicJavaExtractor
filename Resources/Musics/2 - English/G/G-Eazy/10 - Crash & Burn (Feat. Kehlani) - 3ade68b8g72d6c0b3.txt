CRASH & BURN (FEAT. KEHLANI)

Live each day like it's your last
''cause you never feel the moment till it's passed
(hitmaka!)
Oh-oh
Time just keeps on ticking fast (you know?)
Know, there's danger in the lesson learned
Slow down before you crash & burn

These my day-ones I'm surrounded by
So everyone you see me with is down to ride
These girls be goin' crazy
When they see the life
And I be selling dreams
I know she's down to buy
The voices in my head tell me
I should be honest
But I don't pay attention
I don't hear their comments (yeah)
And it's bananas what I spend on diamonds
Understand me
This is cut from nothing economics
Living to the maximum
All these checks I'm cashing 'em
''cause this could disappear quicker
Than how fast it comes
And I'm so high I'm numb
Living fast, I'm lapping 'em
Liquor, drugs, and sex addiction
I'm all of 'em wrapped in one
See me hoppin' in a wraith
Putting 15 million in a safe
Mama called on my birthday
Like "hallelujah! 28
You made it out of 27 safe"

Live each day like it's your last
(like it's your last)
''cause you never feel the moment
Till it's passed
(you never know it till it's gone, yeah)
Oh-oh
Time just keeps on ticking fast (you know?)
Know, there's danger in the lesson learned
Slow down before you crash & burn
Oh-oh (yeah)
Oh-oh (you know)
Better, slow down before you crash & burn
(yeah)

Never lose control, but I get close to it
Live in the moment
I'm just tryna make the most of it
The other night I swear
I took down the baddest bitch
I passed out, she snuck a pic
And she posted it
That makes a hundred problems
I just counted it
Everything's authentic, this ain't counterfit
I'm just tryna make my mama proud of it
Stay in control up until you spiral out of it
Living fast as freeways
I ain't slept in three days
Making money three ways
Keep on running these plays
And I don't need praise, I need more paid days
Need more vacays, never took the safe way
I'm living like the villain does
They say karma's coming 'round
But until it does
Imma do these drugs till I feel a buzz
I ain't slowing down, I'm tryna live it up

Live each day like it's your last
(like it's your last)
''cause you never feel the moment
Till it's passed
(you never know it till it's gone, yeah)
Oh-oh
Time just keeps on ticking fast (you know?)
Know, there's danger in the lesson learned
Slow down before you crash & burn
Oh-oh (yeah)
Oh-oh (you know)
Better slow down before you crash & burn
