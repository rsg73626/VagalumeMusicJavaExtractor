EAZY (FEAT. SON LUX)

Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone
(yeah)
Easy, easy (talkin' to my younger self)
Pull out your heart to make the being alone

Dear gerald, you're fourteen years
And a truant
You're trying to find your place
And figure out where you fit
You're finna start rappin'
With a kid you went to school with
But, more on that later
Right now you're going through it
See, you're going to have to prove
That you ain't soft and you're not stupid
And you gon' have to scrap
With some kids that you ain't cool with
You got a short temper
Just be careful when you lose it
You wanna be the man
But it's gon' take some time to prove it
You'll fall in love
But she's gon' break your heart
And put you through it
Fuck falling for that bullshit
You gon' fall in love with music
You're finna get arrested
Almost fuck around and lose it
Spend days in juvy standing at the window
Looking through it
Nothing in life is promised
Not even free-time is
So, only chase dreams, and only chase commas
Won't happen on its own
Trust, trust, we've been through it

If it was easy, everyone would do it
This game is not

Easy, easy (eazy)
Pull out your heart to make the being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone

I mean, I was fucking up
I was seventeen, I was eighteen
Just doing dumb shit
My moms made me move to new orleans and shit
I went to school down there on a scholarship
I finally got my shit together
I started taking music seriously
Then it started to kinda pop off a little bit
Almost

Dear gerald, 21
You think you've got it figured out
Got a big head from them labels
Trying to bring you out
'til they passed on you
They ain't see what they was missing out
On, that flight home gave you
Some shit to think about
Scrambling trying to figure out
Went back to the drawing board
Know they say rejection's
Only supposed to make you want it more
But, no lie, you contemplating quitting
Walking out the door
But, what the fuck you supposed to do?
This is all you're living for
Really it was that and dev
That was all you had
Paying rent by engineering other rappers
At the pad
Barely getting by, hella broke
You was doing bad
Then "these things happened"
You finally seen a bag
You drove down the highway
A fork in the road
A normal life with her, or going for broke?
I seen an open lane
And I drove straight through it

If it was easy, everyone would do it
This game is not

Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone

I literally sold all my shit
I moved out of my place in new orleans
I was bouncing around
Living out of a suitcase
Crashing on friends' couches
Living at air b&bs and hotels
Trying to make the album
Trying to make when it's dark out
If I could take it there, that'd be great

Dear gerald, life changed
Since you dropped your second album
And me, myself & I just went 7x platinum
Toured around the world
Damn, you really had 'em
But now you're 27 and it's time to be a legend
Back when it all started
Grinding hard on that promo tour
Tired from the night before
And the night before and the night before
Fuck it, tomorrow, gotta fly some more
Don't complain, this is what you signed up for
You're working for your family
Managers, agents
They all want something different from you
Tell them all patience
But, this one's on you
The lonely quest of greatness
Been trying to be famous
Been trying to be a-list
When you arrive
It will appear as if there's nothing to it
But, you planted the seeds and you grew it
There's people taking credit
For success that they had nothing to do with

If it was easy, everyone would do it
This game is not

Easy, easy (eazy)
Pull out your heart to make the being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone

So now you're here
What you gon' do with it?
You know?

Make no mistake
Listen it's the life that I was chosen for
All I prayed for was an open door
I've been rich, I've been broke before
I've seen the floor
You try to put me in a box
I'll box out like okafor
And fuck being indecisive now I'm so for sure
And fuck trump
It's like "what the fuck we voted for? "
And most of y'all should
Probably party less and focus more
And if that line resonates
You're probably who I wrote it for
Where will I go from here? "idk"
They want me to architect rome, in a day
Juice knew I was greatness
When he looked at me
Right away
I've made platinum records
That'll never see the light of day
This is what the whole world's been waiting for
The crowd's jumping
Going dumb till they break the floor
Come take a walk inside my mind
Come and take a tour
I'm really not playing
What the fuck you take me for?

Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the being alone
Easy
Easy
Easy
