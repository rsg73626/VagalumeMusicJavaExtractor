CHARLES BROWN (FEAT. E-40, JAY ANT)

Trying to know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know

Sometimes I gotta be dolo alone
Just walkin' around
Young gerald, young charlie brown
Some shit's better to keep to yourself
Than say aloud
Some shit you see and they don't
So I simply jot it down
It was written
Had the vision as a youth
That I would make it here one day
A flight to the top, cop a one-way
But looking out the window on the subway
16, Slapping mac dre
Somehow I always knew it'd be that way
I felt this so clear
It's like a rode a time machine and I saw it
I paint the picture and draw it
I fold it up in my wallet
Keep it with me everywhere
I go just as a reminder
Told myself every time
I get discouraged or tired
I got greatness inside of me
I go against the greats until they tired of me
I've heard it all, nothing surprises me
See, I'm the one, I'm the anomaly
But never mind me
I'll just be up over here killing 'em quietly
You know?

Trying to know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know

Yeah, and I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised, tomorrow or today
From the bay, like 40 and dre
So Imma do it in a major way
I said, I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised, tomorrow or today
From the bay, like 40 and dre
Chasing dreams, it's the only way

I'm still here, remember these lyrics
And when I'm dead and gone
I'll be there in spirit
Don't let 'em run my name in the mud
Don't let 'em smear it
Just pour some rossi out
Go ahead and tear it
One of a kind, no copy
Tell your grandchildren's children 'bout me
Tell 'em I was the illest
Let 'em know I spit the realest
Went from pennies and nickels to large amounts
Kept it in the hood, where it counts
Never was them, always was him
Had to prove myself, time and time again
Just when they thought it was it
He back with another hit
We brought the bay
To the rest of the world (who was it?)
E-40 and gerald

Trying to know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know

So where I go from here?
I did the most you could
Possibly pack into a year
Now I can either fall off
And completely disappear
Or, I can move up to the highest tier
Conversations with gerald
Standing in front the mirror
Ask myself like "fuck the bullshit
What you really fear? "
We all want to be understood
Hope they hear us clear
But that shit never happens everywhere
So I just do me on my "fuck the world" shit
I'm riding through the town
Listening to earl's shit
Been trying to lift the bay up
I could probably curl it
I learn from the legends
They tell me "you're it"
So I always maintain and try to stay sane
But, just do you, give a fuck what they sayin'
We artists are all alike
We feel the same pain
You want the whole world?
You want the same thing

Trying to know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know
