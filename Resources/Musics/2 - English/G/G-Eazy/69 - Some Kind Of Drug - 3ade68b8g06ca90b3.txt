SOME KIND OF DRUG

Wake up this morning thinking I can't be still girl
Too many images just running through my mind
Soon as I hit it, I kick it right out of my system
Even my brother just asked me what you want

I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night
Girl come through, that bath water running
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Girl come through, champagne be popping
System be knocking in my hotel room

Ever since I met you, got me changing my schedule
If you ain't know, that shits eventful
And losing this money is dreadful, but
Believe me, that pussy is special
You wanted me meet moms, I might let you
Rollie is soo presidential, keep it on while we fuck that's cause I meant to, yeah
Fuck you twice, we take a nap, soon as you're awake, get back
Go for three and takes a nack
I'm taking you to places that
You ain't been girl, face the fact, meant it, I can't take it back
Whisky straight, ain't chasing that, I'll taste the cat, yeah
Yeah, you told me I own that pearl, yeah, that's cause I bone you girl
You should be my only girl, when I hit it, you feel like you own the world

I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night
Girl come through, that bath water running
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Girl come through, champagne be popping
System be knocking in my hotel room

Since the last time we had sex, honestly, I've been a mess, well
Fienin cause you got the best, borderline kind of obsessed and yeah
I've been on some kind of drug, I've been addicted and I cannot find enough
I call you, I'm tryna fuck, I'm in room 921, come on up
And we could put up the "please do not disturb"
I got drink, I got the herb, I'm tweakin', now I must be cured
The only way I rest assured is if... I get my fix
I love the way your dress just slips right off your waist, right down your hips
Technique's the best, she knows some tricks and yeah
I need you now, I need you bad
You and me both of us been fienin' bad, I guess what I really mean is that... Yeah

I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night
Girl come through, that bath water running
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Girl come through, champagne be popping
System be knocking in my hotel room
