REWIND (FT. ANTHONY RUSSO)

Hitmaka

I can't take you blowin' up my line
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind
We might have to rewind (ohh)
I can't take you blowin' up my line
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind (uh)
We might have to rewind (yeah)

Good vibes only
Can't be held back for nothing, no ties on me
I'm tryna be as big as Pac, all eyes on me
And why you sayin' we're together?
You're just my homie, fall back
Be kind and rewind
Let's backtrack, I need time
I need some good weed and me time
I hit you with peace sign, no cat, no feline
I say how I feel, I might have to resign
And quit this, you so suspicious
Made you the one, you still trippin' off bitches
If this was '06 I'd go bag with the quickness
It's time to admit this ain't work out, no fitness like (yeah)

I can't take you blowin' up my line
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind
We might have to rewind (ohh)
I can't take you blowin' up my line
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind (yeah)
We might have to rewind (yeah)

Every single night she wants some more of me (ayy)
I'ma have to curve with some authority (ayy)
Bringin' hella drama you ignoring me
Know what's good only if I invited you cordially (ayy)
Plus you always mad for the majority
Of the time we spend together, that ain't how it's supposed to be
Once you got close with me, you kept on tryna pose with me
Post it on the gram, you just tryna flex socially (ayy)
It's a vibe, be careful it's a lie
Always strapped, she might shoot a bullet in a vibe
And lately it's been feelin' like it happens every time
You fuckin' up my high, shit I might have to rewind like

I can't take you blowin' up my line (yeah)
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind
We might have to rewind
I can't take you blowin' up my line
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind
We might have to rewind

You make time (you make time)
For what you like (what you like, yeah)
You switched sides (haa-aa-aa-aa) (uh, ayy)
Gotta free myself
You say you don't need my help
Say she wanna be selfish
You can do it by yourself

I can't take you blowin' up my line (I can't)
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind
We might have to rewind
I can't take you blowin' up my line
Fuckin' up my vibe every night
Look at this back and forth shit
We might have to rewind
We might have to rewind
