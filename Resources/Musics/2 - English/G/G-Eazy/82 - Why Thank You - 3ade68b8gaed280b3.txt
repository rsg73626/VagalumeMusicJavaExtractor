WHY THANK YOU

Yeah, that's perfect

Feeling better than I ever felt
Feeling better than I ever felt
Why thank you
Feeling better than I ever felt
Feeling better than I ever felt
Meanwhile these dead presidents keep coming
I'ma stack this
Wanna play in the big leagues kid practice
Live the lifestyle wife a model or an actress
Oh I'm so damn good at this
Muahahaha

Money straight, like the way I drink bourbon
There's no one like me stop searchin'
You can go and bet the house on it I'm a sure thing
You've been working for a while something's not working
Wait for me to fail then you got the wrong person
I am not an earthling, aliens birthed him
Crazy and disturbing
Belong in an insane asylum Gerald's going crazy wilding
But who cares? His paper's piling
I'll go vacation on my favorite island take a valium
Kidnap Hit-Boy and lock him up and make an album
Could make a hundred new songs fuck it, make a thousand
Never drop it, fuck the world I'll be straight without them
Listen, cause low key, like two octaves down
Somewhere along the road became a monster now
Toured the world and I brought the town
We're eating plenty food over here we got lots around

I am feeling better than I ever felt
Feeling better than I ever felt
Why thank you
Feeling better than I ever felt
Feeling better than I ever felt
Meanwhile these dead presidents keep coming
I'ma stack this
Wanna play in the big leagues kid practice
Live the lifestyle wife a model or an actress
Oh I'm so damn good at this
Muahahaha

At 15 I was on the struggle bus
25 on another bus, with a couple sluts
Whole team's good
now there's nothing that could trouble us
Rolling up extendo blunts light the double dutch
Nobody can fuck with us you'd be quick to fail
The game's not for everybody pick a different trail
They wanna talk business well, I'm checking my avail
Whole tour is sold out there's not a ticket left for sale
We came a long way from fifty people at the shows
To crashing shit, at fashion week models getting chose
My table's full of hoes, you got a table full of bros
Damn, ain't know you was one of those
You might resemble clowns
if you ever tried stepping in his shoe
So, show respect is something you should definitely do
It's no surprise I'm on got a bedroom with a view
I'm just saying this is everything we said that we would do

I am feeling better than I ever felt
Feeling better than I ever felt
Why thank you
Feeling better than I ever felt
Feeling better than I ever felt
Meanwhile these dead presidents
keep coming I'ma stack this
Wanna play in the big leagues kid practice
Live the lifestyle wife a model or an actress
Oh I'm so damn good at this
Muahahaha
