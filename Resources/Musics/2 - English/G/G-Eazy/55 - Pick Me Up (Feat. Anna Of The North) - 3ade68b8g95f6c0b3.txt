PICK ME UP (FEAT. ANNA OF THE NORTH)

Uh, yeah
Cocaine clouds, eyelids peeled
Thirty thousand feet, up's how it feels
Homemade straws, hundred dollar bills
Overflowing cups, 'till the glass fills
Looking down on the earth, marijuana fields
Uh, synthesize capsules and pills
Hollywood castles, the hills
Do it all, wonder will we live
Past the thrills?
Yeah, pay the prices for a nice trip
Yeah, vices got me in a vice grip
And... I don't... even care if I live
Wonder... if... if I will ever

If you come hit it once, be careful now
(be careful now)
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
'cause baby once you (baby once you)
'cause baby once you (baby once you)
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down

You know, uh
My personality's addicted to it, ugh
Pick up a habit and I'm stickin' to it
Yeah, I tell my story and they listen to it
Jackson pollock, paint a picture
See my vision through it
Yeah, when she hit me, I'll be there again
I swear that pussy's like heroin
Used rubbers, dirty sheets, at the sheraton
Check your pockets for them drugs
You been carrying
Uh, hope you got something for the come down
The sun's been up, hey let's roll a blunt now
Too much yey, it's no fun now
We all need limits, gotta learn how

If you come hit it once, be careful now
(be careful now)
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
'cause baby once you (baby once you)
'cause baby once you (baby once you)
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down

I live without consequences
When I play with death, I display talent
Outta' cash buying drugs, can I paypal it?
Don't talk about it, she'd just stay silent
The beautiful & damned
Tryna find balance, yeah
She wants molly, she wants all that
I call once and then I call back
If my dealer don't respond back
The whole world's going all black
Yeah, can't handle her, she's out her head
Yeah, and then she looked at me
And then she said
"I hope you make it in heaven for a half hour"
Yeah, before the devil finds out you're dead

If you come hit it once, be careful now
(be careful now)
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
'cause baby once you (baby once you)
'cause baby once you (baby once you)
'cause baby once you pick me up
You can't pull me down
