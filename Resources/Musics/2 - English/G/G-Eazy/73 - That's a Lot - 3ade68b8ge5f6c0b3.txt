THAT'S A LOT

Said ooh, that's a lot, lot
Look at them bands, that's a lot, lot
Like, ooh, we don't stop, stop
Count it up, that's a lot, lot
Like, hey, that's a lot!
Cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that's a lot, lot
Count it up, that's a lot, lot

Cake, cake, cake
I'm laughing the whole way to the bank
I just take, take, take
Sweeping up this cash, I need a rake
I'm the captain out here, pulling rank
Clap that ass, give it a spank
Going aye, aye, aye
Shit, play this
My face look like something stank
This shit is [?]
I'm courtside, I can't switch seats
Model chick weighs 95
I don't know what this bitch eats
The homie hit it, I hit it too
The head's great, the pussy's cool
She fell in love off three fucks
Like got damn, that's pitiful

Said ooh, that's a lot, lot
Look at them bands, that's a lot, lot
Like, ooh, we don't stop, stop
Count it up, that's a lot, lot
Like, hey, that's a lot!
Cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that's a lot, lot
Count it up, that's a lot, lot

Cash, cash, cash
I just took her home, I'm about to smash
Stash, stash, stash
Them hoes you be with are hella trash
Facts, facts, facts
I'm at barney's fucking up these stacks
She got ass, ass, ass
When I hit it, she gon' throw it back like
Ooh, she a thot, thot
She just wanna have my baby, it's not a plug
Ooh, just took a shot
Take another one, another one
That's a lot

Said ooh, that's a lot, lot
Look at them bands, that's a lot, lot
Like, ooh, we don't stop, stop
Count it up, that's a lot, lot
Like, hey, that's a lot!
Cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that's a lot, lot
Count it up, that's a lot, lot

Cashing checks, gotta flex
Tryna fuck, shoot a text
She said: now? I said: yes
Pulled up, put that pussy right to rest
I am nothing like the rest
I said: baby, I'm the best
Always pass the test
What can I say? I am grateful I am blessed

Said ooh, that's a lot, lot
Look at them bands, that's a lot, lot
Like, ooh, we don't stop, stop
Count it up, that's a lot, lot
Like, hey, that's a lot!
Cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that's a lot, lot
Count it up, that's a lot, lot
