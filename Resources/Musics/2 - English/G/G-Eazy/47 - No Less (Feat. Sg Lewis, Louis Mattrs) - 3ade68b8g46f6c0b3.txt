NO LESS (FEAT. SG LEWIS, LOUIS MATTRS)

I just wanna do you right, right (yeah)
I just wanna do you right (yeah, uh)

'cause you deserve everything and more
You're royalty, a true queen that a king adore
I need you by my side
You the type I bring on tour
Let's fall asleep in l. a
Wake up out in singapore
Doing things I never did before
Fuck being selfish, I just wanna give you more
I'm going out my way so you know
What I'm in it for
I pay attention
All the little things to listen for
True love's true comprimise
Ride or die by my side as I'm on the rise
But if I fell off tomorrow
Would you disappear?
Sorry, sounds like I don't trust you
I apologize
But I'mma love her
I'm trying to give you all of me
So if you're down to follow me
Gotta do it honestly
You heard 'bout them hoes
My reputation follows me
But I just cut 'em off
Trading quantity for quality, you know?
Make it easy

I believe, I believe, I beli-ee-eve
(I believe)
Imma be, Imma be, Imma be the one you need
(the one you need)
I believe, I believe, I beli-ee-eve
(I believe in us, I believe in trust)
And I will show you that

I won't settle for no less (no less)
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest (you know)
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

Given you my all, nothing less than
More than a wifey, than my best friend
Do it all for my baby, not a question
Your hatin' friends keep hatin', bless them
I wanna be in your room, we could sleep all day
I wanna be somewhere the bullshit can stay away
I wanna get to the point
Where I don't have to lie
When you ask me
"is everything going to be okay? "
It's easier to sell a dream than keep it real
It's easier to numb the pain than really feel
Make it vanish in a moment with a magic pill
It's easier to lay away than pay the bill
Uh, would you stay with me if I was broke?
When we look in these mirrors
Are we seein' smoke?
And this might be the realest shit I wrote
Love's a challenge
But this ain't gotta be difficult

I won't settle for no less
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

And I will bring you all my rights
I just wanna do you right, yeah
I won't leave you down and out behind me
I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
