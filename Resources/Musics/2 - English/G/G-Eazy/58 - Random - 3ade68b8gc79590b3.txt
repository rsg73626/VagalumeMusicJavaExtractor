RANDOM

[Intro]
Young Gerald, uh

[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do all it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I am young, rich, and handsome
Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son, yeah
This shit is not random
Woah okay

[Verse 1]
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you
Cause I got what you got, I'm talkin' times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seeing right through
You're hollow, you follow
Everybody's not the real Mccoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
California out to Georgia, Florida then up to Illinois
When I listen to your music I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand them
Bred Jordan 1s from 2001 (Og)
Today I think I want a Phantom
If I don't get it I'ma throw a fuckin' tantrum, woah

[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random (nope)
Everybody ain't got it, understand son (sorry)
This shit is not random

[Verse 2]
Imagine it, put the hours in and stayed passionate
Wasn't blowin' money, I was stacking it
Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now, nothing less is adequate
Grab a check, cashin' it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for, nothing?
You must be mistaking someone
I had to go make that fundding
I'm tryna be great at something
Spend, not saving nothin'
Flying from the Bay to London
They say money talks but you ain't saying nothin'
Shh
Now try and shade me, I'm like, "I guess"
Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
Sign Cds and I sign breasts
Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex
Listen

[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it for me when them bands come
I got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son
This shit is not random
