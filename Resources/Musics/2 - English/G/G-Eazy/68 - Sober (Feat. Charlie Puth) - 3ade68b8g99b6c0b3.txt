SOBER (FEAT. CHARLIE PUTH)

Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over
OO-oo oo oo (you know)
OO-oo oo (story of my whole life)
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

Eazy
Uh, yeah, I might regret this when tomorrow comes
But, the drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
With every shot, they're like: Ah, here Kobe comes!
But, I got this bad bitch trying to throw me buns
If I listed to my Uncs, all them older ones
They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes
But, life is short, enjoy it while you're young
Spend my bank account tonight
and have withdrawn funds
It all started with a light glass
Now I'm asking: How long could tonight last?
Man, she had an eeh face with a tight ass
If I had a shot less, then I might pass
But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated
I can't believe we made it, every night we celebrate it
I live like Jim Morrison, no telling where I'll take it
I take her to her room and I tell her get naked

Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over
OO-oo oo oo, oo-oo oo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
OO-oo oo oo, oo-oo oo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

I slipped up with my ex and I snatched again
Stayed over, now she's about to get attached again
Walls built up around, they come crashing in
Passed out at 6 A. M., but she's up at 10
Doing this was not in my plans
She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings, some just left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like: Alright then
On both sides, that was bad for 'em
Why do people do things that be bad for them?
Say we done with these things, then we ask for them
When the sun comes down, then we transform
Yeah, you can probably bet this
By this time tomorrow, I'll probably regret this
Try, but it all falls down like Tetris
No telling where an 80 proof gets us

Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over
OO-oo oo oo, oo-oo oo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
OO-oo oo oo, oo-oo oo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
