THINK ABOUT YOU (FEAT. QUIÑ)

[Intro: Quiñ]
Cause I do, cause I do, cause I do care
Keep writing you

[Verse 1: Quiñ]
Got this racing heart
Got you on my mind
Don't ever think I don't
I know what you like
And I'm the only one that ever should
Only one that cross your mind
Make me want to hit you right
Right now, and don't even think about it
I could get you right now
And I'm the only one that ever could
I do but you sure don't

[Hook: Quiñ]
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you oh oh
Cause I do boy
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Cause I do, cause I do, boy
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Cause I do, boy don't

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Last night I sent a message
Drunk when I sent it, pieces of a fragmented sentence
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And cross the line just saying if you're down
Let's chill and get a drink
I sip, hoping I would hear again
The text bubble popped up and dissapeared again
Like I don't want it getting weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
Sometimes I wonder if you share my sentiments maybe
Let me know

[Hook: Quiñ]
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you oh oh
Cause I do boy
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Cause I do, cause I do, boy
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Cause I do, boy
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you oh oh
