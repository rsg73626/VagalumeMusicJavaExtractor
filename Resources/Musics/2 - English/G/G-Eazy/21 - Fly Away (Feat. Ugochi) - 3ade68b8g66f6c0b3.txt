FLY AWAY (FEAT. UGOCHI)

Little bird
Little bird
Little bird
Little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away

I should have known
But this won't ever work here
Honestly realized it way
Back in our first year
I'm not even religious
But hope there's a church near
It's whiskey on my lips
And it's been too much thirst here
My lifestyle is gettin' outta hand
I come down and take a xan
Did too much blow tonight
I try to sleep, but I can't
Ignoring phone calls
When she hit me I don't answer
'cause I'm faded
I ain't tryna listen to another lecture
These drugs are the only way
I'm escapin' from the pressure
You don't know what it's like for me
You got no way to measure
She said "I know you well
Why you don't let me in to help you?
These groupies at these parties
They don't even know the real you
I'm worried about you
Hope you never do enough to kill you
Decide what you want
'cause I can only wait until you
Push me so far
Then I've got nothing else to tell you
If I don't make you happy
Hope success and all the wealth do

Little bird, little bird
Little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?

The toughest part is letting go
Million times you saw the cliff
But never jumped to end it though
Mistakes can always turn
Into another lesson though
Say I'm selfish
But you're telling me what I already know
If you were smart you would run away
And never let me know
Where you went, so I can't chase you there
Fly away and go
Don't ask about me
You'll be happier the less you know
Nothing'll change if we keep staying put
Like we're in control
But you just don't budge
You just like an old judge
Can't you see we got stains on this?
This is no smudge
If only we could live with no liquor, no drugs
You got every right to hate me
But you still hold no grudge
You gotta go, even though it hurts
Is this for certain?
Even though I'd hate to see you
With another person
And even though you'll always be there
In my heart just lurkin'
Haunting me, I gotta find myself
And now I'm searchin'

Little bird, little bird
Little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?

I wish you happiness
One day you'll find the right one
You're a queen
You deserve to be treated like one
Vacation for the mind every time
I go to light one
Karma is a bitch
I'm well aware one day it might come
Yeah, one day it might come

Little bird, little bird
Little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?
