BRING BACK BREAKFAST

Cereal,
Get me through the door.
Turn me on,
With your vitamins and minerals.

Oh! oh! oh! oh!

The afternoon has become the new morning,
And there’s no pattern to sleep.
The hours awake are spent as a zombie,
Except for the few hours after coffee.

Oh! oh! oh! oh!

I’m missing you so badly,
You’d brighten up every morning,
Cereal.

I missing you so badly,
I’d eat you for every meal,
Cereal.

Yeah!
