LEARN TO SHARE

Spider,
Why are you hanging around?
Spider,
Why are you hanging around?
Get out of our kitchen,
And go get a job.
It’s not fair,
For you to live here.

Hanging on by barely a thread at all...

Spider,
Why are you hanging around?
Spider,
Why are you hanging around?
Get your eyes off of my donuts,
I’m going to eat them all.
It’s not fair,
For you to live here.

Go to your home,
You don’t have a home?
It’s not fair,
I guess I can learn share.

Dangling on down from the ceiling,
Trying to land on something appealing.
Swiftly at first but not anticipating,
A sudden wind from the vent.

Hanging on by barely a thread at all...
