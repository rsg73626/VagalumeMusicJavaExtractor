WE DON’T NEED OUR HEADS

With wheels on the pavement,
We’re feeling so grand,
Lose a little skin, get up and do it again.

Head up in the clouds,
And our toes in the sand,
Lose a little skin, get up and do it again.

Hangin’ on the outside,
It’s so much more fun,
We don’t need our heads cuz our bodies are young.

Nights under moonlight,
And days in the sun,
We don’t need our heads cuz our bodies are young.

I used to hate sleep,
I’d think of all the things,
That I could be missing, let’s stay up until the morning.

We can go sledding if we want to,
We can do anything we want to,
We don’t want to miss a thing, let’s stay up until the morning.

We don’t need our heads,
When we’re jumping off buildings,
Lose a little skin, get up and do it again.
