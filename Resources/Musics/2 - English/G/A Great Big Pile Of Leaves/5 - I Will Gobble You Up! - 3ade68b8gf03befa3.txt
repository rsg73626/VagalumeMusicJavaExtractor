I WILL GOBBLE YOU UP!

Dearest,
Pumpkin,
Why did you have to leave?

Red velvet,
You looked so sweet,
I met some of your friends,
You I can’t wait to meet.

The taste of your favorite thing,
It will become a memory.
Hey tasty, come to me!
I can be your memory,
Come to me!

Stay a while,
Coffee break,
I’m not ready for you to go away.

Gingerbread,
Show your head!
I’m not ready for you to go away.

On a mission to find nutritious eats,
But tricked again by silly heuristics,
They get the best of me.

Oh, patient darling,
We can make out.
Hey tasty, come to me,
And we can make out.
