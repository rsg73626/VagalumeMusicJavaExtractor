GREAT FUN

Gonna have some great fun,
Gonna work some more hours,
Get a great insurance,
And a network of friends.
I can’t wait for full coverage at the dentist again.

Gonna get some new glasses, oh how far I will see!
I wonder what kind of details that I have been missing.

Gonna have some great fun while we can still be wild,
Gonna have some great fun while we can still be wild.

Gonna have some great fun,
Gonna save some money.
Gonna own everything,
Well on paper at least,
Until that page is thrown away, then everyone will forget me.

Gonna play the lottery until I can get away,
I’ll win just in time to retire and be too tired to do anything.

Gonna have some great fun while we can still be wild,
Gonna have some great fun while we can still be wild.

You better enjoy your newspaper reading,
That feeling on your fingers will become obsolete.
