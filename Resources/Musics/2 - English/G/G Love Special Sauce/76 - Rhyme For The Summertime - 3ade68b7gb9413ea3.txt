RHYME FOR THE SUMMERTIME

August The Third Month
Summer With Sunrays
While Sunshine Blazed
My Eyes Were Kind Of Glazed
To Put Some Cream In My Coffee
I'm Making A Call
Cooling By The Fence Of The Street
With The Sex Stalls
So Many Freaks Geeks Rats
Cool Cars And Fat Girls
I'm That Kid Lounging In My Own World
Dig Daydreaming Girl
I Think She's A Dancer
I'd Like To Catch The Ho-show
But My Visit Was Cancelled
I Was Hungry My Takeout Had Been Fixing
Ordered Fried Rice Eggroll Wonton And Big Chicken
Then I Went To Meet The Mac Lil'
Cool Elixing Drinking Tipping Wine From The Bottle
Models Fly Girls With Sauce
Bums Who Are Lost
More Garbage That's Tossed
From The Doors And Windows
Roof Tops And Building
25 Cents A Show
All The Freaks Know
A Rhyme For The Summertime
Straight Up
Rapmop Blue
Digging The Scene From
The Streetside View
So When I'm Cooling On The Block
Look For Some Action I Can't Rest
Till I Find Satisfaction
