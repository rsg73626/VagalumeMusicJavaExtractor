Thats some funky lemonade you got going there babe
Is it special for me
Did you make it today
Ill always stop by if you like me to
Ill do anything that you could ever want for me to do
A kis for some of this
A smile and its done
Miss Im your mister
My sisters your sister
My mothers your mother fathers your father
It all started when I kissed her it was love at first
sight
Better when it started
I aint broken hearted but baby
I need some time alone with the crew to do the stupid
things that we used to do
Upon this she dropped me
With a frying pan
This is love Im not gonna leave it

My babys got sauce
Your baby aint sweet like mine

My babys got sauc eand of course as a matter of course
she does what she
Wants to cause shes the boss
Please dont tell my friends about the situation
They think Im on some extended vacation
I dont get out to see my boys anymore
Only time I leave the house is to go to the store for
what she wants what she
Wants what she wants me for
What could she want this time
Im all hers
She aint even hardly mine
Believe me what she do at night I dont know
I could guess it aint right
She got me waiting comes in late and Im trying not to
raise my voice
Negotiating it
Shell win the argument
Shouldnt even started it Im broken hearted I cant be
parted
I need a taste
So I count my loss mmmmm

My baby got sauce
