I dont want my Wheaties
Give 'em to the needy
Feelin kinda greedy
I keep em for myself (X9)

No Grapenuts for grandma
Mom likes Special K
You cant pinch an inch (X7)
They're magically delicious
Ya can't catch my Lucky Charms*
(pink hearts, yellow moons,blue diamonds, green clovers)
A is for Apple J is for Jack
You step on a crack
Youll break your mother's back
Rice Krispies
??
Ooh Boo Berry

In the morning
At your table

Snap Crackle Pop (X7)

Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs (X8)
Trix are for kids! (X10)

No Grapenuts for Grandma
Grandma gets a Bran Muffin
