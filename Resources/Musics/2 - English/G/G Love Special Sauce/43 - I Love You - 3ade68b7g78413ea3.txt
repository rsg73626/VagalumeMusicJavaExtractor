I LOVE YOU

I Guess I'm Lucky
It's In My Blood I've Got You And Us Two
That's What I'm Thinking Of
So You're Moving Into My Place
That's A 24 Hour Taste
That's No Can That's A Case
This Feeling I Sure Can't Sense
I Know It Sounds Old
But I Love You I Love You
I Love You
So We Seem A Little Young We Have Fun
We're Friends We've Lovers
Who Cares About Those Others
Already Got Fathers And Mothers
Two Can Be A Crew Got Plenty To Do Something To See
Look In My Eyes Baby
Believe Me
I Know It Sounds Old
But I Love You I Love You
I Love You
Your Pops Don't Like Me
Your Moms Sure Does
She's Seen The Looks I Give You
Seen Them Enough
To Know This Ain't No Phase
Or Some Part Time Craze
It's A Love Affair That Lasts During The Week Days
I Believe In Lucky And Money
I've Got Ten Bucks And A Honey
I Know I'm Lucky
Just Look At You And Me
Move On In Move On In
That Ain't No Sin
It Ain't Gonna Be A Sin
When We Turn The Lights To Dim
I Know It Sounds Old
But I Love You I Love You
I Love You
