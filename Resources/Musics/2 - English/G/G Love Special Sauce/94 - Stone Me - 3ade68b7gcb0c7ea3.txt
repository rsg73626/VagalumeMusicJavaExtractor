STONE ME

Well now okay, you want to run me out, run me down
But i heard, you're concerned
Baby that you going down
Gettin' down while i'm gonna roll out of town
Rumors flyin', people lyin'
I'm just tryin', tryin' to keep my head up off the ground
Oh yeah

It's getting harder and harder
I check my pride but you runnin' high
With some other guy and i'm about to die
Tellin' lies, runnin' and cheatin'
And doin' what you please
And no one was surprised
The only thing you need me for is the money

And now i'm so damn confused
Cause even though i paid my dues
Ain't no matter what i do i'm gonna lose
Cause you stone me, stone me, stone me

And now we known each other so long
How we're goin' on and on
I wish i was never gonna be alone
So long, i was dead wrong
Cause you're moving on with your life
Left me in your past, you're past
You're with some other guy
You used to make me high
But now you just stone me
I thought we was in love and now you say
You rollin' holy, left me living lonely
Mmm, what about our son

You have your own child
What you wanna run around
Baby you a wild child
Play on, play on
She get to play on, play on

Then you come a runnin' back
Workin' hard, all alone, too late
Baby i am solo
You hurt me so bad, it took me so long to rise
But baby i survived
Now i don't even wanna see your eyes
You stone me
You hurt me so bad, it took me so long to rise
But baby i survived
Now i don't even wanna see your eyes
You stone me, stone me...
