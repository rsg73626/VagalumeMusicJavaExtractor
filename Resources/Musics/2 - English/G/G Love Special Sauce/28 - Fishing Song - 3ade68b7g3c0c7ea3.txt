FISHING SONG

I'm going fishing 'bout a quarter to nine
I see my lil lady and she looks so fine
Aw my lines so tight
I figure tonight i'm gonna get a lucky bite singing

*all the fishes love me
They all wanna jump on the end of my line
I love all the fishes
But i can't get you off my mind
Singing hey....

I'm going fishin about a quarter of eight
Now come on pretty momma don't you make me wait
Something's tugging on the end of my worm.
I been fried and i've been burned singin

*repeat

I'm going fishing 'bout a quarter to six
I'm a find a lil lady put her up in the mix.
The finest fish that i ever seen
Is the fish in the back of my limousine.
She looks so fine all the time
The kind of fish i'm gonna keep on the line singin

*repeat...
