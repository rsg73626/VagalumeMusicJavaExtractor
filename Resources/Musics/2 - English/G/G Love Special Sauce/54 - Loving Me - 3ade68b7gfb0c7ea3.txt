LOVING ME

Will you let me know
If I have done you wrong today?
Cause you won't say nothing to me
And I can't help feeling that you're mad

I can't fight you anymore
I forgot what I'm fighting for
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

Shall this moment of unsurity pass
Would you speak kind words to me
All that I'm saying is, "Please treat me nice"
And I promise I won't do no wrong

Ohhh won't you let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

If you have plans to leave me girl
Won't you just let me know?
Cause you finally got me loving you
And now you wanna let me go

I feel like I could explode
Won't you help to ease the load?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad...
