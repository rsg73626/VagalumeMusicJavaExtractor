GIVE IT TO YOU

I don't care what you do
I only care about you
And i don't care what you say
Are you coming my way
And i don't care what your mama say
And i don't care what your papa say
And i don't care what your friends say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Come on and take a ride
Come on and take a ride

I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you

And i was all out of luck
You brought me the jackpot
All out of luck
The kissing and the hugging
On a nervous breakdown
I tell you a little something
I want to thank you babe
You kept me from buggin
Na na na na... (x4)

Well let me tell you about a girl i met one time
She got the looks and the books gotta make her mine
She told me things that nobody ever told me
And if she taught me well i learned that i loved
All the time we would spend in the night just talking
The morning i would leave her, then i'd come back knocking
For you girl
Always looking for you girl
Always looking for you girl

I got to give it to you
All of my loving
I got to give it to you
All my kissing and hugging
I got to give it to you
Don't you know i got to give it
I got to give it to you
So pretty mema come on with it

And i was all out of luck
You brought me the jackpot
All out of luck
The kissing and the hugging
On a nervous breakdown
I tell you a little something
I want to thank you babe
You kept me from buggin
Na na na na...
