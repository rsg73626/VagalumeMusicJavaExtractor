NO TURNING BACK

She was just 19 years old
When she left her home
The morning dessert sun was at her back
She knew right them
There would be no turning back
Leaving home was the best thought that she had
But know in a parking lot in Washington
She asked to herself what have I done
Earth mother bear and eagles was on the run
Two more nights till Colorado
Till the deal was done
And if flying back home
Was as easy as the run
She realized then there would be no turning back
Were will you take me?
What will we do?
Were will you take me?
What will we do?
The man drove by in a bright white Cadillac
She got in that ride and she never came back
She knows what she needs
She said it feels good to me
She knows what she needs
She said it feels good to me
Ainâ€™t no turning back
