STILL HANGIN' AROUND

You might be crazy
But then again, so am I
They ought to stick me in an institution
Just so I can be by your side

Look at me, I'm still hanging around
Still hangin around, oh baby I'm still around

You might break up
In a million pieces
Crying in the middle of the street
Blame it all on me

Look at me, still hanging around
Still hangin around, oh baby I'm still around

People say you don't fall in and out of love all the time
People say that it don't come easy
But you sure came easy for me oh my

Now, I won't tell no one our business
About the night we met
But if you're lookin for trouble
Trouble is what you get

Look at me, still hanging around
Still hangin around, oh baby I'm still around

Now there's a lot of things that I'd like to change 'bout myself
There ain't a thing I'd change about you baby
Except maybe... well...
Oh I'm just kidding can't you tell
You're like water from the well

My buckets filled
And its got no leaks
The means every drop I got of you girl
I'm gonna keep

Look at me, still hanging around
Still hangin around, Oh baby I'm still around
I'm still around...
