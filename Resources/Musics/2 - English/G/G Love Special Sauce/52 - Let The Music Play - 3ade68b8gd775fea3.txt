LET THE MUSIC PLAY

Let the music play (play) ...
The sun is up you know its hot
No sense in worrying about what you aint got
Talk is talk action is action
just trying to find my soul some satisfaction
gotta take it easy so easy

tired of all this runnin and bringin runnin round
time to jump on thee outside ill hit the under ground
better take a little second and check on that
cause if not then youll be burnin out

we oughta take it easy...

somethings gotta give...

let the music play (play)

bring on your music 
bring on your song
let the music play all night

turn on your music 
turn down the lights
let the music jam all night
let it treat you right rock you right do you right
get it right now
on and on...
