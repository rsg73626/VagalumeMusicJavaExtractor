RAINBOW

Rainbow (Feat Jack Johnson)

Well I woke up this mornin',
Rainbows filled the sky,
Yes I woke up this mornin',
Rainbows filled the sky,

And there was God,
Tellin' me,
"Everythings gonna be alright"

Well so long good friends,
When will we meet again?
I said so long good friends,
When will we meet again?

Well I dont know,
I dont know,
But I guess I'll see you through
[G Love] "I'll see you man"

Well I'm gonna pack my own guitar,
Move on down the road,
(keep on movin)
I'm gonna pack my own guitar,
Move on down the road

(Where ya gonna go?)
Oh, where I go,
I dont know,
But I guess I just gots' to go

Well I woke up this mornin',
Rainbows filled the sky,
Well I woke up this mornin'
Rainbows filled the sky,

And there was god,
Tellin' me,
"Everything.. Everythings gonna be alright!"
