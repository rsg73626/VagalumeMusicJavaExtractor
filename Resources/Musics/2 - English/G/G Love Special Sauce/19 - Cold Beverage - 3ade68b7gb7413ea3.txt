COLD BEVERAGE

Yo- Could I Get A Cold Beverage
I Need Some Leverage
It's Sunny Outside
Some Lemonade Would Be Nice
Or A Sprite Through The Drive Through
At B.k. Yo I'll Buy Girl A Drink
But Girls Got To Pay
On The Front Porch I Got
Some Iced Tea
If You Like A Taste Of Tea
Then Come Along With Me
It's Martini Time
Yeah Yeah Feeling Golden
Bring Your Own Beverage
Just Make Sure It's Cold
I Like Cold Beverage
Give Me A Frosty Mug
Filled With A&w
If You Got Ice Cream
Make It A Double Scoop
Milkshade At The Fountain
Really Good Sounding
Chocolate Egg Cream
Yo, I'm Champ Cherry Pounding
Caught A Chill Vibe
Orange Juice In My Ride
Wawa's To The Right
They Got A Beverage Inside
Dig Me A Hot Coffee
Fill It Up With Ice
Watermelons Like Drink
Please Fix Me A Large Slice
Summertime Is Cool The Heat Is Getting Old
Yeah I'll Get A Beverage
Just Make Sure It's Cold Cold
I Like Cold Beverage
When I'm Fishing
Let's Keep One Thing Clear
The Baits Over There
The Brews Right Here
Two Six Packs And A Big Bag Of Ice
Didn't Even Catch A Bit
But The Brew Tasted Nice
Back To The Bar
Strawberry Daiquiris And A Colada
I Need A Whole Lotta Them
Fruit Drinks To Catch Me A Buz
I Must Tell You I'm The
Cool Aid Kid
Before You Serve My Drink
Please Stick It In The Fridge
I Like Cold Beverage
