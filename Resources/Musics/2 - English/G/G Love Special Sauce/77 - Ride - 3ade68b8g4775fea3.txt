RIDE

???
By the side of the road
I got a pocket full of nothing
And I know what I know
I know what I know
I don’t know nothing else
If you could teach me something
I’d sure appreciate the help
And its Back and forth 
Forth and back
Around in a circle
Now how do ya like that?
How does it feel when you’re going nowhere
Won't you start sometime
Let me know
Won't you start sometime
Let me know
Some time ago
Somebody told me something
I can’t remember what they said
I can’t remember nopthing
They say you only hear what you wanna hear
But I can only hear this guitar
Ringing in my ears
Back and forth 
Forth and back
Around in a circle
Now how do ya like that?
How does it feel when you’re going nowhere
Won't you start sometime
Let me ride
Won't you start sometime
Let me ride
I wanna ride-a high
Are you ready to ride?
Close my eyes
So I can see in the dark
Sometimes I only wanna hear
The sounds of stars
A weeping
A weepin
The where and the was-ins
Just the sound of sleepin
And I aint saying nothing
The sound of him sleepin
Don’t it sound nice?
I think I gotta go get some advice
And its Back and forth 
Forth and back
Around in a circle
Now how do ya like that?
How does it feel when you’re going nowhere
Wont you start sometime
Let me ride
Wont you start sometime
Let me ride
I wanna ride-a high
Won’t you let me know
Cus I wanna know…..
Whats inside…..
