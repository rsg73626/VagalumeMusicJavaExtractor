TAKE YOU THERE

There's a place that I know
Where people wanna go when they want to get out of the city
And if you wanna go... we can get you there in a hurry

people walkin' round, enjoing a summer day
No working now, through the walk of the sunshine's ray
There's a ginger playing down by the riverside
And beneath the bridge of a girl to like

hey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, yeah... (2x)

we can take you there... we can take you there... (7x)
hey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, yeah...
we can take you there... we can take you there...

There's a place that I know
Where people wanna go when they want to get out of the city
And if you wanna go... we can get to there in a hurry
people walkin' round, round, round, round
