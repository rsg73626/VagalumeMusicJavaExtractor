OF HONOR AND HARMONY

No need to pull some weight around
But then I ain`t gonna just sit here
Like a clown and just wait around
I`m taking what I`ve earned to be taking
And you know you only get stronger
When your heart is asking
But me I`ve had enough of walking around for some red tape
You know it`s just a fake
I say it`s a big mistake

And we`re all human
So there`s no need to be taking it
With some honor and harmony
We`ll surely be making it
With a little bit of honor and harmony...
Come on!

What shall we choose to be our tactics
In this age of computer taxes oh no
When in this new era to come
We shall be organized and not supervised
From the physical to the spiritual
All our works will be so critical
Our offense and mental will soar
Our ornamental will be so pure
And we won`t sweat the expense
In the new millenium
We are raising through the fog
Helping the healing God
The next awakening is you

And we`re all human
So there`s no need to be taking it
With some honor and harmony
We`ll surely be making it
With a little bit of honor and harmony...
Come on!
