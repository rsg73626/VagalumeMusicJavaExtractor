CHAINS #3

Ain't no chains going to hold my body down
Ain't no chains gonna hold my body down
Ain't no chains gonna hold my body down
Cuz I'll swim with you from the sea to the sea

Ain't no waves gonna pull my body down
Ain't no waves gonna pull my body down
There, ain't no waves gonna pull my body down
Cuz I'll swim with you from the sea to the sea

Ain't no time gonna drown me from my cold
Ain't no time gonna drown me from my cold
Ain't no time gonna drown me from my cold
And I'll swim with you from the sea to the sea

There ain't chains gonna hold my body down
Ain't no chains gonna hold me down
Ain't no chains gonna hold my body down
Cuz I'll swim with you from the sea to the sea

I'll swim with you
You'll swim with me
You're so sweet
Ain't no shame in my game no no
There ain't no shame in my game
There ain't no shame thats included in my game
Cuz I'll swim with you from the sea to the sea...
