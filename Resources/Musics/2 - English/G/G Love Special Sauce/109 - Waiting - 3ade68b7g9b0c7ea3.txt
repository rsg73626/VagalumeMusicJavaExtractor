WAITING

Oh its been so crazy… to be carryin’ on this way
I mean to say I never love someone like you
Im tryin’ hard to make you stay
Even if you think im bustin’
Mama wont you hang around?
Eventhough I know you’ve gone insane
I don’t want to live without you babe.

Just waiting…for you to come around
Just waiting… for you to come around
Just waiting… for you to come around
Just waiting… for you to come around

But you just keep on tellin’ me
That im not your kind of man
I hope you find what your lookin’ for
But what could I?
Getting’ tired of hangin out
Standin’ on the corner for the end of time
Hangin for some seconds in the soup kitchen line
Im too tired.

Waiting… for you to come around
Just waiting… for you to come around
-You aint showin’ me no love-
Waiting… for you to come around
-No… you aint comin’ down-
Waiting… for you to come around
-Lord… Lord… Lord…-

(Instrumental)

Wont you put me out my misery baby
I wont tell you… never been too good at talkin’ any how
But im not so good… supposed to wait for a girl
To become the woman that she want to be
I waited five long years, pretty mama
Tell me when you gonna wait for me?
No…no…no…no…no…
No…no…no…no…no…
Too tired.

Waiting… for you to come around
Just waiting… for you to come around
Just waiting… for you to come around
-All my friends sayin’ you aint comin down-
-Baby I feel its time that maybe I put you down-
I put you down… I put you down… I put you down…
Im gonna put you down… put you down… put you down…
Im… gonna put you down..
Im gonna put you down…
Lord knows, I put you down
Put you down… put you down...
