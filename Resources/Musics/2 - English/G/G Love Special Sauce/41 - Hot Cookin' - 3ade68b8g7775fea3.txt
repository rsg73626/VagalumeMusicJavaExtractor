HOT COOKIN'

Don’t you let the heat out of the oven lord
It takes awhile to build a fire
Don’t let ‘em cool you down
Don’t let ‘em cool you down
Cause it’s some hot cookin’ that’s goin’ on tonight
And the temperature is risin’ just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burnin’ bright 
And I think I might
Cause if you put the fuel into the fire 
And you start a chain reaction
Which is burning me
Tossin’ turning me through the night
The temperature is risin’ fine
It’s this feeling strong I cant mask 
Its time for you to melt into desire

Cause it’s some hot cookin’ that’s goin’ on tonight
And the temperature is risin’ just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burnin’ bright 
And I think I might
My momma always said don’t play with fire
Don’t you go and burn this whole house down 
But I’m about to strike this match 
And put paper on the fire 
So you better run and call someone to come
My fever’s pitchin’ and I’m not so sure
Just what I’m talkin’ bout
I put my foot into my mouth 
I don’t know what I’m sayin’
But now is not the time for words
Forget all those things you heard
Its time for you to melt into the fire
Cause it’s some hot cookin’ that’s goin’ on tonight
And the temperature is risin’ just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burnin’ bright 
And I think I might
Yes I think I might 
Yes I think I might
Oooooooooh - I think I might
