ON 9-11-01

Flags flown at half mast
To remember all the lives past and gone
Before their time had come
From a hijacker's crash
A terrible blast
A building collapses
And falls to the ground

Who would have known?

So long and hard to make
So easy to break
Foundations quake
To rock your world

Planes exploding in the sky
No one knows the reasons why
Make me wanna cry

How hard it is
To protect yourself
From hatred
You cant understand
Dedication to destruction
Is their unholy plan
No corprate scenes
They move in a mist
Try to shake thier hands
While their slicing your wrists
Killers beyond comprehentions of our minds
How cowards could burn up blood in the skies
Blood in our eyes
On 9-11-01

Planes exploding in the sky
No one knows the reasons why
Hold my little baby tight
Make me wanna cry
And find a way
To carry on

New york city on lock down
The whole east coast on lock down
Hold your family close on lock down

Our country mourns the day
So many bright lights
Young live were
Taken away
Forever and ever
And no one can replace
And how can i forget this day

Planes exploding in the sky
No one knows the reasons why
Hold my little baby tight
Make me wanna cry

Planes exploding in the sky
On 9-11-01
The day the devils died
To kill our loved ones
Hold my little baby tight
On 9-11-01
Make me wanna cry
And find a way
To carry on...
