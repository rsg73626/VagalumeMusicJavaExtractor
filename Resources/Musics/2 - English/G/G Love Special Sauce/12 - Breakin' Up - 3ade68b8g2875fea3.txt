BREAKIN' UP

your words don't come easily no more
i wonder what your doing every second that i'm not with you and now i see what i put you through i should be gone something keep me hanging on
it's instinct
but all this pain i feel doesn't phase you
it's funny what the drugs will do
and now i'm crying
now how could someone spend so much time so close and almost so far away
how could two people stay together so long just because they're afraid to walk away

i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
the time is so wrong but the feelings so right
won't you let me kick it just one more time
won't you let me love you and hug you and squeeze you tight
won't you be my darlin tonight
kiss me one more time before you turn your back forever
now you walking away
look me in the eye and smile like you did the very first time i called your name
tell me everything's gunna be alright
even though i can't hold back these tears
for five long years i was afraid to give it up now you're gunna leave me and my best friend is gone
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
why won't you let me love you baby baby
startin from scratch
startin from scratch
why won't you let me love you bay baby
startin from scratch
startin from scratch
you my friend and my sister my lover i don't wanna find another to replace you
start all over again, start all over again
you my friend and my sister my lover i don't wanna find another to replace you
start all over again, start all over again
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
i swear to god we're breaking up this time
