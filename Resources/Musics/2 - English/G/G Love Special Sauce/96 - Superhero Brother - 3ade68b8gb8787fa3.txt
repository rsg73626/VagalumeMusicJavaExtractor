SUPERHERO BROTHER

Every once in a while, 
gotta use my superpowers, 
Even though saving the world 
outta style, 
It ain't my fault all 
this bad stuff is happening 
but now its time 
I put my foot on down 

aaaawwww baby, 
my love don't seem the same 

no no 

They save love's all you need 
To heal the world, 
plus a trillion billion dollars 
have you heard 
There's president bush, 
Santa Claus and Green Goblin 
Saddam Hussein, 
Spiderman, 
And Bin lLden 
Britney Spears, 
Jesus, 
and the whole cast of friends 
met for brunch last week 
to solve the world's problems 
well they called on me 

aaaaww baby 
my love don't seem the same 

Well if they called on my name 
don't you know i'd do it 
shine my signal over Gotham, 
I'll be true 
It is my distinct pleasure 
to come down from my grass 
get off of my front porch 
and save all your asses 

and in the nick of time too 

awww baby 
my love don't seem the same 

Well change 
has come over me, 
my muscle's growin 
so i freestyle 
my ass 'cross the USA 
Solve the economy 
the homeless problems, 
save what's left 
of the environment 
create jobs 
for everybody doin somethin 
that they wanna be doin 
Yeah, 
well if you can't do smack 
then you better do something 
cause this is the time 
when you so can't do nothin 
well that mean's you, 
and you and you 
and you and me too 

aaaaww baby 

Then I'd fly overseas 
and set all the slaves free, 
from prostitution, 
sweat shops, child labor, 
solve the myriad of problems 
in the middle east 
make a sun powered car, 
we won't have to fight 
for oil fees 
And i'll take all 
the troops back, 
from where ever they roam, 
and where ever they fightin, 
and whatever side they're on 
and i'll send them 
on the first flight 
home to their mom's 
we could make coffee tables 
out of all these bombs 
and save the whales, 
and the pigmee 
marmasetts too. 

aaawww baby 

well it seems kinda hard 
but it really ain't nothin, 
all you gotta do is get bit 
by a spider or somethin, 
we could change the world 
in a week or a day 
and if you got problems 
man i'll sweep them away, 
if you find yourself 
in a world full of trouble, 
just call on G. Love, 
the superhero brother 

and, i'll be there 
yeah 
i'll be there 
huh 
i'll be there 
mmhhmm 
i'll be there 

aaaawww baby 
my love 
don't seem the same 
no no no
