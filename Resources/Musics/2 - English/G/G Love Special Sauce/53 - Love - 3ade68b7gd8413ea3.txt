LOVE

Baby we’ve been through a lot
And times sure have changed
Everybody’s leaving town
Looking for better things
But I found what I want
And I got no problem working
I wish to god
That my heart would stop hurting
Shops closing down
Factories outdated
People so frustrated
My whole life is changing
Just trying to find some solid ground
A little house with a picket fence
How’s that sound

Love is all I need
Love is all I need

I’ve seen tears that are
Falling like leaves from the trees
Houses boarded up and they
Threw away the keys
But this town is where we’re born
And this town is where we’re staying
I’ll never ever turn my back
On you ever again
Come on let’s be together
I got some money put aside
And if I make it big
Would you take a little ride
Would you promise to always
Stay by my side
Woudl you give me true love
And have nothing to hide
Would you give my your love
Would you give me your love
Would you give me your love
If you want to give me your love babe
It’s alright
It’s alright
It’s alright
We can make a change in our life babe
Tonight
It’s alright
It’s alright
