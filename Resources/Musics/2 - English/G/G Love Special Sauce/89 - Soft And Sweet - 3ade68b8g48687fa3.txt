SOFT AND SWEET

Chilling out on a ridge, 
by the sea, in a ranchido. 
Cool breeze through the trees 
sings a song so sweet. 
For my baby and my boo boo, 
asleep they lay, 
so I picked up my guitar 
and I started to play. 
The music was pulsing 
blood up to my eyes 
I surmised the horizon, 
sun rising, 
surprising the hell out 
of the clouds 
like they were kissed 
for the first time. 
The sun was steady rising 
and I'm sitting in the sunshine 

I hear my baby crying 
and he's just waking up 
so I walk through the screen door 
and I go pick him up. 
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, 
rocka back and forth. 
Baby quit crying then I'll go 
and play some more. 

Soft and sweet melodies 
while your momma's sleeping 
let her sleep in late this morning 
let her sleep 'til 
the sun is burning down 
burning down down down 

Baby baby hold my fingers 
with your little tiny hands. 
While we lounge in a hammock 
checking out all the land. 
I smell the sweet scents 
of papaya and lime. 
I smell the ocean breezes, the salt, 
and my mind is captivated 
by your big brown eyes, 
which remind me of mine. 
Now I know we're two of a kind. 
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, 
rocka back and forth. 
Baby quit crying 
then I'll go and play some more. 

Soft and sweet melodies 
while your momma's sleeping 
let her sleep in late this morning 
let her sleep 
'til the sun is burning down 
burning down down down 
burning down, burning down, burning down 

The day is getting brighter 
and the wind is breezing down. 
The whole tree is shaking, 
fallen fruit is on the ground. 
I smile when I'm thinking about 
the love I've found. 
Momma's still sleeping 
so we play these mellow sounds 

Soft and sweet melodies 
while your momma's sleeping 
let her sleep in late this morning 
let her sleep 
'til the sun is burning down 
burning down down down 

burning down, burning down, burning down
