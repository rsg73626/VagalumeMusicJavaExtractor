BACK OF THE BUS

Swing like a pendulum
Rules you know i'm bending 'em
All the cool kids on the back of the bus
High like mt. everest looking for some leverage
Floating like some vapors coolin like a beverage
I cherish the moment when i get the lucky chance
To sing my song and let the funky people dance

Make it last. sonic blasts move past fast fly
Outta speaker's sneakers stomp to the rhythm that will romp

Let the wild rumpus start cause it
Just can't stop
And all the cool kids in the back of the bus
Cop a feel
Steal a kiss miss
I hope ya won't regret it
And all of the kids in the back i hope you get it

All the cool kids in the back of the bus
Rubba dubba scrubba bubba
Whatchu talkin' bout gus breakin the rules
I hope we don't get caught sha la la la la la la la la

All of the kids in the back quit buggin
Get your hands in the vehicle before you lose something
Keep bouncin to the beat of wheels that are bumpin
Get your ass out of bed
Cause you know the bus is coming
If you miss the damn bus well you better start running
Brown bag full of grub
Yo you gotta eat something
Keep rockin to the rhythm of the windshield wipers
Staying up late night all nighters
Keepin busy too much work is making you dizzy
All the cool kids in the back are you with me?

*all the cool kids in the back of the bus
Rubba dubba scrubba bubba whatchu talkin' bout gus
Breakin the rules i hope we don't get caught sha la la la la la la la la

Road trip runnin with the music up loud
Take a trip from the north to the dirty south
Wherever it leads ya/ overheated on the side of the road
Sweating that ass 25 cent cologne
Sticking to the seats like a lil piece of gum
And all of the kids in the back want to come
In the back of the bus its a make out session
She's got the salad an i've got the dressing

*repeat

Gotta get home and study for my final
Write your name on the back of the bus seat vinyl
Sitting on the stool by the principles office
Gettin chewed out cut down cut up cut out run out
Punished with demerits and detention
"oh its you again" please don't put me back in summer school
I'm just a kid
One of many
Trying to have a little fun bendin'
A couple of the rules on the back of the bus
The back of the bus
