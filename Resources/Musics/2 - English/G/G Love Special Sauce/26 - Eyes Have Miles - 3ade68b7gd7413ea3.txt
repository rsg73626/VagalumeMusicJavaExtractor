EYES HAVE MILES

Special Sauce With The Special Skills
The Special Find For The Special Fill
A Littel Bit On Top Of But Laid Back Cool
Wind The Thread From The Tale Spun
Back On The Spool
Not Too Blue But Azul
Stomping My Foot With My Sneak
Kicking It For The Back Beat
Fly Girl Undressed In The Backseat
I Might Look A Sneak
I Won't Steal A Peak
Caught A Glance From Some Good Sounds
Don't Eat From The Ground Round
Time To Get Up In A Get Up
Shake Your Butt Back Down
Got More Vapors In Action
Like Halls Mentholyptus
Misted As I Kiced This Hold On And I'll Twist It
Young Mother Young Mother
Should've Stayed Home
Poor Child Coming Gonna Be A Rolling Stone
Wild Wild The Obvious Child
Wild Tone Wild Eyes Have Miles
No Brown Bag Today See I'm Ice Dogging It
Catch The Cool-aid Kid I'm All Hogging It
Earl's Got The 64 Wet Cause He Sloshed It
Christmas Time Comes I'm Egg Nogging It
Look The Crook Snook A Hand In Your Pocket
Took Your Keys Then He Took Your Wallet
But You In Your Eyes Then Your Head He Clocked It
All You Could Say Was Stop It
Fuck You And Die
Get Away From My Piece Of The Pie
I'm Past All That
My Eyes Have Miles
Not Necessarily Clever
I Bring From The Soul Hold My Vocal
Handle For A Hold As I Walk Direct
I Roll For The Old
Never Be Sold Out
Cause The Sell Won't Gel
I Told You My Clams Inthe Shells
Already I Don't Sweating
Just Chill Cuddy
Celebrating
It's Those Doggone Kids Ever Since
They Was Born The Shining
No Musically Reweriting The Phrase
Relighting The Page As The Joker Pays
For The Dare On The Outside
Just Chops I Ain't Impressed
The Licks Are Removed I Just Can't Digest
It's Too Artificial Man
I Can't Dig It I Don't Want Affects
So I Say So On And Imma Go On
To The Real Next All Wood Tones
Earth Home Microphones I'm A Rolling Stone
I Tumble With Direction A Reflection
From The Street
My Drink Won't Dry Cause I'm I
Cool Like The Sky
My Eyes Have Miles
