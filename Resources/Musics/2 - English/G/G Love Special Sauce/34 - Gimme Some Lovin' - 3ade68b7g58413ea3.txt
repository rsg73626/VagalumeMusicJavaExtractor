GIMME SOME LOVIN'

Gimme some lovin' early in the morning
I've just woke up with this appetite
Come on, give me love in the morning light
(2x)

Some people like it in afternoon
I don't think that I can wait that soon
Come on, give me love in the morning light

Some people like it late at night
I could wait that long, but I don't think I might
Come on, give me love in the morning light

I'm gonna love the softely love, you sweet
I could feel your heart beat
Need your attention, to get in the story right

I'm gonna wake you up with a kiss on the cheek
Come a little closer, open up to me
Good morning baby, good morning baby

Open your eyes just a little bit
Good morning sunshine, I can't resist
Dreamed about you babe, all trough the night
