HOLLA

She’s so clean but I’m so dirty
I’m so ugly but she’s so purty
I thought that she would never let me get it
I can’t believe that she let me hit it
Once I laid it on ya you never would forget it bet
If I had some money yo id lay it on ya
You keep me lucky like the roulette wheel spinnin
You keep me guessing like it’s just the beginnin
Beginnin beginnin beginning beginnin yeah
And I know now girl that I love ya
And I’d tell ya babe if I could
But I’m leaving in the morning for a year long tour
And I won’t be back in your neighborhood
So - la la la la la la oh
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la wont you holla sometime, holla !
And if you find another boy when I’m gonna be broke
See at rehearsal there in the pass by her
And when I find myself getting to close in the situation
I don’t want no static aggravation
Want sweet loving, sweet salvation
Take me baby up to higher elevation
But I sure don’t want to get hurt
Living on alert, rubbed in the dirt
Treat it like a jerk
Jerk jerk jerk -treat it like a jerk

And I know now girl that I love ya
And I’d tell ya babe if I could
But I’m leaving in the morning for a year long tour
And I won’t be back in your neighborhood
So - la la la la la la oh
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la wont you holla sometime, holla !
Holla, holla, holla, life goes on
Long after the days of living are gone
Holla, holla, holla, life goes on
Long after the days of living are gone
Go go go go go go go

It’s been a long time coming
And the writings on the wall
Now its time for you to leave so baby please go
So I could beg you baby please don’t go
I could beg you baby please don’t go
I could beg you baby please don’t go
I could beg you baby please don’t go
And I’m saying
la la la la la la oh
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la wont you holla sometime, holla !
Holla, holla, holla, life goes on
Long after the days of living are gone
Holla, holla, holla, life goes on
Long after the days of living are gone
la la la la la la oh
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la wont you holla sometime, holla !
