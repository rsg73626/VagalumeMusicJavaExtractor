IN MY ARMS

Here i sit in my bed,
All alone-thoughts in my head,
Without you in my arms.

When i look at your face,
I know there's gonna be a race,
To get you in my arms.

And i can't live with you,
Can't live without you.
I can't live with you,
Can't live without you.

When i am in your prescence,
I feel as though i am in heaven,
With you in my arms.

Though i see you everyday,
Unfortunately i can't think of things to say,
Without you in my arms.

And i can't live with you,
Can't live without you.
Can't live with you,
Can't live without you.
