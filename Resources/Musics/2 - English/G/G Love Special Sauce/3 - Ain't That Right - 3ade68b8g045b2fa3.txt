AIN'T THAT RIGHT

Close my eyes
Evening dies
My friend rise up to the sunrise
Brand new day
New chance
Some say
If I can make a difference
In this world
Then I may
So I must
So I trust
All my lyrics just bust
Into this new day
Like I was busting a nut
Ohh feels so good
Rising up the "mornin-ornin" (morning)
I just got on the radio
It’s a positive moment
It’s something like
Just the perfect moon
Sonic the waves glaze
For days
In the sunlight haze
I feel good to be alive
All the shit that beat me down
Been doing this
I still survive
It ain’t at all complicated
I’m glad I found ya
It’s when you open your heart
That love surrounds you

Mmmmmm yeah baby 
Mmmmmm aint that right….

I wont live my life
By any rules or regulation
walk the road less traveled
Stay away from aggravation
As i assure
Like ???
A good time to ride the vibe
So we could all get nice

You want some advice
Stay on the hustle
Do it once
And get it right
I don’t just walk
I’ll take a hike 
Cause every day’s an expedition
I don’t just run 
I’ll take a bike
And put myself into position
Take the car, take a bus, take a train
rock it with precision
I’m decisive like decision
But yo
I’m only human
And I have my doubts
I wanna know where I fit it
And what this world is all about
It seems when I had my song
That learning was love
Love is what I'm teachin
So let me show you some

Mmmmmm yeah baby 
Mmmmmm aint that right….

Send me sweet kisses darling
I’m a catch them before they fall
Ain’t nobody’s business
What we do
Ain’t nobody’s business at all
Ooh not at all
They say that love is all you need to heal your wounds
And not be consumed by the everyday evils the man do
It’s just one of those moments that feels too good to be true
When I look in your eyes are you feeling love too?
No fear
No worry
No doubt
No concern
Just the brightest light
And let it burn
I said damn it feels good to hold your hand
Love’s the simplest thing
And now I start to understand
It aint at all complicated
I’m glad I found ya
It’s when you open your heart that love surrounds ya
Mmmmmm yeah baby 
Mmmmmm aint that right….
Send me sweet kisses darling
I’m a catch them before they fall
Ain’t nobody’s business
What we do
Ain’t nobody’s business at all
Ooh not at all
Not just a tiny bit
Mmmmm
Mmmmm….
