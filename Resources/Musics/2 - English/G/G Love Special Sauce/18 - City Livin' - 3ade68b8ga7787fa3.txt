CITY LIVIN'

City livin' lalalala 
City livin' lalalala 

City livin' is so tuff. 
Scrubbing floors on your hands and knees. 
City livin' can get so hot when 
It's a hundred and three degrees. 
City livin' can make you mean. 
Please don't stand so close to me. 
Franky's got a dream that's gonna get him paid. 
Jenny said, "Don't forget me babe"

Tony's making calls 
Swinging 50 bags and E's in the parking lot. 
Parking cars, working for tips 
He said, "These rich mothersuckers don't give me Shit"

Christina's in the back of the limousine, 
Working all day for the agency. 
About to go party 'til the sun comes up 
And that same old song is keeping her up. 

What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you? 
What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you? 
You just keep on shining through. 
Keep on shining through Keep on shining through. 

Now Ty is washing dishes at some fancy restaurant. 
And his check sure ain't stretching too far. 
'Cause he got too much month for the end of the money 
And not enough money for the end of the month. 
MJ and Red are running the clubs 
Making the scene every night. 
Bottles and tables for the fellas and the honey's 
And damn these girls are fine. 
But Luis don't know much about that delivering
groceries 
From the corner store. 
Sending some money back to Mexico so that his kids
ain't 
Sleeping on the floor. 

What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you? 
What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you? 
You just keep on shining through. 
Keep on shining through Keep on shining through.
