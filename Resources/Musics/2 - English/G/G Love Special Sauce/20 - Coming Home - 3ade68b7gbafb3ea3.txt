COMING HOME

in the fall leaves turn brown
nature songs it song takes it's course
now i know i'll be aveling on
winters comming the air is getting cold
birds are flying down the highway in the sky
this place is chaning so ami
i've got to leave it all behind
then someday i'll be back to claim what's mine
and not worry
someday i'll be comming home yes and din't worry now
someday i'll be comming home i don't know where i want to go but there is
one thing i know i've got to be on my own
so watch meas i go rambling down the road
singing songs of tales untold
mystery men and the day of old
im going where my dreams can be
where life is not reality where visons clad in colors true
can wake me where i'm going to and don't worry
someday i'll be coming home
yes and don't worry now
someday ill be comming home i don't, now what im looking for
im looking for an open door
to take me where i can live my life
the way want to
i'll do things my way
right or wrong
play and sing all day long
have my and tret it well
and be kind to my fellow man
you may say this ain't right
that's how i'll go about my life
i'll be light as a feather floating here and there
i don't know
someday i'll be comming home yes and don't worry now
someday i'll be comming home i'm comming home
i'm comming home
don't worry now
