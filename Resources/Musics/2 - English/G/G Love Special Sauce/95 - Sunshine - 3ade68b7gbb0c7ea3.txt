SUNSHINE

Sunshine, shining down
Gonna take a little walk around the woods
Don't care what we do, as long as I'm with you
Every lil' thing gonna be alright

Girl you look good, so good to me
I want you to stay
I don't want you to leave
Don't go, don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

I even love it when you're mad and so frustrated
Even though you made my simple life so complicated
Don't go, nah don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

Sunshine, shining down
Gonna take a little walk around the woods
Don't care what we do, as long as I'm with you
Every lil' thing gonna be alright

I can't get enough
I wanna eat ya up
I'm wanna have you for dinner
Leftover for lunch
Don't go, nah don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

Ohh, I done you wrong
But you done me back
Taught me a lesson
I can't forget that
Don't go, don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?

Ohhh, look whatcha did...
