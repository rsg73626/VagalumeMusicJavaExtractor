PEACE, LOVE, AND HAPPINESS

why let this world weigh 
on your shoulders 
pick it up push it off 
before you let yourself colder 
just look into the eyes 
the good eyes 
of a child and see 
that love rise like a river 
and flow for a thousand miles 
to give me some 
peace love happiness 
peace love happiness 
peace love happiness 
peace love happiness 

breathe in deep 
feel your heart beat 
just to know 
that life's worth living 
feel your feet on the earth 
you gotta (better) love it 
while it's still here spinning 
I got no time to worry 
about troubles or misgiving 
just let it go 
let yourself flow 
cause if you're hating 
then you sure ain't living 
gimme some 

peace love and happiness 

lotta people talking 
need somebody to listen 
lots of people struggling 
if you got 
then you better start 
giving a little more 

peace love and happiness 

how can we eat this daily bread 
when so many people starving? 
how come the president 
builds more bombs 
instead of just disarming? 
with all that money 
spends on guns instead of food 
and education 
we need to buy 
a little peace and love 
instead and start 
the healing of the nations 

gimme some 
peace love and happiness
