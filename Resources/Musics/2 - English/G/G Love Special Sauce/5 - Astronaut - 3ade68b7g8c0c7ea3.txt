ASTRONAUT

Hit it G

Some of these days
I just can’t seem to get out of bed
Waking up spider webs growing up in my hair
I’ve been last; tumbleweeds growin up in my face
It seems just like it’s a good time to blast off to space

Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Yeah

Some of these days despite all the things that in my head
Some of the days I love you despite all the shit you said
Tumbleweeds, rolling on rolling on around this town
I’m blasting off; I don’t even think I hang around

Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Yeah

Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago
Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago
Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago
Should I leave?
I should have left a long time ago

I just need a spaceship to get me right out of here
I wish I had never met you let you in my stratosphere
Spider webs getting in my brain
I’m the brother that you drove insane
I’m just a kid from the Milky Way
I’m blasting off momma I can’t stay

Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Right about now
Momma I’m an astronaut
Yeah

Beam me up, beam me up Scotty
Beam me up yeah
Beam me up, beam me up Scotty
Get me out of here
Beam me up, beam me up Scotty
Beam me up yeah
Beam me up, beam me up Scotty
Get me out of here
