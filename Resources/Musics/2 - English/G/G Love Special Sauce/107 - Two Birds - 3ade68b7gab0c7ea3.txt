TWO BIRDS

E'll be like two birds singing in the moonlight
Two fireflys lightin up the sky
Two stars shining through the clouds
Two clouds floating in the sky

We'll be like the moon when the sun is rising
Two bees buzzing round a flower
Two crickets singing back and forth all night
Two roses budding in the spring time

We'll be like the rain fallin in the desert
The milky way and the north star
We'll be like two peas in a pod
We'll be of the same mind and god

We'll be in love
We'll be in love
We'll be like two birds falling in love
We'll be like two birds falling in love
We'll be in love...
