CAN'T GO BACK TO JERSEY

You’re so fine
From your toes
to your hips
and your face
???
please don’t kick me out
on the streets
out the door
I don’t wanna stay on my cousin’s couch no more
I can’t do it
I can’t go back to living that way
Sweet sweet sugar momma
I know that i can change
I won’t do the shit
That piss you off
Or make you mad
Like come home late to dinner with your business friends
Or being out late night with the fellas at the club
Or the time I forgot your birthday at the studio
And I will try to be a little more sensitive
Cause I love you baby boo boo
And I need a place to live

I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
Ay yo why ya
Why ya
Why ya gotta do me like that

Yo I can’t go back to Jersey
Yo I ain’t going back
Ay yo I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
Yo why ya
Why ya
Why ya gotta do me like that
like that
And you don’t stop

Yo
I got a message from my girl
Who was furious and crying
She said who’s the chick you’re speaking with
Last night
And stop lying
Oh no
What could I do
I’m against the wall
Well I was fronting with this honey
I mean I pocket call
For fifteen minutes she had me leaning on tilt
Now she got the kitchen knife
And she’s staring at the diznick
Nothin happened
I didn’t touch her
didn’t make her smile
didn’t even fuck her
Didn’t grind for a little while
Didn’t even laugh
Buy a drink or hold her hand
She slapped me in the face and said
Pack your shit man

I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
Yo I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
Ay yo why ya
Why ya
Why ya gotta do me like that

Yo I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
I can’t go back to Jersey
I ain’t going back
yo why ya
Why ya
Why ya gotta do me like that
like that
And you don’t stop
Matt Bronsten

You know I’m storming
Trying to get back in good graces
I keep leaning on ????
Tripping on my shoelaces
I really love ya
I’ll rub a dub ya
I’ll fill the tub with bubbles
On the double
Oh shit
I’m in trouble
Buy you flowers
Cook you dinner
I hope my friends don’t see me running 'round like Bruce Jenner
That would not be cool it might
Ruin my rep
And my main objective is to
keep the bed we slept
Last night
And the night before last
???
I was driving fast
Take care of the situation
police shootout
From the lock
because she just threw all my shit out the window on the block
I can’t go back to jersey……….
