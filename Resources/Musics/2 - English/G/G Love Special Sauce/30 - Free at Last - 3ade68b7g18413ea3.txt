FREE AT LAST

Now I am trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give you insight might just change your life
I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,
I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,

I’m free from fooling 'round wasting time,
Floating in this abyss of your dreadful love
Free is a feeling so high in the sky
Higher higher higher

Free from the quarrels unsatisfaction
Free from the false dream that you planted
In me with your submissive love

I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,
I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,

Now I am open like the sky
For the sun to shine and colors true
To find me blue
Oh what a joy to be free

I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,
I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,

I’m free of cheating your poor heart at my own damn expense
The cost was heavy and it rent as a thunder cloud
A hurricane sure racked in my heart
Now the rain is gone and I am gone
Yes, I am moving on

I’m free at last, I’m free at last, I’m free at last,
