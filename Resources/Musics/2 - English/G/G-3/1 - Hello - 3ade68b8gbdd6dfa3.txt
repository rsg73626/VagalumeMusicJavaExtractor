HELLO

I'm in the fresh band new kicks
Your facebook is lookin old time for new flicks
Whats your status update? me
When you break up with him tell him don't hate me

It's not my fault cause the difference between he and I
Is my full time job is just bein fly
And my goal is cold play yellow
If he call cryin tell ryan say hitloff

-chorus-
I was runnin', runnin'
Lookin for somebody but i always end up with nothin', nothin'
Just a matter of time and i knew my prince was comin', comin'

And now i know i found you, cause you had me at hello, hello, hello
Tryna follow rules but i don't know the protocall
Should i make this move or, are you even interested at all?

Am i right? am i wrong?
If my instincts are honest, then welcome to my heart
I was tryna fill an empty space, lookin for someone who could take this pain away
And still somehow i'd end up feeling lonely
And then i met you, then i met you

-chorus-
I was runnin', runnin'
Lookin for somebody but i always end up with nothin', nothin'

Just a matter of time and i knew my prince was comin', comin'
And now i know i found you, cause you had me at hello, hello, hello
Standin on this wall i don't know how 
to catch my breath

Can you tell I'm watchin, can you feel this beating in my chest?
Its for you babe, don't know why it took so long to tell ya, welcome to my heart

I was tryna fill an empty space, lookin for someone who could take this pain away
And still somehow i'd end up feeling lonely
And then i met you, then i met you

-chorus-
I was runnin', runnin'
Lookin for somebody but i always end up with nothin', nothin'
Just a matter of time and i knew my prince was comin', comin'
And now i know i found you, cause you had me at hello, hello, hello

And the stars must come alive, for my lucky chance at love
Because i met you at this moment, this must be the right time now
Lookin in your eyes i say, welcome to my heart

-chorus-
I was runnin', runnin'
Lookin for somebody but i always end up with nothin', nothin'
Just a matter of time and i knew my prince was comin', comin'
And now i know i found you, cause you had me at hello, hello, hello

Hello my love, I'm so glad i met you
Hello my love, i won't forget you
Hello my love, my love, my love
Hello, hello, hello
