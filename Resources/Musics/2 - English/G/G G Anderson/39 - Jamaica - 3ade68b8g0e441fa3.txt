JAMAICA

A long long time ago there was a boy

He lived his life alone without any joy;
One day he found a bird with broken wings

Oh
he called him Andy and they shared everything.
Days becoming shorter at the end of the year

The long long winter came with sorrows and fears.
All the other guys were laughing 'bout him

But he had a dream that one day he'll win.
Jim and Andy - flying over the ocean to the land of emotion

Where all people live in harmony.
Jim and Andy - they are friends now forever

Livin' all time together
Jim and Andy.
Spring was coming near
the bird had grown up

And everyone was getting heatet and praying to God

When Jimmy took his place between the wings of the bird -
They flew away without a single word.
Jim and Andy - flying over the ocean to the land of emotion

Jim and Andy - they are friends now forever

Livin' all time together
Jim and Andy.
Oh
Jim and Andy - flying over the ocean to the land of emotion
