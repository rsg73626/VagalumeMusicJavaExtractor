ONE OF A KIND (ENGLISH)

I'm just wild and young
I'm just wild and young
Do it just for fun

(Hello) My name is me and choice
(Hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm a bear that can do a lot of tricks - no, more like a fox
(Hello, hello, hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm an annoying snob
Cause I'm quite expensive
(Get out)

Yes hyung, yes noona (whats wrong with you?)
Ah, I'm just bored (hello?)
Yes hyung, yes noona, (what?s wrong with you?)
I'm sorry that I'm so popular

I'm there at just one phone call, number 1988-0818
Someone try to hold me back, I'm ranked number one
(or: Everyone knows me, I'm number one trouble maker
in the celebrity world)
Because I'm different, because that's me!
because no matter what I do, chaos ensues
because I create trends, because I change everything
This talent will never leave me

Get back, are you kidding with me? Young and rich
That describes me
So I'm fast so what is okay
Are you kidding me?
I'm not kidding you

(Hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm a bear that can do a lot of tricks - no, more like a fox
(Hello, hello, hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm an annoying snob
Cause I'm quite expensive
(Get out)

This is already my second album, I won't rob an empty house
My rap is what makes the ladies come to the bedroom -
Yeah, I'm busy
Money flower blooms on my business
I won't rest, my song makes everyone cry 
(or: my song stacks up more stories for buildings)

I love it!

This little boy comes out and owns the stage
Can't seem to like him, keep seeing him
Turn your eyes to avoid me but everywhere you go it's his music
My pics are everywhere, even when he's acting crazy
There's not enough copies to sell

Get back, I'm not kidding, Young and rich - that describes me
So I'm fast, so what's okay. Are you kidding with me?
I'm not kidding

La la la, look at me with loving eyes, don't curse me
La la la, please accept me, please love me

(Hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm a bear that can do a lot of tricks - no, more like a fox
(Hello, hello, hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm an annoying snob
Cause I'm quite expensive
(Get out)

Yes hyung, yes noona (what's wrong with you?)
Ah, I'm just bored
Yes hyung, yes noona, (what's wrong with you?)
I'm sorry that I'm so popular

Just follow me, follow me, just follow me, follow me,
Follow me follow me follow follow me follow follow me

(Hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm a bear that can do a lot of tricks - no, more like a fox
(Hello, hello, hello) Yes sir, I'm one of a kind
I'm an annoying snob
Cause I'm quite expensive
(Get out)
