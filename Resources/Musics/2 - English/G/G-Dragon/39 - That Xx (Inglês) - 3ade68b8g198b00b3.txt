THAT XX (INGLÃŠS)

Walking on the street, I bumped into your man (Yeah I saw him)
I didn't want to believe it, but my hunch turned out right (I told you)
He's not wearing that ring you gave him, there's another girl by his side
But I've said enough (I don't wanna hurt you)

Now you're getting angry with me (Why?)
You say "He's definitely not that kind of person" (Sure you're right)
Seeing your eyes, I reply that I probably got it wrong
See, I lied for you (I'm sorry)

I hate that you don't understand me
I hate all this waiting
Let go of his hand (break it off with him)
When you're sad, I feel like I'm dying

That XX, what does he have that I don't
Why can't I have you
That XX doesn't love you
How much longer are you going to cry yourself silly?

When you speak of him, you look so happy (you look happy)
It?s good that you can be this happy (I'm happy)
You say you really love him, want to be with him forever
You trust him completely (I don't know what to say no more)
Your friends all know that guy (yup they know)
It?s so obvious, why can't you see (it's you)
They say love is blind, Oh baby, you're so blind
Please, I beg you, break it off

Oh I hate that you don't understand me
I hate all this waiting
Let go of his hand (break it off with him)
When you're sad, I feel like I'm dying

That XX, what does he have that I don't
Why can't I have you
That XX doesn't love you
How much longer are you going to cry yourself silly?

Expensive cars, beautiful clothes, high-class restaurants, they all suit you well
But that XX beside you, he doesn't suit you, he really doesn't
He smiles like a hypocrite with you, brushing your face and hair
But he's thinking of another woman for sure, how dare he
The amount of tears you've cried, I want to make you happy by the same amount, baby
Rather than going through the pain alone, share some with me, baby
Please look at me, why can't you realise that I am your love
Why are you the only one who doesn?t know

That XX, what does he have that I don't
Why can't I have you
That XX doesn't love you
How much longer are you going to cry yourself silly?

That XX, what does he have that I don't
Why can't I have you
That XX doesn't love you
How much longer are you going to cry yourself silly?
