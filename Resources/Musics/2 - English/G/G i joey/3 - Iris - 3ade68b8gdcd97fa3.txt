IRIS

Iris

Just when you're in black
You look for something white
But if just look at him 
You can find

And all those strange things
That knock in your head will start to make sense
But if ou have no plain 
You can back to the start again

I knew a man who whote a letter to the sun 
And he said don't go away...

If only a simple thing like this 
Will turn you off through the rest of the week
You need to keep lucky 
'cos everyone will try to hold you in your sanaty

Even if you stop to wath TV
Nothing will change 
And if you have no plain
You can back to the start again

I knew a man who wrote a letter to the sun
And he said don't go away...
He lives at night but anybody know his name
Just the legend, just the legend...

I knew a man who whote a letter to the sun
And he said don't go away...
He lives at night but anybody know his name 
Just the legend, just the fucking legend...
