WE ARE THE MODERN

We are the Modern

They shoot in your face 
Flash lights and then
They ask you for more
You know what you’ve done
Oh, you’re not the only one
Who she is looking for 

Fantastic, incredible
We didn’t know what is trustful
And now we’re on a storm 
But everything change 
When we have in our hands 
Something strange and new

We are swimming in a pool of consequences
Drawing somethings that nobody understands   

They shoot in your face 
Red lights and then 
They bring you to the floor 
You’re building your life 
Knowing that after 
Everything will be destroyed

Fantastic, Amazing  
They kick they punch and they hate it
It seems so confuse now
We are the modern 
But without order 
Nothing will comes true 

We are swimming in a pool of consequences
Drawing things that nobody understands   
Following everything that make we get high
Leaving the last minute friends behind 

Love is hard 
Love is hard you are saying it
