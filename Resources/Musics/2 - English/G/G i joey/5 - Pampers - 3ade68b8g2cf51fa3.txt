PAMPERS

I will turn around the hard line of the time
And you need to believe me it's all that I can give you
The man with a hat in your door would be so romantic
And you just need to leave it's all that I can give you
Tonight

You don't want to tell me anythings that you like
No matter what I sad I can give good bye
I try and try to find the right way but I can't
No matter what I do I will play your game

Oh no! You don't believe but I can run
I'll stay outside of house now I have nothing to trust no...
Oh! you don't looking for a friend
You looking for a place to rest where anytime you lose your head

I will turn around the hard line of the time
And you need to believe me it's all that I can give you
I will show you all what I know about indie Rock'n'Roll
And you never understand

Oh no! You don't belive but I can run
I'll stay outside of house now I have nothing to trust no...
Oh! you don't looking for a friend
You looking for a place to rest where anytime you lose your head

Oh no! You don't belive but I can run
I'll stay outside of house now I have nothing to trust no...
Oh! you don't looking for a friend
You looking for spirituals help
Now I have nothing to tell you...
