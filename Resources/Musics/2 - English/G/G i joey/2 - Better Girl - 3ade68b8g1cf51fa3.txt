BETTER GIRL

Today is a different day
I know there is something in the air
Your friends waiting outside
They're not bad but they've drinked vodka

I like to see you beautiful
I like to see you happy by my side
I love when we have no time to back
That freedom to smile

I know they know they see you coming
I know they know girl you'll not be the only
I know they know they see you coming
I know they know girl you'll not be the...

That old feeling is a different feeling today
My head is open to make all that I never make

I like to see you beautiful
I like to see you happy by my side
I love when we have no time to back
That freedom to smile

I know they know they see you coming
I know they know girl you'll not be the only
I know they know they see you coming
I know they know girl you'll not be the...
