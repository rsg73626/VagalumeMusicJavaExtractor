KICK YOU OUT

If look at you you close your eyes 
  I'm not a fool because I look  at every 
  If you turn the tv on I'll turn the radio on
  Is not my fault if you're not so Rock'n'Roll

  When I take this you leave that
  Take or leave is all inside your head
  You love the sun I like the night
  What the hell are you doing by my side?

  I can see now!
  (you looking for more)
  I feel in my bones
  (you looking for more)

  You like theater I like action movies
  and all the things I do you disaprove
  You want stop me I wanna keep walking
  Don't make me think that "I can kick you out"

  I like The Beatles you like the Rolling Stones
  I like Nirvana and you like Guns'n'Roses
  I'm on the new age you're so classic
  You change your cloths but your head still in the past

  I wanna kick you out!

  I'll understand if hate me 
  But donÂ´t change what you have to do
  I wanna kiss you you wanna kiss me 
  But don't change what you have to do
