WEEKEND FRIENDS

When the buildings look so high
  And you don't know what you do
  In the city of broken hearts
  Cold streets will show you the way out

  You'll sing famous songs of unfamous bands
  At the night you feel so fine
  But you can't be lost
  If you don't care where you are
 
  'cause you don't know nothing
  You don't know my name
  Let's drink some coffe
  We can be friends

  Something change in your smile
  Maybe we need talk about interesant things
  You don't go to the left or right
  But follow me I'll stay out of this country

  'cause you don't know nothing
  You don't know my name
  Let's drink some coffe
  We can be friends
