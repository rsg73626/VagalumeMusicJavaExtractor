SMOKE TOWN

Smoke Town

We'll take to control
Don't pick up the fone
Just be careful...
Just be careful...
You don't want to go
You just wanna know
How your felling
How your felling

Dreams will make no sence
Scaping from your hands
How you do it 
How you do it
Remember what you've said
Before we getaway
Let's be strong 
There's nothing wrong

Let's go to the smoke town 
Top of the news 
Let's begin the plan like I knew
Let's go back to the smoke town 
Top of the news 

There's no other way
We can't make mistakes
Don't look back
Don't look back
Put love in your life 
Do it all the time
Say you want it
I know you want it 

We don't need to lie
You may say you're high
Just be careful...
Just be careful...
Is only another trip
Followed by a drink
It's so usual
When you do it 

Let's go to the smoke town 
Top of the news 
Let's begin the plan like I knew
Let's go back to the smoke town 
Top of the news 

Indie rock'n'roll

Just be careful...
You're so desesperate 
We just to say
Sheik your body
Sheik your body

We'll take he control
Don't pick up the fone
Just be careful...
Just be careful...
You don't want to go
