BALLADA G.I.LOVE

Ballada G.I.Love  

  Tell me where you go 
  And I tell you if there's good bands there 
  No matter what is wrong
  You won't lose the way back to home
  'cos anybory knows 
  But you have a special gift at it
  You can't just feel stronge 
  Only when everybody is looking at you

  Hey you're not alone
  If you look by your side we still here
  When the DJ play your sound 
  You'll feel your soul floating around the club
  There's not time for you to say bye
  I know some day you want it to try
  But now you can't go
  Sit down here and drink more wine

  'cos they can break your nose 
  But your mind is still close in a box
  They know it and come to take you down when your young
  But Paul don't belive just can decide I know...that's the time to G.I.Love

  Tell me where we go
  And I tell you if there's go drinks there
  No matter what is wrong you 
  Tonight you won't lose the way back to home   
  
...To G.I.Joey...
