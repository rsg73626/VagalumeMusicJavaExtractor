LIES POUR OUT

Lies pour out, but I know the truth [4x]
Lies pour out [2x]

Burn me with a safe sound when the words want you alone
The dreams and nightmares I have intend to get to you
Need to wrap a body, baby? We'll slip and take the heat
Lower guns; I'll lower mine and rip out your heartache

Now time to raise a glass in revenge
The cries of one thousand souls I'll avenge
You can hide behind your work in the road,
but your blackened past is bound to explode

Sing it!

Lies pour out, but I know the truth
Lies pour out, but you made me believe
Lies – In love were your words
Lies – The truth unfolds
Lies - In love was your words
Lies - The truth unfolds

The truth unfolds [2x]

I washed my hands in the Hell you've become
I hardly know you - hardly know you
We are never alone, in our hearts we are home
I hardly know you, hardly know you

I washed my hands in the Hell you've become
I hardly know you – hardly know you
I am never alone, in my heart I am home
In my heart I am home
