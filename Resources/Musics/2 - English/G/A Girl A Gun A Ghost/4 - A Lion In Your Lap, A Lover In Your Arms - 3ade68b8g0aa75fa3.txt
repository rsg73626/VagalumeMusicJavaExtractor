A LION IN YOUR LAP, A LOVER IN YOUR ARMS

This world is coming to an end, so a round for this whole room!
"Bloody Mary" uttered from their lips.
"Don?t worry son, she?ll be here soon
Crying ?Extra! Extra! The press profits off our doom!?"
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, only I can save us from this empty tomb.

Save me from this empty tomb? Save us from this empty tomb.

Who?s the weak one here? Whose eyes are screaming fear?
In my footsteps follows fire, you won?t find a weakness here.

I have the heart of a lion, baby, a lion.
There?s no time for crying, dying, baby, or lying.
I have the heart to win this war
If I only knew what I was fighting for.

What am I fighting for? What are we fighting for?

So saddle up kids it?s time to ride
On a horse named Death to meet your bride.
Saddle up, kids, it?s time to die.

This world is coming to an end, so a round for this whole room!
"Bloody Mary" uttered from their lips.
"Don?t worry son, she?ll be here soon
Crying ?Extra! Extra! The press profits off our doom!?"
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, I can save us from this tomb.
Black ties have gathered to provide the last soundtrack!
They?re all praying, they?re all preying; they won?t take their sins back.
The symphony is silent watching the seven trumpets?
Don?t follow me I cannot help the broken and the loveless.

They?re gonna break me down.

I give up. I cannot see the light.
I give in. I?m blinded by the night.
Rally ?round my broken standard,
See the sound of the broken and haggard.

There?s a black tie in her grip.

I shared my bed with a bomb?
They say, "Better to have loved and lost!"
But they never really loved at all.
Sulfur on my fingertips,
Bloody Mary on my lips.
