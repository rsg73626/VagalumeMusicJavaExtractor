WE COULD BE LOVERS

Ewan mcgregor (speaking): love is a many-splendored thing
Love lifts us up where we belong
All we need is love!
Nicole kidman (speaking): please, don't start that again...
Em: all you need is love
Nk(speaking): a girl has got to eat
Em: all you need is love
Nk(speaking): or she'll end up on the street
Em: all you need is love...
Nk: love is just a game
Em: i was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
Nk: the only way you're lovin' me baby
Is to pay a lovely fee...
Em: just one night, just one night
Nk: there's no way, cuz you can't pay
Em: in the name of love
One night in the name of love
Nk: you crazy fool
I won't give in to you
Em: don't... leave me this way
I can't survive without your sweet love
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Nk: you'd think that people
Would've had enough
Of silly love songs
Em: i look around me
And i see, it isn't so, no
Nk: some people wanna fall in love
With silly love songs
Em: well, what's wrong with that
I'd like to know
Cuz here i go again...
Love lifts us up where we belong
Where eagles fly from a mountain high
Nk: love makes us act like we are fools
Throw our lives away
For one happy day...
Em: we could be heroes, just for one day
Nk: you... you would be mean
Em(speaking): no, i won't!
Nk: and i... i'll drink all the time!
Em: we should be lovers!
Nk: we can't do that
Em: we should be lovers
And that's a fact
Nk: though nothing will keep us together
Em: we could steal time
Both: just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
We can be heroes, forever and ever
We can be heroes...
Em: just because i.... will always love you
Nk: i....
Both: and i'm glad it's... you
Nk: how wonderful life is...
Both: now you're in... the world...
