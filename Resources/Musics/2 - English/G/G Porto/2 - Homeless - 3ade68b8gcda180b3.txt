HOMELESS

I was falling, I was bruised
And you push me up
Like an angel, you saved me
All we had has gone
Did you promise you stay here
But I see you all around
Keep on waiting, please come back
Cause you took my heart

Homeless, homeless
What I'm feeling?
Homeless, homeless
keep on dreaming
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I still lookin for
For million days and million nights
Homeless, homeless
What I'm feeling?
Homeless, homeless
keep on dreaming
Yeah Yeah Yeah

You said when the storm came
You would protect me but it was in vain
You said you stay all around
Then where you at?
Where you at now?
Did you promise you stay here?
Cause I see you all around
Keep on waiting, please come back
Cause you took my heart

Homeless, homeless
What I'm feeling?
Homeless, homeless
keep on dreaming
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I still lookin for
For million days and million nights
Homeless, homeless
What I'm feeling?
Homeless, homeless
keep on dreaming
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I still looking for
For million days and million nights
I still looking for until the end of time
