MORE THAN VIP FEAT. SHINE

What will I do tonight?
I feel alone, don't know where to go
Whatever at day or night I wanna have fun (have fun)
Forget the problems and let it done
My body wanna talk, talk
My body wanna move, move
Let's do it tonight
Let's do it tonight
Dance, party, let's go guys and girls
Dance, party, let's go guys and girls
Dance, party, guys and girls
Dance, party, guys and girls
Dance, party, guys and girls
V. I. p

Dance, dance, dance, dance!
I wanna disappear
Dance, dance, dance, dance!
Do you wanna be with me?
Dance, dance, dance, dance!
Until the morning light
Release your vibe inside
And take you time, don't mind
