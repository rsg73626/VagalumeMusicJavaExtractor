MISS U

Sometimes I need you more than ever
Sometimes I hate you more than I can
Sometimes I love you more than myself but
Sometimes I really wish you here

Chorus
I can't scream your name
I can't let you free
I can't live without you
I don't know if I still loving you
But if I miss u, I do
I miss every moment by your side
I miss every kiss, every hug, every smile

Oh Oh Oh oh Oh oh Oh

I've been trying but it hasn't been easy
I don't know how can I live this way?
Please don't refuse my trutly feelings
I can't stand this pain is insane

Please don't forget
I need you more
Please don't regret
Cu's I miss u
I Miss U
