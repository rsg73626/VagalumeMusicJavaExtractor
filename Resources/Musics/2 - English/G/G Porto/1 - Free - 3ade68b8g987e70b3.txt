FREE

The moon heralds the beginning
Tonight I know I will carry me
Can you contain this feeling?
Then run away or you can follow me
Uh we were meant to fly, flying through the sky
Uh we're the only colors shining bright into the sky
You and I, we rule the night

Chorus
Can you hear me?
Hear me talk, hear me sing, right now
Even if the stars stop shining in the dark
Keeps the flame burning inside your heart
Scream and shout, spread your wings
If you don't know what I mean
We just wanna be free
