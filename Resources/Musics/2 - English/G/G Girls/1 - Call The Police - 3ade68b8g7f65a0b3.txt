CALL THE POLICE

[Verse 1: Antonia]
Got my heels so high in the satellite
Got me tip toe walking on the moonlight
Who's there, who's not, who's busy, busy
Who cares? You don't, you're with me, with me
Better walk, get the lights, finger-licking good
We're drinking with the bouncers,, it sounds good
Who's love, who's there, who's itty bitty?
Who's drunk, who's not, you're silly, silly

[Pre-Chorus: Inna]
These boys running from me, I'm cold as ice
And these boys can come if they're lonely
They can roll the dice
These boys, they don't know me, like kryptonite
Cause these toys come with a warning, warning

[Chorus: All]
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm so hot)
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm hot, hot)
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm so hot)

[Verse 2: Lori]
Get your hands up high like a bonfire
Bad girl with a tattoo, bad boy ya
Who's there, who's not, who's busy, busy
Who care? I don't, they're with me, with me
Just all these fans can't get enough
They crawl, they shout, they push it up
Who's creep, who's clap, who's silly, silly?
Who's drunk, who's not, you'll silly, silly

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
These boys running from me, I'm cold as ice
And these boys can come if they're lonely
They can roll the dice
These boys, they don't know me, like kryptonite
Cause these boys come with a warning, warning

[Chorus: All]
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm so hot)
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm hot, hot)
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm so hot)

[Bridge: Inna & Alexandra Stan]
I'm not fun, I'm just dangerous
It's not easy when you ride with me
Come get some, it's so obvious
Freeze, unfreeze, call them for me

[Chorus: All]
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm so hot)
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm hot, hot)
Somebody better call the police on me
Somebody better call the police (I'm so hot)
