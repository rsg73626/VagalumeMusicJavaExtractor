MILK & HONEY

[Verse 1: Lariss]
Baby, baby, your honey and milkshake
Makes me wanna love you three times
Baby, baby, let's go away
Where I've never been in my life

[Pre-Chorus 1: Antonia]
I like when your lips taste like a candy kiss
Sprinkle a little on mine, yeah
I might look like it's cool but in my head
You already love me three times

[Chorus: Inna]
So baby, mix the milk and honey
Keep them coming, if you wanna love me
I can see the look in your eyes
I can't wait to leave this party with your honey
Put your body on me, promise
I'll love you three times

[Verse 2: Lori]
Baby, baby, all eyes on you
Your sweet honey blowing my mind
Baby, baby, I'm looking at you
All I want is rumble so right

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lariss & Inna]
So baby, give me what you want
I bring my G Girls around and we're like
We wanna taste the milk and honey
We wanna taste a little bit
The milkshake on your lip
And I'm like, "Go and get it, G Girls! "

[Chorus: Antonia]
So baby, mix the milk and honey
Keep 'em coming, if you wanna love me
I can see the look in your eyes
I can't wait to leave this party with your honey
Put your body on me, promise
I'll love you three times

[Bridge: Antonia]
Oh, na na na, what a feeling
Love it when you hold me
Control my body, love me
Never ever leave me

[Pre-Chorus: Inna]
I like when your lips taste like a candy kiss
Sprinkle a little on mine, yeah
I might look like it's cool but in my head
You already love me three times

[Chorus: Lori]
So baby, mix the milk and honey
Keep them coming, if you wanna love me
I can see the look in your eyes
I can't wait to leave this party with your honey
Put your body on me, promise
I'll love you three times
