THE PLUG

Young niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, make it and get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it my price you can't beat it

We move the work like it's water
Stuff a quarter in your daughter
Cash flow like the nile
I mean like right across the border
You to get it, I got it if I ain't got it, I get it
Fill your spot up with product
I got the straps for your hitters
Look at my price is my price

Fuck is ya estimate nigga
Your ass down when
I'm pulling up cuz I'm blessing
Figure you bite the bullet, I bang it
Get to bustin', it's nothin'
Wave it, blaze it
Hit the bulls eye I don't graze shit

Ap around me lately
C notes serenade me
The smell made me crazy
Product of the eighties
Numero uno
I'm out a legendary group oh
My souls too cold
They blocking me, I found a loophole

I'm new gold
I got a couple dimes from panama
I make a little girl out an amazon (amazon)
Run on me, I'm squeezin' like an anaconda
Then I'm gone, years from now
I bet my power steer my lawn

If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it
My price you can't beat it

I believe I was born to ball
Penetrate the pussy, unless
It smell like old tennis balls
I'm a rapper I got a problem being punctual
A mil at 26 man these other rappers man they got to go
They even think they on my level
Sports illustrated model all in my condo
Ice in the pot
In the trap, I'm so mix a lot
Bout to spend a mill on a car lot

Streets dried up
Get tied up for small packs
Niggas workin' phone wired up, don't call back
I'm a surgeon; I put shit back together
I determined to bring my black mac wherever
Niggas lurkin' this ain't the place to be
Fuck a hit
Niggas blow up your face for free
Sunday sermon, preacher keep on facin' me
It's like every word he sayin' just relates to me

If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it
My price you can't beat it

G-unit gorilla
Cocaine car wheeler
50 Grand cash to the car dealer
Bragging on what you
Bought get you raw quicker
Tap you on the shoulder like take this walk nigga
I fought every tall nigga short temper
Tougher than leather cut
From a different cloth nigga

You ain't a boss you can afford
To pay the costs nigga
Get caught cuz I was taught
To never talk nigga
Young niggas need straps
Then get at me I'm the plug
Well, if you need that
Then get at me I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, make it
And get at me I'm the plug
Holla when you need it my price
You can't beat it
