A peice of the game board
R to elivers bout as long as a chainsaw
Im wide awake but it still feelz like im dreamin
40 calbz under my pillow condom fillin my semen
Physical presence a female a form of a demon thats y i
Fuck em n leave em get my nut wile im breathin
They thought they caught me slippin now im duckin n drippin
Thats a thousand dolla outfit wat the fuck is u rippin u trippin
Get rede go get my ass in position
Death waits for no religion wether caltholic or chrisitan
I went thru mama bitchin in n out tha kitchen
Wit probable cause n probables in n out the prison
U got soilders but u still gotta respect tha heartz
We got for 4 5z n 9z then a deck of cardz

U can take me out the hood but cant take the hood out me
