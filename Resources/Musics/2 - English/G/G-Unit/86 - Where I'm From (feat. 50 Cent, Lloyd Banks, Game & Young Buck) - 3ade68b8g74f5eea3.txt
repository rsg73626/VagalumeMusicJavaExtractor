WHERE I'M FROM (FEAT. 50 CENT, LLOYD BANKS, GAME & YOUNG BUCK)

[50 Cent:]
In my hood when you young 
You tuck and handle your biz nigga 
Coming from where I'm from where I'm from 
Stick up kids will run up in your mammas crib nigga 
Comin from where I'm from where I'm from 
Oh this is some lil shit niggas 'll split ya fuckin wig nigga 
Comin from where I'm from where I'm from 
Expect no commissary when your ass doin your bid nigga 
Comin where I'm from where I'm from 

[Lloyd Banks:]
I'm from New York City 
Eyes on the prize 
Dodging the worm 
I'll fry your head like a project perm 
Bullets burn 
My right hands in the urn 
How the hell did I deserve to be placed in a situation with nobodys concern 
Cursed the coward thats bragin and didn't clap they mark 
He deserve a beating faster than a fat mans heart 
I play my part well respected 
Every minute every second 
You'll put a dent in your budget bugging me for a record 

[50 Cent:]

Coming from where I'm from where I'm from

Comin from where I'm from where I'm from 
Oh this is some lil shit niggas 'll split ya fuckin wig nigga 
Comin from where I'm from where I'm from 
Expect no commissary when your ass doin your bid nigga 
Comin where I'm from where I'm from 

[Young Buck:]
Cashville is what I call home 
Just know when to call on 
It's every man for himself 
I come from the bottom 
I been to niggas behind the trigga and been in front of the bullet 
But where I'm from we dont think about it we pull it 
Crips and bloods in Cali they got these country niggas bangin 
Ain't no more hangin 
Nigga what set is u claimin 
Round here money aint comin like it used to be 
Cuz these teens killin fiends over half a g

[The Game:]
West side Compton motherfuckers 
This three wheelin ass scrapin 
100 spoke gold daytons 
Home of the Lakers 
We ridin dubs like Payton 
Bandana 45 cock it back how the tips gon fly 
You bitch niggas go run and hide 
It's NWA till the day I die 
Purple haze I get high 
Were the beef at im ready to ride 
allstar game don't come outside 
little drama and it's gonna be a homicide 
lowridin through the CPT banks ridin shotgun 
buck in the backseat g-unit pops on
