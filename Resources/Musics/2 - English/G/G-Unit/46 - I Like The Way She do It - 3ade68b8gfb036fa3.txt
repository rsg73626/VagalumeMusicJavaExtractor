I LIKE THE WAY SHE DO IT

(Bridge) 50 Cent 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it 

(Chorus) 50 Cent 
I Said 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Let that ass drop, like my '64 
I Said 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Let that ass drop, like my '64 

(Verse 1) 
I suppose to blow, you suppose to know 
Not to go against me or it R.I.P 
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money 
I'm special wit it, I got special bread 
It's easy now, please believe me now 
I dismiss a hoe, please leave me now 
I f**k when I want, I do what I like 
She want the same shit I want, the bitch is a dike 
She a super freak, the freak of the week 
I give her something a suck, she give her something to eat 
It never enough, she like it rough 
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen 

(Bridge) 50 Cent 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it 

(Chorus) 50 Cent 
I Said 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Let that ass drop, like my '64 
I Said 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Let that ass drop, like my '64 

(Verse 2) Tony Yayo 
I need a dollar for every time that my heart beat 
Now how much it that 
I can breath on a track and make money, ahha ahha 
Now how much is that 
I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini 
I'm in ??????, where the girls are freaky 
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me 
Ma I love it when you lie & say my eyes are dreamy 
I'm in the club frontin, I'm in the club stuntin' 
10 Grand to buy the bar, Ma it ain't nothing 

(Verse 3) Lloyd Banks 
If home girl wit it, I'm get it, hit it, split it 
She'll think about me everyday, hour, minute 
Second to nobody, baby check it 
you look as good as your chess 
And when your neck it, I'm ready to f**k 
A little head in the truck 
If a turn gang good, i'ma let her come up 
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town 
Stash box down, put the magnum down 
I'm with G-Unit, 
Nigga you not ballin a the G 2 jet 

(Bridge) 50 Cent 
I Like the Way she do it 
I Like the Way she do it

(Verse 4) Young Buck 
She got a nigga on the count down 
Waitin on it like... Three, two, one 
Yea right now 
You got skills on them high heels 
When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live 
Do me before I get her 
I might eat out depending on how I feel 
Baby girl got a thang for me 
She do what every I say 
and I ain't got to make it rain money 
Go getta and she ghetto with it 
Told shawty dont do it, but she already did it 
I'm all on her back, when she move like that 
You can find me where every she at 


(Chorus) 50 Cent 
I Said

Then she drop it low, to gets the doe 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Let that ass drop, like my '64 
I Said 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe 
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it 
Let that ass drop, like my '64
