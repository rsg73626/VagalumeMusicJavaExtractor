YOU NOT READY

[Young Buck] (chorus)

You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me
(no) 
You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me
(no)
You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me
(no)
It's G-Unit and we bout to get this fuckin hoe

[50 cent] 
Yea nigga I'm the first one up
I heard you been talking mad shit 
why dont you just step the fuck up
Get in my face and see whats happens 
I'll take you out you wont know what happened like poof its magic
yea I pull magic tricks im like B rabbit
I beat the hell out of all you faggots
I do it big just like a real savage
Game wanna mess wit us we'll do it back
Fuck all this 'get rid of beef' ya'll heard that 
You wanna know whats happens when you mess wit G-Unit 
You get dropped,shot and punched in yo shit bitch

(chorus)

[Lloyd Banks]

Uhh Yea 
Sit down 50 man let me get on this nigga 
he talkin like he a G 
But he dont wanna see me in the streets
niggas get capped up, smacked up and killed 
I like to do it gangsta style yea I do it for real
I'll be yo dentist get yo chest filled Wit bullets
Yea yo plan failed to ruin the G-units name
Lets do it like trina and stop playin games
Im'a spit heat flashes make you look like a lame
And when I head in the club hoe's give me they name
I'll do it like lil flip and say
You a lame so yo dame must be playin mind games
If you think you mess wit G-unit
Think about we go in the streets and handle our bussiness

(chorus)

[Tony yayo]
Im back on that gansta shit
When Im in the streets ya'll know who Im wit
G-unit we kill nigga's that talk shit
The Game has gott'n so selfish
We the one's who put him on the map
Take this track rewind it like Boom Boom Clap
And you'll find out who's goin get ya
we always goin be on 106&park like yo twin Big Tigga
I hope you figured out why we made this song
Cuz you really don't want to fuck wit us we king kong

(chorus to a fade)
