I got my pistol in my lap, and the top drop down
An ak in the back cuz a nicca hot now
And i been shooting, and i been robbing
Fifty telling niccas im a mutherfuckin problem [gun shot]
I come from the bottom, but birds i gotem
I ?grip? two cents in harlem, serve allem
To me what i deserve man
Fuck what you heard man
They doing a ?ten n key?
So who tha real wurd man
They try to stop us, but i load up my choppa
Put my eye in tha scope and popem right in their pajamas [gun shot]
Do what we say so is waitin on yayo
So we can double back and give the fans what they paid for
Ever since the game came back to reality
These niccas that aint sellin, they mad at me, but had at me
Then, i take it right back tha block
And tennessee, we known to put tha pirates on the pot

The first down south nicca getting popping on the east coast

Gotta keep my  heat cloaked just incase we bump headz
