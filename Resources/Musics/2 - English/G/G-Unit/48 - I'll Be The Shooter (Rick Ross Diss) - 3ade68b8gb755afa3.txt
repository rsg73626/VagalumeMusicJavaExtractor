I'LL BE THE SHOOTER (RICK ROSS DISS)

[Chorus]
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll use the Colt, the Taurus, or the Ruger
I'll pop some through ya
Dirty is what I'll do ya
I-I'll use the Sig, the pump, or the German Luger [2x]

[50 Cent]
I-I'll be the shooter
I'll bang out
I-I'll bang out
Find out shit is real when im atchu wid that thang out
Cause all kinda commotion when a nigga get blast on
The spot he get his cash on
Let off with no mask on
Pussy ya heart pumpin but ya brain gone
Leave somethin sweet
I'll snatch the heat and get the flame goin'
I stuff two different calibur shells in my revolver
.38 and .32 long ones, you gotta problem
Start me, I'll never stop
I'm layin atcha momma spot
Squeeze till the llama hot
I'll have ya ass in drama op
I cause havoc if you come in my vacinity
Muthafuck the police
Officer Rick the enemy

[Chrous]
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll use the Colt, the Taurus, or the Ruger
I'll pop some through ya
Dirty is what I'll do ya
I-I'll use the Sig, the pump, or the German Luger [2x]

[LLoyd Banks]
Its been deeper than rap
I eat shit, go to sleep with my gat
Its us three against the industry
Lets keep it like that
Click-clack, getcha goons
Fuck all the talkin
Niggas yappin bout who dress the best
Get em Gucci coffins
When we tombstone, bullets hurt
40s break a few bones
Come around, ya food
And my shawtys takin jewels home
Follow em then hallow em
Take two these and gaggle em
You ride wid em you die wid em
Chances of survival thin
The sharks is out you divin in?
Dare you niggas try to swim
Theres no odds, I gotta win
And wobble em with the whop-whop
Shady backgrounds, you prolly with the cops
You aint street, you needa stop
I breathe the hood, I be the block

[Chrous]
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll use the Colt, the Taurus, or the Ruger
I'll pop some through ya
Dirty is what I'll do ya
I-I'll use the Sig, the pump, or the German Luger [2x]

[Tony Yayo]
Niggas wanna kill me
I'm gettin money for God sakes
That purple-urple fucked Phelps up with Cornflakes
Kick in the door man, spray the 44 man
That mortitian morg man
Fill you with straws man
Black President, I voted for Obama
I voted in the hood so I voted with my llama
Everyday is drama
Everyday is karma
He got shot last week
So lets press his baby momma
This is home of the bolders
Adolesence wil'in
Shawty got killed for bear sneakers on the island
Maybach music, ya niggas want trouble?
I run up on that CO snap his ass on the double

[Chrous]
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll be the shooter
I-I'll use the Colt, the Taurus, or the Ruger
I'll pop some through ya
Dirty is what I'll do ya
I-I'll use the Sig, the pump, or the German Luger [2x]
