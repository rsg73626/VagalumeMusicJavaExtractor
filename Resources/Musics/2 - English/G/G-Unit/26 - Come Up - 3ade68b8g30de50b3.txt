COME UP

Yeah, I'm that paper chasing, money making hustler
Nigga, you know how I get down
Big dreams, big bags of bread
Big money, you fucking with the kid
Watch a nigga come up
Inf beams, triple beams it seems
The street niggas know just what I mean
Watch a nigga come up

Born hustler, niggas got to get paid
Shit real from the cradle to the grave
Watch a nigga come up
Got to get it, we got, got to get it
Got the bread for the hit, nigga, we with it
Watch a nigga come up

Whenever you should wanna have it, do you need me
Drug dealer jewelry, standing on 3d
Double my dose, this a lotto high
Check my vienne here, model cry
My autograph is a dollar sign
This jamaica stars, cream dreams, my paper large
Had to erase all loss, propellers, I'm taking off
Steaming potent, I'm illegal rowing
My holy flow keep the demons folding
24k, my team is glowing

Yeah, step in with my strap on me
Racks on me in this whole-in-the-wall club with 100 packs on me
Got the goons out, you know we don't do much
Catch you coming out the club if you doing too much
Couple cubans on my neck, smoking a cuban on the jet
On my way to collect from niggas that's losing bets
Joe pesci, baby, I enforce the rules
Take two's and tighten up niggas with loose screws

Your bitch wanna be my bitch
She saying we friends, I done fucked her again
Now watch a nigga come up, watch a nigga come up
Grinding, diamond shining, drop the climbing and we doing it big
Watch a nigga come up, watch a nigga come up

Feels like hawaii going through this car wash
Get the foreign, you know I gotta get the boss
Ar green beamer size of kevin hart
These 22 jump street niggas talk
Watch a nigga come up off this trap phone
Cold jeans hold the coke five flex roam
In the clouds care less about the chit chatter
Bad bitches don't fuck these soundcloud rappers

One, two, buck 'em out them seven shoes
Pockets full of revenue, kitchen filled of residue
Pitching on the avenue, million dollar attitude
Fuck you, pay me, I don't show gratitude
Told that ho bring it back, rewind it
Now I got her on my mic beatboxing
Ye ain't gotta look for it, we got it
Get it hard, break it down, cut then rewatch it

Big dreams, big bags of bread
Big money, you fucking with the kid
Watch a nigga come up
Inf beams, triple beams it seems
The street niggas know just what I mean
Watch a nigga come up
Born hustler, niggas got to get paid
Shit real from the cradle to the grave
Watch a nigga come up
Got to get it, we got, got to get it
Got the bread for the hit, nigga, we with it
Watch a nigga come up

I got the kind of success that's hard to measure
Tear the unit apart, put it back together
I'm strong, I ain't mentioning what I'm benching
I'm merrill lynching in the mall, I'll blow ya pension
Sharp as a blade, tom ford suave
Sneaker collection same color of grenade
Camoflage, damn I'm large, oh God
Aventador door lambo, hop in and just push start
I go 0 to a 100, nigga, real quick
You talk money, I got money, it's real shit
It's independent, now we eating of a big plate
First week I make a million off my mixtape
Hello, you niggas is slow, you gotta catch up
You business savvy, you gotta step up
You new like a ho, I don't understand ya
'Til you eating the cheese, ratting on camera

Big dreams, big bags of bread
Big money, you fucking with the kid
Watch a nigga come up
Inf beams, triple beams it seems
The street niggas know just what I mean
Watch a nigga come up
Born hustler, niggas got to get paid
Shit real from the cradle to the grave
Watch a nigga come up
Got to get it, we got, got to get it
Got the bread for the hit, nigga, we with it
Watch a nigga come up
