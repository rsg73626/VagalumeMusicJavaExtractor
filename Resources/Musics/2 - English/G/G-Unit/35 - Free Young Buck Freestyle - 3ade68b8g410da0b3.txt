FREE YOUNG BUCK FREESTYLE

Yeah let's take this shit back, uh
(whoo kid!) y'all remember that right?
This buck, cashville, y'all know

Uh, way back in the day
Deep, deep down south
Where the nigga had a lil pack of yay
Cause the nigga with the big ak
Tryna rob everybody round here where I stay
Back then I was at your house party
Had your little sister on the walk in loose
Pour a little hen in the punch in the juice
Used to take a one on one back
Then for a boost
Couldn't step in the booth
Talk that shit
Nigga had to know you was the truth
Couldn't lie what your life bout
Had to tell these folk
What you really gon' do
The rap game on some other shit
They ain't tellin' what they doin'
Tellin' what they gon' do
Get caught up with a couple bricks
And guess what nigga, they tellin' on you
See I'm still on this scarface shit
Gotta kill these niggas, you tellin' on who?
I can't just turn my back on the trap
I'm out here sellin' it too
I'm connected all in cali
Pounds of the kush, we lettin' it through
And a nigga tryna spread the love
So what y'all niggas really ready to do?

I'm just tryna bring it
Back to the master p days
Make the pot say, ughh
Make the pot say, ughh
I can bring it back like, ughh
I'm just tryna bring it
Back to the master p days
Make the pot say, ughh
Make the pot say, ughh
I can bring it back like, ughh

You bout it? yeah
I'm bout it, bout it, you know
Ay where you from homie?
You know that dirty south gangsta shit
Ay put your hood up

I represent, it's g-unit gang
Country nigga all in queens sellin' cocaine
I fuck that white girl, I push that dog food
I know ways to make sure
We get it all through
I fuck with gang members
That's gon' die about it
I fuck with lean sippers
That's gon' die without it
You got it? cause I got it, got it
I roll with the windows up, cloudy, cloudy
Shit chill, I got bricks here
Sellin' dope out the house and I live there
So many came to the south think I kill here
I'm just tryna figure out why I'm still here

Ay let me hit that
I'm bout to elevate, elevation
Tryna elevate on you niggas

Switchin' positions in this (?)
I'm all in tucson
Tryna meet this cuban
He not the plug but he said he knew some
You're gonna have to keep your mouth closed
If I let you come
If I get you this I'm gon' have
To kill ya if you run
Posted in the front of the church
Pew with two guns
Prayin' that the lord
Let me make it through with these 2 tons
Knowin' niggas with me just
To see if I give you one
Funny how when you get rich niggas
Think that you dumb
Where you from?
Where I'm from murder's always the outcome
Your strap is like your everything
You can't leave home without one
Man they got me puttin'
My gun in the hand of my son
Somebody come in this house
Then y'all gon' see what I done
Why I'm keepin' so much reefer
Now in my lungs
I tell 'em I've been pitchin'
On probation for the last three years
Yes memph we hot right now, yes we is
Is 2pac missed nigga? yes he is

Hey man I never seen
Seen so many people this point
Man in my life homie
I'm one of those people
It's all the real niggas
That's not here no more
Rest in peace

First you here, before you know it
It's too late y'all
Close your eyes then you think
About nate dogg
Lil flat, lord infamous, they died real
Dj screw, fat pat, pimp c died trill
Soulja slim, doe b
Now all the ladies drop left eye left tear
Big pun, biggie smalls, a$ap yams too
Eazy-e, odb, man this can't be true
Gang starr, mac dre, jam master j
Heavy d, slim dunk, and he was from the a
Static nature, lil wayne had him on his way
Lil snupe, I seen him with meek
Just the other day
It's okay y'all the truth here
I know eminem feelin' like me
We wish proof was here
Obituary like a souvenir
We just look at 'em
And reminisce about when you was here

Somebody pour up, yeah
I ain't fuck with that old fake ass
Purp they got out here right now
Give me the red hi-tec
Shit ain't no actavis
Yessir, three 6 mafia featuring
Ugk up in this joint
We about to sip on this sizzurp
(there's about to be a
Whole lotta sippin' it up
Pourin' it up, drankin' it up
Goin' round here in the est boy)
Y'all know how we do it
(now pour it on up)
Oh and I fuck with the yellow too

Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp

I'm still poppin' these pills
I ain't new to this
I put yellow (?) on big old blunts
Of cannabis
I sip hi-tec by the pint
Tryna see just how high I can get
It's an embarrassment just to hear
A nigga say "I quit"
Yeah that actavis I like
But I can't pay for that fake shit
Don't know what's that in your sprite
Woah purp niggas make me sick
She said "buck you takin' flight"
Least that molly got me right
Plus these niggas doin'
All this snitchin' baby I've been outta (whoo)
I've just been sippin' on some sizzurp

Yeah you know they was countin' me out
I was so well countin' up in (?)
Whole world countin' on me
It's buck, yeah (whoo kid)
Haha, yeah
