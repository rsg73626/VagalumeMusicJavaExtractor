COMIN THRU

Glock check, ak check
Sawed off shotgun, check
You know I'm sayin' we got all that shit
G-unit nigga we comin' through
There nigga know that
Fuck you mean?
Yellow tape that bitch out nigga
You know what's up boy

I ain't that famous
I could still murk somethin'
I still I hurt somethin'
I still got the work comin'
Hard headed ain't learned
Nothin' but drug money
Blue bandanas with a pocket
Full of blood money
Load the shells with my shirt
To keep the prints off 'em
Go get a rental, put in work
And take the tits off her
Nigga do your dirt and still ridin' clean
Big. 45 stuffed inside these designer jeans
Called buck, I need a verse that's an m16
Fuck you mean? how you want it?
With the red beam?
From cashville to new orleans
Boy we all through there
Ay kidd, you know I'm comin' through
Don't give a fuck who there

Just call me when you need me nigga
You know I'm comin' through there
You ain't gotta wait to see me nigga
You know I'm comin' through there
Just call me when you need me nigga
You know I'm comin' through there
You ain't gotta wait to see me nigga
You know I'm comin' through there
