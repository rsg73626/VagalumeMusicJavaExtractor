YOU SO TOUGH

T.O.S.

[50 Cent]
Nigga you so tough 
Tough until ya heartbeat stop 
The trey-pound pop 
Ya arteries shot 
Ya bleedin and shout 
Get in the pine box 
Damn yous a hard muthafucka 
You so tough 
Tough until ya punkass hit 
The four-fifth kick 
The hypla spit 
You in deep shit 
Now yo ass sit 
You supposed to be hard muthafucka 
You so tough 

[Lloyd Banks]
Bury all ya hatin 
Cause hatred'll bury ya 
Learn not to talk tough talk through ya cellular 
Fuck gettin beef 
The president the senetor 
There is no peace 
You the prey or the pretedor 
While ya plottin on me 
I'm 10 steps aheada ya 
Black 40 calibur 
I'll putta infer-red on ya 
Nigga I'm special 
You mad cause you regular 
Man I don't want yo bitch 
I damn near remember her 
Refresh my memory? 
Oh yeah, I slept wid her 
No wonder she ain't mention you 
When I met wid her 
Mind on my chedda 
They remember me forever 
The groundwork I put in 
Make my lifestyle better... and better 
I like the fuckin street 
Right in them phantom lights 
Montana life 
Two women 
And my hand is ice 
But I don't forget where I come from

For that china white 
I'll lay a nigga momma down 
We can shoot it out 
Like Frank White did in Chinatown 
You know I got that hard white 
You know I got that tannin brown 
Automatic trey-pound 
Leave a nigga maned-down 
Murda murda homicide 
Real right niggas ride 
Gangstas, they never hide 
Thank God I'm still alive 
My pockets look like there's cracks on me 
My waist looks like I got the mac on me 
These hoes on my dick I got that axe on me 
You a R.N. 
Regular nigga that rap homie 
I'm crack homie 
I'm dope money 
I wake up and wipe my ass wid coke money 
C-back, Maybach 
My shit two-toned 
Nigga run up on that 
Yo ass a tombstone 
I'm wood like a group home 
Ghetto like a payphone 
Jake the snake 
I'm low in the hood

Yeah I got a knife for a tough nigga 
Nine for a hard nigga 
Don't make me empty the chamber 
Even if I'm locked in a cell block 
You'll fall into shell shock 
When I open ya head wid the banger 
I cause a riot in the yard 
Make a mess in the mess hall 
Like I jus blew trial 
And I ain't got nothin left 
God, what's todays mathematics? 
Shit ain't addin up 
Get knocked wid 10 machine guns 
Only get 12 months? 
Ooohh weee, don't talk to me 
You talk to him, you talkin to them 
I got the best lawyers money can buy 
They said they woulda got me ten 
Or maybe nine 
I say "how do you explain how homie breathe? " 
He say "you keep ya mouth shut or you in wid G's"
