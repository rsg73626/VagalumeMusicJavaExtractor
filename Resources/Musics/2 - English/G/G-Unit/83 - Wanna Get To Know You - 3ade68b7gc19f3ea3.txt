WANNA GET TO KNOW YOU

by: t0rIt0


[Chorus]

I wanna be your lawyer
I really wanna defend you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy

[Young Buck]

Im lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]

Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Qonder why I call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spall her
Hickups annoy ya from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wed down
Next door neighboors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]

(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla night

[Chorus]

I wanna be your lawyer
I really wanna defend you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I really need to stand you, baby
I wannt be your lover
I really need to stand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.
