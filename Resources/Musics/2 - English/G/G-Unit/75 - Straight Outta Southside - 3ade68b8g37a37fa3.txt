STRAIGHT OUTTA SOUTHSIDE

T.O.S.

[Lloyd Banks:] 
Straight outta Sideside 
Crazy muthafucka named Bank-o 
Crack rap, million dolla bankroll 
Black Lac, for my outta state ho 
These niggas talk gangsta 
But really ain't tho 
I'm a stormy night, you a rainbow 
I'm a G, tight clothes ain't my thang bro 
Fuck the Police with an HIV carrier 
No vaseline in the M-16 
I'm ridin dirty but the Bent pimp clean 
And gotta body like I feed it creatine 
My birth stone in diamond, my favorite color's green 
I smoke lean and piss Louis the XIII 

[Yayo:] 
My name is Yayo 
A crazy nigga he don't play tho 
I hitcha planters peanut with the .80 
Al Qaeda expert merkin 
When all my niggas die 
They gon have 80 virgins 
I'm the 'Burb swervin 
Cause I'm drunk and I'm high 
With that glock and pump, that mac and .45 
Fuck the police they killed Sean Bell 
Fuck the FEDS I still deal fishscale 
Mini me niggas wanna copy my style 
But legal aid lawyers ain't good for trial 
Pull up to the projects and throw the kids 100's 
Drop top Phantom got him sick in his stomach 

[50 Cent:] 
Nigga it's Boo-Boo 
But you can call me 50 
Fuck with me the police will have to get me 
760 I-I ride I'm a rider 
Molsotov, I toss that, you on fire 
Beef pop, I'll stop talkin n get quiet 
Put the muzzle on the Tech look like it's on fire 
My gun jammed and unjammed like I planned it 
Like I was jus takin a breather I'm back blamming 
I'm Charles Bronson, Dirty Harry with the cannon 
You shootin back, but u ain't hittin 
Shit I'm still standing 
When shit don't go down smooth I don't panic 
Switch pistol, switch hands, switch targets hit ya man

Yea, nigga I'm straight outta southside 
I'm back on dat gorilla shit, dat cold hearted killa
shit 
Stunt witcha mouth wide 
We move around militant 
We trained for some iller shit 
Southside
