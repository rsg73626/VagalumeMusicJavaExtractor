DON'T TELL 'EM

Shawty my type tonight, you know I'm kind of picky
She saying ''I love new york'', I'm saying ''welcome to my city''
Corporate type, I'm finna strip her to her vicky's
She about her business, why you think she fucking with me?
I could smoke to the rhythm, see I'm really not a dancer
G-unit plus jeremih equal summertime anthem
It's hot now, time to put the top down
I'm here, girl, I'm coming around your block now

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl, I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you don't even, don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, you don't even, you don't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You don't even, don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You don't even, you don't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em

Know you say you down with it
Won't tell 'em how you hit the ground with it
Girl, you know I'm from chicago, I act a fool, bobby brown with it
In it, nobody take me out though
You got gifts, bring 'em down the south pole
Marathon doll, I'm puttin' miles
Don't you worry 'bout it, might gon' work it out
Only is you got me feeling like this oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

Don't tell 'em I be around this bitch
Got you doing all kinds of freaky shit, making flicks
(Don't tell 'em)
Don't tell 'em I be in your front door
Then I'm in your backdoor on all fours
Don't tell 'em cause a nigga would be heartbroken
Chest out, stressed out, nigga start smoking
I ain't trippin', I am chillin', I ain't illin'
I ain't thinkin' about no nigga in his feelings

They gon' try to break us up, don't let 'em
Half of these hoes never rode in a phantom
We be doing the thing, girl, hope you don't change, girl
Maybe one day I might get you and my main girl
Tequilla shots, got her taking off her top
Make that ass pop, I'mma drink this bottle to the last drop
I got bands, baby, dance like a mascot
You can hit me up, I done moved from the last spot

Don't tell your baby father shit
He worried about getting lit
Them other women can't outclass you
Celine bag with the tassels
Pretty face and she got some ass too
High heels, pills and potions
Wrists [?] get the dutches, we smoking
I'm a starver for my southside chicks
But please don't run your lips about no side nigga dick

Money too long, it don't matter, but it measures
You ain't in my good look, we just look better
Gotta keep it on the low though, don't tell 'em
He ain't cuffing you like a convicted felon
Said she wanna groove back like stella
No one could do it better, k. I double letter
She beautiful, she bella, homie, don't sweat her, let her
She was like that when you met her
Rg, goodfellas, let's go

(Don't tell 'em)
You don't really care right? Say it like you mean it
Later on you're sneaking, behavior going indecent
No holding back, ain't got no reason
Middle of the summer and I'm out here freezing
Please and all of the above
Girl, don't tell that nigga nothing, play it cool
He accusing you, just say it wasn't another fool
New clues, I leave your nose, dimes need every one of those
Hundred rolls, holding your heart, I play my part
