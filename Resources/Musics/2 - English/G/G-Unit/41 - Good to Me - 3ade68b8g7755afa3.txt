GOOD TO ME

[50 Cent:]
You gotta love it
(You got to be good to me)
Yea you gotta figure out how to make me feel special
(I'm going be good to you)
And I'll be good to you
I'll treat you how you need to be treated
(You got to be good to me)
You got to be all I need you to be baby
(I'm going be good to you)
And I'll make you feel like OHH MY GOD

[50 Cent:]
I'm a 360 nigga, 730 all the way dirty
I got that burner on me now, you heard me
Tasted the good life twice, rap and shooting dice
Hell naw, I ain't put my head between her legs
Smelled like a philly wood grain
Bitch I'm balling, in a Bentley continental see bitch I'm hauling
You got to want to win like I want to win and do things my way
If not I'll put your ass out on the highway
I'm a bad judge of character, I know that shit
Man time don't fly when you fuck with the wrong bitch
I mean damn why you come to me bitch
What you want from me bitch
You're like the boogey man, your haunting me bitch
I give you money, you spend that, and come back
Like you need a new stack
I'm puzzled now, how the fuck you blow that
You got a nigga on the side, well you should have him full time
Go fuck up his shit instead of mine

[50 Cent:]
Go get, punk bitch
(You got to be good to me)
I don't need you round here, no way
A mufuckin headache, you understand what I'm saying
(I'm going be good to you)
Look my motherfucking head hurts right now cause of your punk ass
Bitch, why don't you find something constructive to do
(You got to be good to me)
You know, KILL YOUSELF
G-Go on kill yourself
(I'm going be good to you)
Go on to the bathroom, open the cabinet, and eat the pills

[Lloyd Banks:]
She loves you when your paper thick
It looks like your making it
In and out the town fresh, Audi R8'ing it
Freak fest, south beach, mardi gras taping it
In the club balling on my party hard take and shit
V.I.P.'ing on her, you ain't even got a place to sit
Smoking piff, you'll cough, every time you take a hit
Well mama got me stuck, look how she shake her hip
She ain't used to this shit but I'm a make it fit
She wants a sex drive, she wants a new one
I'll do you one better, I won't cum 'til you cum
A joint account'll turn one bum to two bums
Dealing with a chick that can't even walk and chew gum
Money don't solve the problems, it prolongs it
You don't want things to get better, you just want shit
Ain't nobody happy bout me and you, they all sick
Bitch you had swagger, but mine reinforced it
Everything you had lost it

[50 Cent:]
Man, you should be happy you got rid of that bitch man
(You got to be good to me)
She wasn't even worth the shoes she walked out in
(I'm going be good to you)
I know you want the mufucking shoes back
Them mufuckers were hot man
I ain't going to front
Fin' tell my bitch
(You got to be good to me)
"Man you need to get you a pair of those shoes man, Banks said those things looking good"
(I'm going be good to you)
I'm a real nigga, Tonys that bitch nigga, how much money you got nigga

[Tony Yayo:]
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's super nigga
With 5 acres and a mule and the coupe is bigger
You gone trip on that hoe, you a stupid nigga
I'm a P.I.M.P. not cupid nigga
Hoe pimping all day bitch, this ain't a hobby
My name Tony, not Paul McCartney
I'm in a 7 star suite, Dutchin' my haze
Remote in my hand, model bitch on my mate
Baby girl want Chloe and Fende spars
She wants to fly to L.A. and live like a star
She wants to eat lobster and caviar
But we eat Burger King and we fuck in the car
I'll be far from your friend and your lover
I hit a bitch off, drop her off, and burn rubber
Pull out the rubber, can't get a dime, it's bad enough Uncle Sam trying to take mine
Shiiiiiiitttttttt

[50 Cent:]
Damn nigga, a bitch can't even get a pair of shoes
(You got to be good to me)
Man you ain't going to be able to keep no bitch like that man
(I'm going be good to you)
I'll tell you, I started out the same way
I mean even in the projects
(You got to be good to me)
Bitch didn't pay attention for all that
Know what I'm talking about
(I'm going be good to you)
I started out like that too
Now I buy 'em whatever they want
Haha
