PIANO MAN (FT. YOUNG BUCK)

T.O.S.

I move the keys, they call me the piano man 
I'm classically trained, nobody do it better man 
I do my thang, with me and my Beretta man 
I got that girl, you want her come and get her man 

Hook X4 
Call me the Piano Man 

Tony Yayo 
Cartier glasses, Cartier belt 
Cartier Watch tell me time somewhere else 
Like Germany, Sweden and Serbia 
Nigga one or two birds and I'm servin ya 
I'ma ball like Julius, Erving, Iverson and Manning 
I got that cannon in that two door phantom 
Nigga hundred EX sh*t, suicide doors 
Get a top or low fade, now the body lookin' hard 
This snake ass niggas is reptiles 
'til I shoot em up and fill em up with projectiles 
Yay' got the best style, Yay' got the best clothes 
Yay' got the best weed, Yay' got the best hoes 
Yeah! 

50 Cent (Chorus) 
I move the keys, they call me the piano man 
I'm classically trained, nobody do it better man 
I do my thang, with me and my Beretta man 
I got that girl, you want her come and get her man 

Hook X4 
Call me the Piano Man 

Lloyd Banks 
Yeah 
Fresh out the rimshot, my wheels tick-tock 
My steel six shot, the paint flip flop 
My charm truckie that's why they wanna fu*k me 
207 McLaren, body like Buffy 
Old head get rusty, and I'm a can of oil 
If Hip-Hop do die, a 100 grand'll boil 
Show up at your bougie event, get your body harmed 
Slide you all over the stage like Omarion 
Don't need a party calm, on the pepsi and bacardi bomb

Bail ain't nothin, I make a Gotti bond 
Magician, I can make a dollar flip 
Stick a whole Corona bottle in a model chick 

50 Cent (Chorus) 
I move the keys, they call me the piano man 
I'm classically trained, nobody do it better man 
I do my thang, with me and my Beretta man 
I got that girl, you want her come and get her man 

Hook X4 
Call me the Piano Man 

Young Buck 
I'm richer than a muthafu*ka ridin' in a dirty ass
phantom 
We kill undercovers down here we can't stand em 
Fill up the door panels and stuff the floor boards 
I can fit a hundred in a Honda Accord 
Blood of a drug lord, brain of a baller 
Hand of a hustler, I'm all about a dollar 
Everybody's a customer, Nobody's a friend 
Somebody gotta do it, anybody can win 
If I did it then, I can do it now 
When we get 'em in, we just ship 'em out 
A Gucci briefcase, dressed in a suit & tie 
Cartier's you can tell that I 

50 Cent (Chorus) 
Move the keys, they call me the piano man 
I'm classically trained, nobody do it better man 
I do my thang, with me and my Beretta man 
I got that girl, you want her come and get her man
