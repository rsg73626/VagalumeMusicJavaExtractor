LIKE A DOG

[50 Cent]
It's the Unit

You gotta know how we do it

[Chorus][50 Cent]
I Put the seat back when we rolling,
I Let the system thump when we coasting
I had the tre pound with me cock
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog

Niggas say they know me
I don't know them
They say we came up together
I don't owe them
A motherfucker ding
I'll Make you hot
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog

[Verse][50 Cent]
A nigga try smoke me,
I'm gone smoke him
When I say I'm all in
I mean I'm all in
Nigger you blink shell cases just fall in
You fucking with the police?
Well you better call him
Cause I'm a reload my shit
And come right back
You know different day
Same shift with the same strap
Me I gotta get it
I gotta get my bread
I pin a bitch a freak,
Huh, She got to give me head
I got a reputation,
I stay with the burner
I call it putting work in
The D's call it murder
So half and half with my cold D
We only got one pill,
It's one pistol, one target, one shot, one kill

[Chorus][50 Cent]
I Put the seat back when we rolling,
I Let the system thump when we coasting
I had the tre pound with me cock
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog

Niggas say they know me
I don't know them
They say we came up together
I don't owe them
A motherfucker ding
I'll Make you hot
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog

[Verse][Tony Yayo]
I'm a beast,*boss*, gangster, goon
Grab my knife, my gun, my vest
It's on,
Lay a nigger on his lawn,
Versace style,
Got my 44 alone in my Versace now
Hold my foot kilos
Switch cars trying to b-low
I touch more DR
Then got a line away
I shooting windows, doors and parked cars
80 grand on your head, OH GOD,
Tripod in the arnarge
It's so hard
I can charge it on the gold card or black card
I'm a be in Italy when they pop your noodles
Nigga 7 star shit eating lots of stroodles

[Chorus][50 Cent]
I Put the seat back when we rolling,
I Let the system thump when we coasting
I had the tre pound with me cock
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog

Niggas say they know me
I don't know them
They say we came up together
I don't owe them
A motherfucker ding
I'll Make you hot (nothing)
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog (yeeeah)

[Verse][Lloyd Banks]
Hopping out of something foreign,
Bumping oreen
I'm B, I'm not the one for sparing
I'll gun your car your in
Watch the game at the garden
Next to Martin
Here to spite me barking, he's sleep walking
I'm hollow tilting, Champagne bottles open
Chronic smoking,
Even the models groping
My pockets pocking,
The games sick, I'm the potion,
I be proofing,
And I flow like the ocean,
Machines make movies,
You can be the poster,
Your Over,
I'll tell the media your mediocre,
I push your big body,
Your riding in the mini-vans,
I fuck like will
And smoke like the Indians.

[Chorus][50 Cent]
I Put the seat back when we rolling,
I Let the system thump when we coasting
I had the tre pound with me cock
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog

Niggas say they know me
I don't know them
They say we came up together
I don't owe them
A motherfucker ding
I'll Make you hot
Run up on me get Shot
In the street like a dog
