[Intro]
Ive been so many places
Ive seen so many faces
Girl you look like someone that ive done fucked before
Ive been around the world
Ive meet all kinds of girls
Girl you look like someone I done fucked on tour

[50 Cent (Singing)]
(Now everythings changed) Im rich bitch
(Youve done heard of my name) 50 cent bitch
(Ima p.i.m.p) Ima pimp bitch
(You done heard about me) Coz im the shit bitch

[Tony Yayo]
Sometimes i rhyme slow sometimes i rhyme quick
Thats the reason these groupies is on my dick
Listen young and old these hoes is loose
Wintertimes the staircase summertimes the roof
Gimme 8 days in the 8th hommie im straight

I got birds backstage the serious eye candy
I got birds in the hood so im in to birds with mary
My writing methods got me more hoes than tice and betha
Icy necklace on the tour bus ass naked here staright jump
Bitch say how high and flag down a car when the shit drive by

Fuicking hoes over fifty four my name here weight you barely no
You on that R Kelly shit your bitch is barely grown

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Is shorty aint feelin me shorty must like girls
Coz im only eatin your whirl
Bitch I can make you famous u dont know what your missin
I can change your mind if you listen
If the bitch dont like me the bitch must dont like men (like men)
I say what I want coz I can
If I didnt id be a liar 
Mommy im on fire
Come ride with a rider
The crowd say you might catch the king with a singer
For touching my doorbells the only way ill put a ring on your finger
Give me a convo with two cups an 
Im in your bedroom fucking up your sheets like the ku klux klan
I shook hands wiv my fans and fuck em
Im in the hallways tryin to duck em
So i can climb in to somethin
My names B-A-N-K dollar sign bitch
Im a bigme to make that switch
Now come gimmie that

[Chorus]

(Groupie love I love that shit)

[Outro]
Groupies come and groupies go
And they are allways at our show
So I garb me the tightest one and purseed straight to the mall
Shes so excited thats shes here with me that she feels she should pay here fee
And I did not disagree so she droped down to her knees
