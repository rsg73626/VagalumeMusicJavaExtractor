WORLD OF LIES

Maybe I could change, but why would i want ?
to live like you?
to scream like you? to say "i love you"... and after i cry without you
take my heart in the floor, my poor life, my lie world...
sometimes when i need you...
i am needing of me
sometimes i want you...
but you can't see than i love you more than my life ... than i am dying 
my hate is my god when i am loving you...
i can't to say i love you because you don't say i love too...
only lies ...
only lies in my life 
come to me .. i want  breath on more time... i want to live one more time
i want my lies with you...
i'm sorry when i say than i love you... i know than it is boring but is the truth to me ...
maybe i could change, but why would i want ?
maybe i feel the same than you
but i still don't know
i feel my body together the your 
we make a lies life...
and now i want to lie again 
with you
