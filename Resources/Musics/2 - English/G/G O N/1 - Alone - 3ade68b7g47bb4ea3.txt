ALONE

(g.o.n)
(alone)
she's not my creator
i am g.o.n
i am my creator
i don't see! 
oh in the end i can see my eyes. do you understand?
red eyes of  hate 
blood in my hands
i can see my soul die
my lost love
all life i loved you
i've hate of me because all  life i loved you
i wanted you
i wished you 
now i have blood in my hands 
your blood than covered me stands
life you don't have
and don't go of my head
i don't want but i love you 
my soul is under in the hell
the devil is my fake god now
i have your life and i don't have my life
she's now  with the devil
i don't want but she's  with he
and you  together of me
but i can't stop my heart
it love you 
now i am alone 
alone in the dark and alone in the life
way alone!
i want my god 
and i want you
i still love you
still love you!!!!
i still love you this is the truth
if you don't want me, than shit!!
sucker my soul!!!
