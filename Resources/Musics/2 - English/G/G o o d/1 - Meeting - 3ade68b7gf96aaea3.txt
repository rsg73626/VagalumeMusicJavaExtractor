MEETING

Isn’t it really strange that I met you again? 
I don’t understand why we keep on meeting up at different places 
But whenever I see you I smile 
It’s really strange. It’s something to think about… 

Wait – why do I not hate you? I don’t know you. 
I’m usually not like this – you know that. 
I really don’t know you, right? 
But why do you feel so familiar? 
You’re walking towards me with 
A shy smile on your lips 
You’re coming closer to me 
And you talk to me – why do I not hate you? 
Explain this to me. 

*Why do I keep thinking of you? 
Why is your smile stuck in my head? 
Whenever I think of you I’m smiling 
I think I want to see you again. 

I keep on thinking about today. 
It’s not even important – why do I remember? 
But I can’t even forget yoru expression. 
It’s really strange. It’s something to think about. 

When I first saw you I just passed it off 
I didn’t know I’d see you in my dreams 
But how did I remember your face? 
It’s really weird – how do these things happen? 
You’re not even my type 
Your face isn’t pretty 
And your body isn’t all that great, either 
But why am I like this? I’m acting strangely. 

*Repeat 

Girl it's so true never felt this way till I met you 
I think of you even when I turn off the lights and try to sleep 

*Repeat
