GLOW

Wendy Page :

Your eyes are saucer wide
Staring at the sky
What you looking for
Don’t waste my time
How can you find your voice
When you let the cat get your tongue
Don’t you know when the night comes
I can glow
The things I know
Brighter than the moonlight
You can shine your light for two
All these feelings in my heart for you
Glow
Yeah yeah ho ho
I landed somewhere in the future
Behind the door
I found I can love
I wasn’t even looking for
I broke into a sweat
Asking if you’re there yet
Let’s colonise this place
And fix the human race
Before it gets too late
Don’t you know when the night comes
You can glow
The things you know
You bring light gifts into my home
Shine brighter than starlight
Oh your light for two
Feeling in my heart for two
You will find me blindfold
I can glow
Yeah yeah
These things I know
I can glow
I know the power of darkness
Light is the night
Knowledge is the key
To all we do and see
Peace and serenity
Are the flowers of our acceptance
Yeah
These things I know
You can glow
These things you know
Shine brighter than the moonlight
Shine your light for two
All these feelings in my heart for you
Glow
Your gifts you bring into my heart
My heart
These things I know
