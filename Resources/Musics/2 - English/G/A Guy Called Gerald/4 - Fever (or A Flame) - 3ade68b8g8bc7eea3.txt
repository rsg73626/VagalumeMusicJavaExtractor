FEVER (OR A FLAME)

Wendy Page :

Comes this feeling from a distance
Like a fever or a flame
Takes me over
Let it just fly
This star has wings and now so have I
Close my eyes ready for sleep
Let it rise up from the deep
Your name I remember
Your name I remember
Like a fever or a flame
Just like a fever or a flame

And you are gone
But not forgotten
In the distance but not forgiven
This human heart still feels the same
But you consume it
Just like a fever or a flame

Your name I remember
Your name I remember
Like a fever or a flame
Just like a fever or a flame
And my pillow you are again
In my dreams still you talk
The mystery of you
And what you used to do
Still remain
Just like a fever or a flame
Just like a fever or a flame

Close my eyes Iâ€™m ready for sleep
Let it rise up from the deepest deep
Your name I remember
Your name I remember
Like a fever or a flame
Just like a fever or a flame

Your name I remember
Your name I remember
Like a fever or a flame
Just like a fever or a flame
I know I wish you home again
I know I wish you home again

Comes this feeling from a distance
Like a fever or a flame
It takes me over let it just fly
This star has wings and now so have I
Your name I remember
Your name I remember
Like a fever or a flame
