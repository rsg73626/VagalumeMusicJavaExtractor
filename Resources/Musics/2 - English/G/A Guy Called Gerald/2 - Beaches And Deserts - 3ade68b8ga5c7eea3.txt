BEACHES AND DESERTS

Beaches and deserts where you take me
Beaches and deserts where you take me
From low to high
From wet to dry
Beaches and deserts where you break me
Beaches and deserts where you break me
From safe to sound
From lost to found
And I love these extremes of you
Don’t wake up without dreams of you
Here on the edge of you
Is where I will live

Beaches and deserts where you leave me
Beaches and deserts where you leave me
Beaches and deserts where you grieve me
From good to bad
From happy to sad
And I love these extremes of you
Don’t wake up without dreams of you
Here on the edge of you
Is where I will live
Here on the edge of you
Is where I will live forever
I will live forever
Here on the edge of you
Is where I will live forever
I will live forever
I will live forever
