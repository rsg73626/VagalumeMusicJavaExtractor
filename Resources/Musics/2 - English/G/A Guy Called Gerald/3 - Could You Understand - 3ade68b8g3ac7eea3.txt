COULD YOU UNDERSTAND

David Simpson :

Rythm…
Say if tell you a story from my hood
Could you ever
Could you understand
Could you ever now
Could you understand
Say if I tell you a story from my hood
Could you ever
Could you would you understand
Could you ever understand
Say it’s all about coming up
Cutting through but coming up
Say it’s all about coming up
Say it’s all about coming up
Listen eh hot in the daytime
Cold cash at the night-time
Listen hot stuff in the daytime
Cold cash money at the night-time
You know we make it right y all
Couple of zeros behind the one
Not for fun straight get the job done
Could you understand
Could you ever understand
My hood
Cos this is my hood
Could you ever
Would you ever know
Could you understand
Nowadays
Could you represent
Could you represent
Could you represent
Could you represent

Could you understand
Nowadays
Could you ever
Would you understand
