HURRY TO GO EASY

Something's going on with blaze
She can shake the sky
Flying saucers in her eyes
Senses wide awaking
Out the freaking side
All day long yeah
She hurries to go easy

She feels
What's real
All day long yeah
She hurries to go easy

Something's really happening
Smoking sassafrass
Grass is on her arse
Wearing out her slippers
Magic mushroom jazz
All day long yeah
She hurries to go easy

She feels
What's real
All the day all the day all the day
All day long yeah
Hurry to go easy
