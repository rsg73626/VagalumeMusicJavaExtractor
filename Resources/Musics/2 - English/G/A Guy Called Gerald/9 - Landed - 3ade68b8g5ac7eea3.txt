LANDED

Hello hello brave new world
It feels so good to be here
The earth looks very beautiful
Spinning in her atmosphere

I've cut the lifeline and I don't mind
I've cut the lifeline and I feel fine

I've landed I've landed
Nothing broken or bruised
Nothing left I can't lose
This time everything's fine
Yeah

The earth looks very delicate
A blue green jewel in a star crust bowl of inky black
Until my planet wants me back
I've cut the lifeline and I don't mind
I've cut the lifeline for good this time
I've landed I've landed

Nothing broken or bruised
Nothing left I can't lose
This time everything's fine
I've landed I've landed

Don't my people want me back
They'll turn on when I have my crash
Make my splash
Another nine day wonder to fill the news
By then I'll be long gone by then I'll be long gone
I've landed I've landed
Nothing broken or bruised

Nothing left I can lose
This time everything's fine
I've landed I've landed
I've landed I've landed

Hello hello hello hello brave new world
I've cut the lifeline I've cut the lifeline
And I don't mind
I've landed I've landed
Oh I've landde for good this time
