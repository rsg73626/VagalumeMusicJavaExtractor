SCALE CIRCLE

Wendy Page :

You look at me but what do you see
Who I am or who you'll have me be
I don’t know what else I can give
Sometimes live and let live

Down the corridor
You leave me wanting more
Looking back I’m on my knees
You never tease you just release
And with these chains you set me free
And with these chains you set me free

Everything about me multiplies
The stars and the shadows in your eyes
Ask you if you’ll love me one more time
You say I do love you love you

I tell myself I'll leave when I choose
I ask myself I have a good snooze
These questions never go away
They burn like an eternal flame

Down the corridor said you wanted more
Looking back I'm on my knees
You never tease you just release
With these chains you set me free
And with these chains you set me free

Everything about me multiplies
The stars and the shadows in your eyes
Ask you if you’ll love me one more time
You say I do love you love you

And with these chains you set me free
With these chains you set me free

And down the corridor
