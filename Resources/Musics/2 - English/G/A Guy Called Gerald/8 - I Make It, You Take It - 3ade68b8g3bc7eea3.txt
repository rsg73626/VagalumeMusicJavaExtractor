I MAKE IT, YOU TAKE IT

David Simpson:

Oh Oh
You owe it to yourself
Yeah
Where do I belong
Why do I sing this song
I'm feeling like a slave
Oh to the rhythm
I make it you take you fake it
You break it
Yeah
Got to know I'm...
Yeah
Got to know when to
Yeah you know that
Yes you know that
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Need a place where I can call my own
Where do I belong
Need a place where I can stand alone
Where do I belong
Where do I belong
Need a place where I can call my own
Why do I sing this song
Feeling like a slave to the rhythm
Land of hope and glory
Listen to my story
I make it you take you fake it
You break it
Got to know my place
Got to know my place
Need a place that I can call my own
Need a place where I can stand alone
Got to know my place
Got to know where to move
Where to run where to hide
Leave us all alone yeah
Leave us all alone
Need a place where i can call my own
Leave us all alone
Need a place where i can stand alone
Leave us all alone
