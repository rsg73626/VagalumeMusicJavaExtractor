WE'RE FROM THE FUTURE

They told us we were girls
So we claimed our female lives
Now they tell us we aren't girls
Our femininity doesn't fit
We're fucking future girls living outside society's shit!

We're from the future
Not from the past
We live our own way not up history's ass
Won't reenact won't perform their hardcore
The straight-boy cannon is a royal bore

The future
Faggots and femmes!
The future
Not just any outcasts
Girls living outside society's shit!

What's the point in sucking them off
Trendy mutant skinheads can jerk themselves off
We don't need validation from them
They think they're the shit but they can't handle hard femmes

The future
Faggots and femmes
The future
Not just any outcasts
