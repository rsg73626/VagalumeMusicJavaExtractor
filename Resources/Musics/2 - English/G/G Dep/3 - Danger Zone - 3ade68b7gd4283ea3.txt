DANGER ZONE

[background ad libs by P. Diddy]
(Danger)
(Danger)
(Ah ah ah)
(Danger)

Today is the day we ride, you's a made your whole fucking family by
This is how we ride, see me, smoking that seaweed
Y'all gonna see me today
Fuck that, when we come through just crowd
Crowd up around y'all listen to the sound
Yo, this is for the way we rock
Thinkin' Bad Boy gonna stop, we not
Yo, we step up in the scene like oh!
You hear their flow and then there they go
In the Range Ro' see the ringers go blind
There the brain go every single time
Put it in perspective, reflection in step
Step to the left while I rep it to the death
Easily approached, smokin' on the roach in coach
til I'm so high I'm on another plane
Hey, every fucking spot we go, we just rock you see now we know
Fuckin' news cameras they want to get the footage
Wanna grind out find out where my hood is
Let's just say that this is how we put it, down
Y'all niggas cool out and lounge
Fuck around, radios down this
Say we go round this bullshit straight to the plate
Now, every fucking spot we go
Gust when you thought we would stop, we go
Came a long way from them nice hallways
What you talk about we could do it all day, what you say now

[Hook 1]
Now this jam here be the Danger Zone (danger)
Everywhere I go got a Danger Zone (danger)
Niggas can't roam to the Danger Zone (danger)
You won't come home from the Danger Zone (danger)
You gotta have chrome in the Danger Zone (danger)
Cause you all alone in the Danger Zone (danger)
Can't call home from the Danger Zone (danger)
Lounge homeboy, you in the Danger Zone (danger)

If you don't know you better (ah ah ah)
Get your coverage, got no money for the show then dub it
Make moves forward, get on with the green
Get the white out, I'm a blow wit ya team
Put it up in smoke, when the album wrote
Cadillac on spokes and it ain't a fuckin' joke
Ain't no laughin', straight up mashing
Catch me in a brand new ate up Madison
Magazine ads and G-Dep has it
Bad Boy classic, that boy acid
That's it, blowing up your audio
Stacking is all we know, catch you before we go world
Yeah, This is just the way we roll
Got a bank roll, I'm a get it on swoll
Fuck the parole, catch me in Cancun
Niggas wanna know when my joint go boom, soon

[Hook 2]
Now this jam here be the Danger Zone (danger)
Everywhere I go got a Danger Zone (danger)
Niggas can't roam to the Danger Zone (danger)
You won't come home from the Danger Zone (danger)
You gotta have chrome in the Danger Zone (danger)
Can't call home from the Danger Zone (danger)
'cause ain't no phones in the Danger Zone (danger)
Lounge homeboy, you in the Danger Zone (danger)

Fully loaded full pound (ah ah ah) is a dangerous sound
Got me aimin' to pound on dangerous ground
My aim gear is sound, type like wind is
to changin' the cloud and it rains on the crowd
You blazin' this loud, you raisin' your brow in amazement
Astounded, your plane been grounded
Name been clowned and your brain been found in
the Asian brown bin with flies around it
Look what the pound did, not like the brown kid
Then look around 'cause you're quite surrounded
Fight the rounds but can't find the rounds
that might swipe you down, it looks like you're down, kid
Spoon fed in the hospital bed when I popped you
Ain't shit the doctor you dead
Start listening to gospel instead
Cops still the head so I'm hostile in Fed, so

[Hook 3]
Lounge homeboy, you in the Danger Zone (danger)
Niggas don't roam to the Danger Zone (danger)
Everywhere I go is a Danger Zone (danger)
You won't come home from the Danger Zone (danger)
You gotta have chrome in the Danger Zone (danger)
Cause you all alone in the Danger Zone (danger)
Can't call home from the Danger Zone (danger)
Cause ain't no phones in the Danger Zone (danger)

[Hook 4]
Now everybody know about the Danger Zone (danger)
Little mutherfuckers and their age is grown (danger)
Lotta niggas had to get their fame you blown (danger)
Just to get known in the Danger Zone (danger)
You gotta know the codes in the Danger Zone (danger)
Shit might explode in the Danger Zone (danger)
Niggas unload in the Danger Zone (danger)
You gotta blaze your chrome or change is on (danger)

(ahh ahh ahh)
