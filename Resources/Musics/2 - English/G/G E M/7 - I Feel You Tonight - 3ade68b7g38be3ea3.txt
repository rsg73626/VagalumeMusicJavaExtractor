I FEEL YOU TONIGHT

Cause I feel you tonight 
Cause I feel you tonight 
Cause I feel you, feel you 
Tonight I feel you 
Cause I feel you tonight 
Cause I feel you tonight 
Cause I feel you, feel you 
Tonight 
Cause I feel you tonight 
I feel you baby 
I feel you, I feel you baby 

You don't want me 
You don't want me 
You don't need me in your life 
I feel you baby 

Baby you don't know what I feel for you 
Maybe because I didn't know until tonight 
In my heart I feel I need you so 
Please forgive me if I never show you my love 

Baby you don't know what I feel inside 
Sure you didn't know it would be tonight 
I give you all my loving and you know for sure 
Please forgive me if I never show you my love
