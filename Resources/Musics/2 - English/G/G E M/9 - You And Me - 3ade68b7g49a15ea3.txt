YOU AND ME

I want to live want to live my life now 
Don't you tell me just what you do 
Boy it is over another day now 
But my bedrocks adore 

Watch what you do boy you're living in danger 
I don't want you with me by my side 
I cannot stand you right now any longer 
I am not playing this time 

You and me just tell me what you wanna do 
Uh oh uh oh it's only you and I 
You and me now tell me what you wanna do 
Uh oh uh oh it's only you and I 

Uh oh uh oh tell me what you want to do 
Uh oh uh oh tell me what you want to do 
Uh oh uh oh tell me what you want to do 
It's you and me tell me what you want to do 

As I'm walking right down the streets what 
I see a person that's not for me 
Bring me the silence I cannot walk what 
I am alone but I am free 

Watch what you do boy you're living in danger 
I don't want you with me by my side 
I cannot stand you right now any longer 
I am not playing this time 

Uh oh uh oh tell me what you want to do 
Uh oh uh oh tell me what you want to do 
Uh oh uh oh tell me what you want to do 
It's you and me tell me what you want to do 

uh oh uh oh...
