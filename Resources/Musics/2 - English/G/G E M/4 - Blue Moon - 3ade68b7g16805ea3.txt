BLUE MOON

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own
 
Blue moon
You know just what I was there for 
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really do care for 
And then suddenly appeared before me

The only one my arms could ever hold 
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
But when I looked that moon had turned to gold


Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone 
Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own 

Blue moon
