GOOD TO KNOW YOU

can`t escape your frowning 
rearching out for a helping hand 
is there something that I could say 
there are things that we can`t explain 

wanna be myself 
wanna lose myself 
gotta save myself of you 

one day I`ll be around 
someday without a doubt 
you say I`m fabulous 
oh so fabulous 
one day I don`t know how 
maybe I'll work it out 
I know you're fabulous 
so good to know you 

see you got that certain look 
reading me like an open book 
oh yeah it`s eating me 
all I ever want is to be free 

wanna be myself 
wanna lose myself 
gotta save myself from you 

one day I`ll be around 
someday without a doubt 
you say I`m fabulous 
oh sow fabulous 
one day I don`t know how 
maybe I'll work it out 
I know you're fabulous 
so good to know you 

one day I`ll be around 
someday without a doubt 
you say I`m fabulous 
oh so fabulous 
one day I don`t know how 
maybe I'll work it out 
I know you're fabulous 
so good to know 
so good to know 
so good to know you
