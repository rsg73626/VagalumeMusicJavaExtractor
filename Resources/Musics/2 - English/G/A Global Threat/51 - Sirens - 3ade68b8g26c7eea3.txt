SIRENS

I hear an echo ringing through the corridor
somewhere a fire burns while rain begins to pour
did somebody slip up, did someone hit the floor?
they say it's too late now
I hear them calling out
it's just sirens
you pass yourself as you're walking down the street
it's in all our heads, it's better you than me
so pinch your pennies 'cause life is far from free
they say it's too late now
I hear them calling out
it's just sirens
