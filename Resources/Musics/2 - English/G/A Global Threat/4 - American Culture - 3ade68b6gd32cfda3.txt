AMERICAN CULTURE

we're gonna fight it till the end and we won't be beat
down again
your culture's fed into our veins, your preaching
tyranny and hate
to follow in your footsteps would be hypocracy
so now's the time to fight for our beliefs
are we the only ones here who won't judge your
sexuality?
are we the only ones here who want equality?
are we the only ones here who won't judge you by your
skin?
are we the only ones here who know together we can
win?
