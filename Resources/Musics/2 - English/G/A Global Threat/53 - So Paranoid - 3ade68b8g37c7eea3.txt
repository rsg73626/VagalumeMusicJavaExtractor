SO PARANOID

hearing sounds at your front door
do they think you don't watch out anymore?
will they come and take what's yours?
all the houses look the same
and do they even know your name?
or these sounds just an a.m. train
you get so paranoid, I get so paranoid
we get so paranoid, 'cause we're stuck
inside this fucking void
it's society and we can't avoid it
don't tell me you can
so go ahead and say you don't trust me
'cause i'm not apart of your polity
and I don't care what you think of me
still in this city we all seem insane
and I don't think I wanna know your name
'cause when they come for us
we'll all be the SAME
