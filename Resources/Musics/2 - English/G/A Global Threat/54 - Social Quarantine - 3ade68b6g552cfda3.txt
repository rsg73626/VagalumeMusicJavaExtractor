SOCIAL QUARANTINE

Pacing room to room inside
It seems that you can't face the pace of daily life
Thinking out loud with no crowd to mind
Four walls are all in which confide
Peoples pressure, a mental tether
A police lock pole on the wrong side of your door
It's a social quarantine
Retrace the stepds leading you out side
keep running but theres just no place to hide
Feeling too uptight to unwind
Dread todays few moments of daylight
It's the pressure that you wont measure
Stuck in here alone for fear of whats in store 
it's a social quarnatine.
