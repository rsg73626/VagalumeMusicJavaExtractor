BEST DAYS

Verse One
The River Was Deep, the Water Was Cold,
I Was Only Twelve Years Old.
My Dad and Me, Trout Fishing,
Waist Deep in a Michigan Stream. 

He Showed Me How to Make That Fly,
Look Like It Was So Alive.
And Then He Helped Me Understand,
How to Be a Fisher of Men. 

Chorus
And All the World Was Right,
And I Felt So Full and Alive
In the Wonder and the Light,
And I Would Never Be the Same,
For I Knew Somehow I Had Changed.
Even Now I'd Have to Say,
It Was One of My Best Days. 

Verse Two
It Was Like a Rock, a Lump in My Throat,
I Was Eighteen Years Old,
But I Had to Say Something
To the Prettiest Girl I'd Ever Seen. 

A New World Record Was Set That Day,
For the Stupid Things I'd Say.
I Made Her Laugh, It Must've Been Enough,
For By Day's End We'd Fall in Love. 

Chorus
And All the World Was Right,
And I Felt So Full and Alive
In the Wonder and the Light,
And I Would Never Be the Same,
For I Knew Somehow I Had Changed.
Even Now I'd Have to Say,
It Was One of My Best Days. 

Verse Three
Sometimes I Look to the Eastern Sky,
Wondering What It Will Be Like,
When We All Finally Learn,
Of the Day You Return. 

What Will I Feel?
Where Will I Be?
Will It All Seem Like a Dream?
I Think It'll Be Like a Long-lost Friend,
Coming Back to His Family Again. 

Chorus
And All the World Will Be Right,
And We'll Feel So Full and Alive
In His Wonder and His Light,
And We Will Never Be the Same,
For I Know We All Will Be Changed,
And We Will Surely Say,
This Is the Very Best of Days,
This Is the Very Best,
The Very Best of Days.
