ELITIST ATTITUDES

you put quarters in the juke box to complain about the songs
you used to be supportive now you're telling us we're wrong
but nothing's really changed, we're still a bunch of kids
still singing nothing fucking different than we ever did
still playing for the kids
but why should i be justifying what we try to do
to somebody who sits around talking shit like you
you try to so hard to segregate
the kids who still participate in what you claim to be part of
you eliminate it
divide and seal our fate
elite few
who needs you?
elite few
the maine punx are everywhere, in every fucking state
it's all the kids who refuse to live how their fucking peers dictate
it's all the kids out getting shit for how they look and how they think
that's why we'r all still singing it, and anyone can join in
you missed the fucking point
