THE KIDS WILL REVOLT

police cars are after you, your parents tell you what to do
if what they say is all so true, i guess there's no home left for you
kids will revolt... against all authority
teachers tell you what to think in you life there's no time to blink
there's no tomorrow without a choice, it's time you used your fucking voice
