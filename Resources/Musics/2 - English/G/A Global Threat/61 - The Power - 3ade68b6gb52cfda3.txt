THE POWER

what makes you more important than me? a uniform is all that i can see they gave you a gun, you're not just a citizen but you've killed before and you'll do it again we watched the power go to your head never should have let it, we're as good as dead i'm not afraid of you what makes you want to fight for them? you're totally blind to the cause of the problem innocent people are scapegoats for the state when you're the root of the shit they say we create
