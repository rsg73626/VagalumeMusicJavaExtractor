SET UP

Extra sheets cause oil isn't cheap
But 2 bucks is 6 cans down on Douglas street
OT got docked this week and somehow more snow
No license, no registration, and nowhere to go

Brain is bouncing off walls
It's just a setback, not a downfall

Take me to the back room where nostrums zoom
Right down the throttle
Set the snare
Out across the sprawl on no sleep
Thrown around like a ragdoll
Can't compete
If down inside something's off, at least I tried
I just can't seem to keep peace
But that's how it goes

Brains are bouncing off of all walls
It's just a setback, not our downfall

We're running out of room inside the scene
Just apply the staples

Set up again
Without a chance
