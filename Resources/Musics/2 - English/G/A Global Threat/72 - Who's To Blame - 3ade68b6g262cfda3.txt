WHO'S TO BLAME

what makes a killer? now that's a bore
what makes you scream? you're being ignored
if your hand are bloody then so are mine
we all want freedom when we're confined
who's to blame?
who's to blame?
what's the fucking difference does it matter who's to blame?
scrutinized or trivialized the end result's the same
the world is going down the fucking drain
these things happen every day
buildings burn, kids are blown away
you think we're safe here (america) privileged from birth?
we're our own victims on planet earth
down the fucking drain
