THERE'S YOUR THREAT

knock down our cemetery plot
we must have gave what we got
guess NYSE and them just weren't that
but the butcher cut the wrong fat
better shop and save up cures
deadbolt all the doors, there's your threat
maximum told us to shove it
six o'clock anchors said they were right
'till time ran out for their kind
now it seems anyone on the fence before
skipped a thousand paces to knock on
a far side's door
is that why i'm face down in bed
TV in a fuzz
don't you wish it would go back to like it was?
is that selfish of us?
better shop and save up cures
deadbolt all the doors
