EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL

Everything is wonderful when you see light beyond the wool
Don't ask who responsible or feel for an alarm to pull
And in this house, shit's going south

It's feeding mouths and breeding more

Bought in, layed off,
But still no doubt it's as good as it gets
Cause the sun never sets on the west
For us to err's impossible
And it's tough to care when comfortable

Go GI, defend our right to profit from the plight of the world
Chase the smell of the oil well
We need someone to do our dirty jobs
But the eagle smelled before it fell on ou heads

And it left a mess
We should give it a rest
