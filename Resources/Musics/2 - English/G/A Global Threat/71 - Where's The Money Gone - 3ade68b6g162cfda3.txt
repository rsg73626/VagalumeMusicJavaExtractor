WHERE'S THE MONEY GONE

you will work your life away for them
but still don't understand the system
you slave, you sell, repeat, they're rich
the money's spent in corporate america's best interest
where's the money gone
not to the people on the street
where's the money gone
but to fight the enemy
where's the money gone
not to the future of the youth
where's the money gone and what's the truth
the bullshit working class pride
with the power on the state's and not the people's side
invest in humanity suicide
plead apathy and let it slide
