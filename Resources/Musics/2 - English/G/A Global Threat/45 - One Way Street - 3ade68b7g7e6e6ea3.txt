ONE WAY STREET

Fresh out of patience, kick the kids to the floor
Out of borrowed pills
Storm out to borrow some more
Though it's nothing nice gonna need a few bucks
Bitch I won't tell you twice

Get kicked to the curb in those shoes
Take a turn for the worse right through
Gotta get what you want

And it's easy to find when you're looking down a one way street
Take to the strip with a chipped shoulder tonight
Lurking with losers like a deer that been caught in the lights
Do or don't
Could use the brain in that thick skull
But probably won't
