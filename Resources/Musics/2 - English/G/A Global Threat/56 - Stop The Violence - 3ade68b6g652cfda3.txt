STOP THE VIOLENCE

red light, blue light, someone's gonna die tonight
there's a tension in the air, seeing people everywhere
suddenly you're surrounded by the ones that you avoid
look for help there's no one around,
don't want to be destroyed
violent kids, death, rape, now there's no escape
society creates a trap and now there is no going back
roaming groups in tens or twelves
no one's thinking for themselves
you can't ignore the violent state,
can't ignore the fuckin hate
stop the violence
some say some day all this shit will go away
do away with the police,
the world will live in harmony
if you ask me that's fuckin shit,
we'll always have to live with it
but you can't give up all hope,
got to find the courage just to cope
stop the violence
