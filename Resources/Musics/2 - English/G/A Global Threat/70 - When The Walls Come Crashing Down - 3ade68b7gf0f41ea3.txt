WHEN THE WALLS COME CRASHING DOWN

there's a veteran who's rotting on the side of the street
he came home from war and couldn't make ends meet
crashing down
your life's wasted away as you fall down to the ground
walls come crashing down
your life's wasted away as you fall down to the ground
crash down
