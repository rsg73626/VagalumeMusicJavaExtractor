BLOODY, RED EYES

punching out and closing up
lets run amok the eve
pour some cups but they won't shut up
so theres piss in their listerine
and now weve gotta leave
punching out and closing up
we'll all meet at the park
boom-box blast and shattered glass
sound out in the dark
then someone's gotta start
punching out and closing up
we'll hang out just for a few
bored or boring no one's out
there's nothing else to do
and everything's old news
hit the sheets, hate the spins
tomorrow i'll wake up again
today was such a sight
for bloody red eyes
