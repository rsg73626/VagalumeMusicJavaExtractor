CUT-UPS

Kicking and screaming
Their don'ts to a teacher that cares
Who follows suit and soon points them to a room
Where parents and doctors await with a solution to share

Kid are just cut-ups
Cutting their cures on a plate

And don't say this song is on point
Or the neighbors that care
Will quickly concede to the neighbors across the street
The problem child lives over there
Everywhere

Your kids are just cut-ups
Cutting their cures on a plate

Are you chasing a feeling or is it getting you by?
Don't say there's no way I'll steal what you're dealing
You're getting us high

The antidote is stuffed inside my coat but it's not curing me
Candy handouts at parties by recommended prescription
The antidote is burning up my throat,
But it's not curing me
