THE PROLES

today i quit my job
its time to have some fuckin' fun
cause work is the worst and i come first
you know i'm not the only one
my life is my own so keep your money
i've got friends so i don't need it
fuck your fucking corporate world
it won't dictate how i lead it
we're the proles, we're everywhere
we're the proles, now we don't care
fuck you jobs, and fuck your pay
they're not worth it anyway
everyday you look down on us
treat us like a piece of shit
but who will dig your fuckn ditch
when all the proles have fuckin quit?
time to think your business over
don't ever look the working class
if you treat us all like whores
there's no way that you can last
