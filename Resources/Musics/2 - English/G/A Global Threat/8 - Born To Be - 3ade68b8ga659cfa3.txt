BORN TO BE

(Chorus)
Hey now people come along with me,
Take a little ride down through history.
Turn through some pages and you might see,
Who it is that you were born to me. 

They said that he could never be the one,
After all he was known as the family runt.
But when that stone hit the head of big g,
Little old dave became the b.m.o.c. 

(Chorus)
Hey now people come along with me,
Let's take a little ride down through history.
Turn through some pages and you might see,
Who it is that you were born to be. 

He knew there had to be another one,
God would never use someone who stuttered on.
But moses met up with a burning bush,
It was back to the bulrushes of his birth. 

(Chorus)
Hey now people come along with me,
Take a little ride down through history.
Turn through some pages and you might see,
Who it is that you were born to me. 

Hey now people get ready let's go.
Take a little ride down destiny's road.
Look in the pages and we will see,
Who it is that we were born to be. 

(Bridge)
The god that worked in them is alive and well in us.
It all comes down to a matter of trust. 

You don't know what you got till you let it all go.
Don't know what you got till you let it all go.
Open up the word and you might see,
Just who it is that you were born to be. 

(Chorus)
Hey now people come along with me,
Let's take a little ride down through history.
Turn through some pages and you might see,
Who it is that you were born to me. 

Hey now people get ready let's go.
Take a little ride down destiny's road.
Look in the pages and we will see,
Who it is that we were born to be.
