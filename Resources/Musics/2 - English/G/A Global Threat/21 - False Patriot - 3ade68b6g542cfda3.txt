FALSE PATRIOT

you say you believe in peace and freedom
but you'll never be free without a fight
you say you believe in the government
when all they do is take away our rights
you've gotta fight for you beliefs
we need to stand together to win this war
you say you believe in the justice system
but who is to say what is just or fair?
you say you believe in the constitution
when equal rights don't apply everywhere
and i don't want to hear, i'm fucking lucky i live
here
cause half you people don't give a shit, about what's
right or wrong
so why should we care, if you don't think we belong?
you say you believe in peace and freedom
but you'll never be free without a fight
you say you believe in the government
when all they do is take away your rights
you say you believe in the justice system.
but who is to say what is just and fair?
you say you believe this country protects you
but the people of the country they don't fuckn' care
