MIND BOMB

You'll listen if I shout
Who cares what it's about?
Another thing that I don't need
Your bible's my record sleeve
I'm in your ear, then out your mouth
Mind bomb, the next is you
Rolls off your tongue, an easy out
Mind bomb, the next is you
On a site to check the scene
Is what you say still what you mean?
Selling cream for teenage jean
They're all still IDLE THREATS
Cause if a brick's been thrown
I haven't seen
It's in your head and out your mouth
Mind bomb, the next is you
Rolls off your tongue, but what are you about?
Mind bomb, the next is you.
Flags wave above a stagnant dream
There's ugly faces and patched fatigues
Don't mess around, We've got it,
nothing left to explore
Do you feel the same thing now that you did before?
Did it already get you?
