LIVE FOR NOW

i see you everday on your way home from work your feeling run down in your slacks and company shirt rotting in a cubical thats 5x4 i can't stand this fucking job anymore a mindless puppet staring at the screen so all this is the american dream a ten hour day and a six day week you've got no life, you let them control you fuck the future live for now who can you say there will be a tomorrow with forty years gone what do you have left? you lost all respect through corporate theft you lent them your mind and they sold your soul your life is a waste now, you're just another prole it's never too late so just remember you're not a person to them, your just a number you don't need the boss, the boss needs you tell him to fuck off your time is through
