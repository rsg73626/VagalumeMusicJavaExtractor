SMOKE UP YOUR ASS

I'm kissing your million dollar grin
You're knocking and I'm gonna let you in
I'm basking in charisma when your gesture commands
I'm shaking your over-shaken hand

So when will the faces of the people we all see
Above the headlines resemble somebody like me?
His collar's whiter than his skin like predesecors past
He got no check on the ballot I cast

Debating on nothing good for us
It's over, who needs your fuckin' trust
I'm asking for charisma and I see you're like the rest
Telling me to fuck off; who'd ever guess?

Here's smoke up your ass
