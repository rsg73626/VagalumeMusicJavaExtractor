YOUNG AND DEAD

At the shows and on the street
Some punks just wont accept you think differently
The way you live it was the wrong way to be
Vegetarian or not, drug free or drunk
There's always someone who says youre not a punk
They're always somebody who tells you that youre wrong
We bitch about what we see on the daily news
But we cant accept each others views
Bow what will we do at the end of our fuse

And now we're young and dead

Instead of respecting our differences in thought
We waste time arguing about whats right and what is not
And some revert to all the violence they've been taught
Opinions vary on what is Punk and what it does
But its not anything until we've earned each others trust
And if it ever happens it is by the fault of all of us
There's two options out there for the youth
Just two options and we've got to choose
United we win, divided we lose

And now we're young and dead

Think about your views
The lifestyle that you choose
And find out what it means to you

Some have had a negative outlook on it from the start
How can you ignore when somethings comming from the heart
If nothing can unite us and nothing's worth a chance
Then why are we all singing what theyre telling us we can't

You've buried any bridge we've come across
And you're the reason for the battles we've lost
When you fight your war just dont forget the cost

And now we're young and dead

Think about your views
The lifestyle that you choose
And find out what it means to you
