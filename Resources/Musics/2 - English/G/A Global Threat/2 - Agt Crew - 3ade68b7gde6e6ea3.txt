AGT CREW

With labels lapping up the catchy spunk
Consumers surfing on a sea of punks
There's a long list of offenders yet to see a judge
And I don't wanna be another suspect

Watch your head
Cap that crop
Punk is dead
Scalped by pop

I can't compute who I should mute or trust
In a faulty forum where spineless minds corrupt
A smile, a product sold with no rewind
It's the perfect kid for the braindead shits

You're missed, what a shock
A to Zed in all the shops
Punk is dead and scalped by pop
