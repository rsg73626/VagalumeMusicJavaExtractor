OUT IN THE DARK

Seems like so many nights
Get the 66 while dusk kills the light
Go ahead and swill two in the back
Looking down on a Cadillac
Catch the headliners first note
Have a drink on someone you know
Stroke of midnight your friends turn a blur
Life seems like shit,
all you think of is her and...

I'm all out in the dark

The corner clock on the walk strikes four
It's quarter of five when
I fall through the door

I'm all out in the dark

Anything you want, or anything you need
So go and sniff your way around
Cause it's getting hard to see
The smoke will never clear
And once you're here you'll never leave
And that pounding, spinning, twitching
You should watch what you eat!

Looks like a blue sky tonight
To twenty eyes it's a familiar sight
Crawl in the sack at sunrise on the mark
Now I want blood cause when I wake
Again it starts
