IN THE RED

We've been good, but I know we can do better
Exactly what's expected right down to the fucking letter
If nothing's changed then where's my brain
If there's no reaction, we're bored again
Time to turn the volume up
More than before for those corrupt

In the red
Just look at your alternatives

We're not some fucking group for hire
And we wouldn't sing flat if we were really a choir
What's to gain by what we're playing?
Unless it's watered down it's not accepted by the mainstream
Loud and fast

Got no money
Couldn't care less
Play it louder

I don't like the fuckin' scene
You say it's part machine
He thinks it's too nice or too clean
They just want to be the stars
Make money with guitars
Why would they accept anything less?
We don't try to relate
With the consumer's taste
I couldn't think straight
If we were Green Day
So we'll play loud instead
Till the meter's in the red
We'll lose our fuckin' heads
'Cause this is not dead
