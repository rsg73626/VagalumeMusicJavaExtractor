SUCKS TO THE POLITICAL

If punk's not a religion then you don't have a savior's word
And it's not, so I never will subscribe to your thoughts
'Cause you've got nothing to say that I haven't heard

Gospel talk and the holy word
Save the world my back is turned

And I don't see the point to life as some kind of martyr
'Cause you're always pushing your solutions on me
But there's always someone pushing harder

You're always right, to live is sin
In a perfect world I guess we'd all repent
