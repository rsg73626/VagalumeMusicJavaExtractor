IDLE THREATS

someone said to me, "look what you did now."
half a dozen squad cars are breaking up the crowd
and if they stop the show we can't chant no authority
so i shut my mouth and just do what the police tell me.
what the fuck will change?
when all your threats are idle all your dreams are shit
fighting for your rights until you have the chance to do it
a uniform is power they have and you don't
that's why we gotta fight it, but you haven't and you won't
you know you've got the right to say what you believe
you know you've got the right to fight back physically
you know you've got the right to stand up for yourself
you know you've got the right just like everybody else
you know you've got the right, so what are you gonna do about it?
