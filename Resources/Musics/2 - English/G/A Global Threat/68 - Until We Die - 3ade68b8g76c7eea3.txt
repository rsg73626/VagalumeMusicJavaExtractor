UNTIL WE DIE

As so many people suffer from starvation
There is no hope of relief through cooperation
As so many families struggle across the nation
In poverty infested jobs they're forced to work in

[Chorus:]
You bleed and sweat every week but what you earn's not yours to keep
Land of the free? What a lie
You bleed and sweat every week but what you earn's not yours to keep
We won't be free until we die

Evil politicians spend hours debating
And fill the newspapers with lies that they're creating
Will peace or freedom come? I'll probably die waiting
So many of us lose hope our future is fading

[Bridge:]
You put your money in their hands they say we're free in this land
Free to give them what is ours as an innocent man sits behind bars
Serving a crime he did not commit cause some cop was full of shit
You can hope and you can try but you won't be free until you die
