EARACHE

Always gumming how you've got it right,
just buy in, you're that type
no debate, you insist fate will warm you by spotlight
you talk but don't say much, and trends mend what you
like
surround yourself with the wealth of fad and type
You're and earache youre to much for me to take
An earache why won't you go awaay
An earache out looking for hands to shake
An earache a tired contrived two face
Your entire persona fake.
