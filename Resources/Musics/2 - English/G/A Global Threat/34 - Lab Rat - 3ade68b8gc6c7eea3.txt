LAB RAT

no open arms just an open mouth
i guess im supposed to prove myself
you've been here and there and i don't care
but with any response i draw a stare
not gonna feel like your lab rat
in a rut again, they'll offer you twenty
when they know you cant payback ten
subtract the interest from your worth
they cuffed you to your job at birth
not gonna feel like your lab rat
im sick of this tease and flirt
sick of boring snobs in skirts
time to hit the bricks and have a laugh
so don't show unless youve got some class
im not gonna feel like your lab rat
