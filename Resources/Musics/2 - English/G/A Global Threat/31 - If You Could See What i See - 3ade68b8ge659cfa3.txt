IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT I SEE

All of My Life
I Have Dreamed
That Somehow Love Would Find Me
Now I Can't Believe You're Standing Here

If Beauty Is All
In the Eye
Of the Beholder Then I
Wish You Could See
The Love For You That Lives in Me

(Chorus)
And You Would Know You Have My Heart
If You Could See, What I See
That a Treasure's What You Are
If You Could See, What I See
Created to Be
The Only One For Me
If You Could See, What I See

I Know There Are Days
When You Feel
So Much Less Than Ideal
Wondering What I See in You

It's All of the Light
And the Grace
Your Belief in Me Drives Me to Say
That I Promise You
A Faithful Love, Forever True

(Chorus)

If You Could See
Then You'd Understand
Why I Fall Down to My Knees
And I Pray My Love
Will Be Worthy of
The One Who Gave His Life
So Our Love Could Be

If You Could See
What I See(X2)

You're Created to Be
The Perfect One For Me
If You Could See
What I See

If Beauty Is All
In the Eye
Of the Beholder Then I
Am Beholding...
True Beauty
