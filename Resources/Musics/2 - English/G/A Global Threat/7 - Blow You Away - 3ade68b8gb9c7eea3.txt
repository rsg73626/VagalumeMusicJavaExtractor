BLOW YOU AWAY

they've got you and your next move
push buttons for the army
block bullets for the rich
a stupid game, sit back and wait
for the day they decide to...
BLOW YOU AWAY
now you're no more
hang by, they won't feel us die
hold a shovel for the city
push a pencil for the state
still the same, the bombs will rain
down on YOU some day
and... BLOW YOU AWAY
BLOW YOU AWAY
now you're no more
so we all die
but who survives
safe below are suits and ties!
loneley evil breathing guys
first lady's up
fucked for god and buck
or is it just dumb luck
BLOW YOU AWAY
and they'll blow me away
does it matter anyway...
I'll do it first or they'll laugh last
