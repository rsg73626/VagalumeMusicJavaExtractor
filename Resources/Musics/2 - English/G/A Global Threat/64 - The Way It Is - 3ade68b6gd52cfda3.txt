THE WAY IT IS

help me, these kids have escaped the life i condemned them to live
i am the law of the youth i'm armed to control not protect
childhood's spent in school to teach them the ways of the world
then send them to work and to war cause this system's what they reject
i feed them my morals to live to live for the state and the organized church
anyone who thinks for them self is different and doesn't belong
these kids are rebellious and now they need to be stopped right away
they have no respect for the and their will to live is too strong
fuck you you bastards
they don't want a revolution
but a change in power's the only solution
take your laws away
fuck the world and fuck my peers i won't forget the past 18 years
and i won't regret the rest from this
order was established for us, decisions made before we were born
that's how it is and how it will be we live in conditions we hate
the next generation is here. we don't have to live by their rules
respect and compassion are void, but for us it's not too late
fuck you you bastards
the way it is, is the way it was and the way it will stay
just because so many of us want to accept it without a fight
fight back for your right to live any way you want to be
fuck those who refuse to accept your individuality
fuck those who control our future, mentally beating us down
let's show all those fucking stiffs, that we're in deep but we won't drown
fuck you you bastards
take your future back
