ALL WE REALLY OWN

we're told we've got a brand of pride that nothing can
take away engraved in minds from oug to old the
letters u.s.a controlling your emotions and convincing
you its fair but no one ever questions what the voices
say is there and someone could explain to me why
everything's for sale but the one's who make the
profit had the sameone put in jail and everyday in
your hometown the pressure takes its toil another
loyal citizen is hanging from a flag pole the tears
are streaming down his face they shower him with guilt
the thought of what he knew his hands had went ahead
and built and in our hearts we've know it's just
another holocaust that's all really own swallow your
pride
