EVERYONE'S AFRAID

preach about the poisons that contaminate the earth
follow a religion, others question what it's worth
frustrated by the outcome, but never say a word
talk about the causes, but never say a word
we all know the problems
we all know the fear
all have existed, but haven't changed in all these years
talk about the guard who wears the flag on his sleeve
burning in his eyes he's blinded by belief
belief in a structure built in the past
time creates an action, but it better happen fast
hand out all the pamphlets
peel all the stickers
little do we know that the woods are getting thicker
who creates a path
we all know the way
let down your guard, cause everyone's afraid
