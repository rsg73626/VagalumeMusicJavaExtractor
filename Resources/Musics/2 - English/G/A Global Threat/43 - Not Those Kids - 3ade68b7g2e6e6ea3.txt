NOT THOSE KIDS

With my biggest fans and dying of thirst
The scent of trash, a summer musk
Waft through the window
It sounds like upstairs they need a nurse
It seems somebody's got my dreams held up in escrow
One hit and all of it controls you
And if you're not happy there, I don't know who is

Not those kids

Just give it all that you can give
Make something of yourself and don't be such a letdown
It's all one way to LA today, just heed the call
