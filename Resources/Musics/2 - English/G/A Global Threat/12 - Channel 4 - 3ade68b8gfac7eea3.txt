CHANNEL 4

back and forth, t.v. to school, there's not much else you know
they're the only things that feed you what you think, you need to grow
in the meantime, washington's concerned with overseas
establishing (through corporate interest) foreigh policies
get off the bus, walk through the door, a latchkey kid alone
the t.v. is on as soon as you set foot in your home
today is different, news is on instead of normal shows
when i was younger, persian gulf. now kids see kosovo
u.s. army, channel 4
how can you trust anyone who's televised a war
oil, power, channel 3
there's entertainment value in the military
investors increase profit margin, networks boost their ratings
protest turns to celebration and disapproval is fading
thousands die, but war is profit america is grinning
t.v. dinners, fat with pride and thinking we are winning
watch for our prosperity
watch for our economy
watch us die on t.v.
watch us kill humanity
back and forth, t.v. to school, there's not much else you know
they're the only things that feed you what you think, you need to grow
so if you want your kids to learn the morals of modern war
then sit them down at home and they'll tune into channel 4
