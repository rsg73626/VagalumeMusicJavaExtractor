FRIENDLY FIRE

Spread by force at any cost, this great democracy
The middle class will act with tact, see you there
Fly first class on your way to torture for your belief
Or Cuba Gone Wild will film you bare

We stand in a homeland so fearful

Shame on anyone not proud their state was red
Belly's yellow when Islam is after you

But I'm serious that you need one to the head it you
Thought it would change cause your ballot's blue

We stand in a homeland so lethal

With god on our side, we stand in a homeland so spiteful
With some master plan, we stand in the homeland so faithful
