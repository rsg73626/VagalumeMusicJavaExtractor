MY NEIGHBORS

I don't really care if you call me a fag
I've known fags who are better men than you
And I know you're not measured by what you're called
You're measured by what you do

So what's the difference to you? It's not your life
Mild mannered by day, a stupid fuck by night

You're clever and in control of situations you provoke
I can hear you laughing at punch lines
But I didn't hear a joke
