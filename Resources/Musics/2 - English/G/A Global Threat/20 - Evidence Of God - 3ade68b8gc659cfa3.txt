EVIDENCE OF GOD

Every Mountain, Every Valley, the Evidence of God. 

Verse One
I Believe That William Shakespeare Lived Though We Never Met,
'cause When I Was 17 I Read "Romeo & Juliet".
And I Believe There Was a Man Whose Name Was Michaelangelo,
Because He Left His Mark in a Chapel in the Heart of Rome. 

Chorus
Every Mountain, Every Valley
Your Creation, It Surrounds Me.
Every Breath I Breath, Every Heartbeat,
Every Sunrise That You Give to Me.
These and So Much More
Tell a Story We Cannot Ignore,
The Evidence of God. 

Verse Two
As the Potter Shapes His Clay, He Leaves Evidence.
And Our Father Does the Same, His Creation Is Evidence.
That's How We Can Believe in a God We Cannot See Or Hear Or Touch.
If We Will Open Our Eyes We'll See His Work Is All Around Us. 

Chorus
Every Mountain, Every Valley
Your Creation, It Surrounds Me.
Every Breath I Breath, Every Heartbeat,
Every Sunrise That You Give to Me. 

Every Blue Sky, Every Starry Night,
Paint a Picture We Cannot Deny.
Like a Warm Rain in the Summertime,
Like a First Kiss Or a Baby's Cry.
These and So Much More
Tell a Story We Cannot Ignore,
The Evidence of God. 

Bridge
These and So Much More,
Tell a Story We Cannot Ignore.
Even Our Own Lives Will Testify, 

Chorus
Every Mountain, Every Valley
Your Creation, It Surrounds Me.
Every Breath I Breath, Every Heartbeat,
Every Sunrise That You Give to Me. 

Every Blue Sky, Every Starry Night,
Paint a Picture We Cannot Deny.
Like a Warm Rain in the Summertime,
Like a First Kiss Or a Baby's Cry.
These and So Much More
Tell a Story We Cannot Ignore,
Even Our Own Lives Will Testify,
To the Evidence of God, the Evidence of God 

Hallelujah, We Are the Evidence of God.
