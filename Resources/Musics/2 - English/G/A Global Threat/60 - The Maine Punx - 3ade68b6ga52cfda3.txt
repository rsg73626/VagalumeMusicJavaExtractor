THE MAINE PUNX

we're the maine punx, fuck you!
proud to be the fucking few
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
all the shit that we go through
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
we'll do what we want to do
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
young, rebellious attitudes

pack up the car, it's time to go!
150 miles to the nearest show
punks from around the state destroy
this way of living, OI! OI! OI!

get shit about what we wear,
patches, boots, and spikey hair
fuck what we're taught in all our schools,
we won't live by this state's rules

we're the maine punx, fuck you!
proud to be the fucking few
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
all the shit that we go through
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
we'll do what we want to do
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
young, rebellious attitudes

we're the maine punx, fuck you!
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
we're the maine punx, fuck you!
we're the maine punx, fuck you!

and FUCK MAINE
