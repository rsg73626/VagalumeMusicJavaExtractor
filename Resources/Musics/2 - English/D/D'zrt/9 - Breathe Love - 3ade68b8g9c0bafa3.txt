BREATHE LOVE

Lift your feet from the floor
Now drink and ask for more
The club is pumping
Someone tell the bouncer to shut the door

Let's get the party started
Make it crazy like no other
Let's just forget the problems 
And breathe love tonight

Breathe love tonight, like never before

Wanna breathe love tonight
Tonight, we make love tonight
