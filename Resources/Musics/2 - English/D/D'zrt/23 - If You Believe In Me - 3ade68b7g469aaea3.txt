IF YOU BELIEVE IN ME

D'zrt - If you believe in me   
     
See no picture of you, no
We never ended this right, so
Now I’m back and on time
Strong enough to keep you in mind

How could I miss such beautiful lips
When I can’t deny just a look in your eyes
Takes me higher than high
I just realize

Time is passing by
I tremble as I try
To tell you why
I’m so confused
And it has to turn out right

Refrão:
Just one minute of your time you need
Just one hour I can never let you be
Must go on like a heart with a beat
If you believe in me
I always wanna be

Imagine roses frozen but alive
So sad I wonder could you be mine
I’m drawing cause I can’t write
It feels like snow in July

When I can’t reply to a question it’s you
I’m awake all night, can’t sleep ‘cause it’s you
There’s nothing left for me to hide
You beat up my world inside
 
Time is passing by
I tremble as I try
To tell you why
I’m so confused
And it has to turn out right

Refrão:
Just one minute of your time you need
Just one hour I can never let you be
Must go on like a heart with a beat
If you believe in me
I always wanna be
