BY ANY MEANS

I'm feeling
"Why try anymore?" 

The ice is broken 
The page is open now 
For all the world to see 
We've scratched the surface 
For what it's worth 
We've beaten odds 
Against our ways 

By any means 
We are the ones who want to be 
On our own (waste deep in need) 
By any means 
We're all aboard 
The destinations unknown 
We're chasing the day 

We've raised our standards 
We've questioned answers from 
The ones who brought us up 
We've braced ourselves so 
It's getting old to hear 
The things that matter most 

Never coming down 

Stumble out of the dark 
To find whats in the light is not 
Appealing anymore 
What we ask for might not be 
Appealing anymore
