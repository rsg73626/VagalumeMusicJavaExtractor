THE CYCLE

We'll end this all tonight
Wanna turn your back to me
When it's my turn to insert the knife
Well, shame on you, coward
You can't bleed enough to please my eyes
Please my eyes
Please my eyes
Welcome the cycle, it's churning
It patiently waits for revenge out of rage
Transition eludes the eye
When the first sight seen was the last of me
Wanted to know
Now it tears you up inside
The feelings went long ago and myself
I pray one last time

The ending is what I'm waiting for
As I've tried and loved you well

But it's never eough to please
Yet my tounge stayed tied
And these eyes never looked down on you
But you turned your back when I needed a friend
This will end
I'm bringing the house down
And I'm taking my memories with me
When you fall your reign will shatter
And now I'm prepared for

The ending is what I'm waiting for
As I've tried and loved you well!

We'll end this all tonight
Wanna turn your back to me
When it's my turn to insert the knife
Well, shame on you, coward
You cant bleed enough to please my eyes
Please my eyes
Welcome the cycle
It surely anticipates your company
This day was your last to wake to the sight of this

The ending is what I'm waiting for
