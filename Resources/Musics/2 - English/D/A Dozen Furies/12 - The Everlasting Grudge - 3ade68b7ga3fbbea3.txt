THE EVERLASTING GRUDGE

You planted the seed inside her head
To cultivate it and help it grow into a monster
Your out of control so she’ll know just what your all about
My dreams of you and thoughts of prevision, how you ripped my heart away
I’m calling out for blood! There’s no, escape from what you’ve done, to us!
Or my dreams of molar in false or will I encounter you once more!
To say that my prayers won’t be answered
If they arise from deep inside of hatred
To say that the guilt is unbearable and undying
So save the satisfaction of revenge will fill no void
Means you know nothing of me. Means you know nothing of me.
Where ever you may sleep, just know, that I will not forget
As my dream unravels your brain(your brain)
You'll see I'm tourtured this way!!!
To say that my prayers won’t be answered
If they arise from deep inside of hatred
To say that the guilt is unbearable and undying
So save the satisfaction of revenge will fill no void
Means you know nothing of me. Means you know nothing of me.
This everlasting hatred of you is all I needed to carry on…
This everlasting hatred of you is all I needed to carry on!
You planted the seed, inside her head
To cultivate and watch it grow into a monster!
You’re out of control! (Control) I can’t let this go!
You’re out of control! (Control) I can’t let you go!
