NIGHTMARE OF A MARTYR

Carry on, you must feel that, you have something to die for.
Infact, you can't afford to, take time away from you.
Don't want your pitty!
Just once
Respect
My Life! Turn back and walk away!
YEAH!!
GO!!!
That's right, thats right. Your skies turn grey
That's right, betray, betray your life away
There's someone out there!
There's someone better out there, yeah they're for me.
YEAH!!
Taste the rain, let it fall around you.
Flood your sins away, BEG, GIRL, BEG!
Get ready, a force fit now here to judge you.
Respect the phenom, give your life away.
And through, your eyes, you had the world fooled,
And through your lessons, you fooled yourself, yeah!
The way she sees it, with no regret,
The way she spins her web!
Well you're not opossed to being a martyr.
Get a grip on your life, or this will end.
Get a grip on your life, or this will end
And I'm not opossed to taking your life away!
Get a grip on your life, or this will end
Get a grip on your life, or this will end
This will end!
This will end!
YEAH!!
Haha, she plays the victim, walking away.
And won't let it die, will you?
Won't let it die, will you?
Won't let it die.
Well, you're not opossed to being a martyr,
And I'm not opossed to taking your life away!
Get a grip on your life, or this will end
Get a grip on your life, or this will end
