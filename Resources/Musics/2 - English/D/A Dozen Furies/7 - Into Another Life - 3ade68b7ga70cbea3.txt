INTO ANOTHER LIFE

And you could be the one,
And this could be an ending to us and our world,
Yeah you could be the one,
Yeah you could be the one,
And this could be an ending to us and our world,

Force me your sacred scripture,
To have changed me back this far now,
Our worlds have the habit to fall,
What I did was try to break yours down,

Yeah you could be the one,
Position not afflicted,
Send in the conqueror,
Send in the death of my beliefs,

If all we've ever known turned out to be a misery,
That's all we'd have, yeah,

Behold the bitterness and everything we leave,
To think that I'm gonna see you,
And it could be a war possessed with all this weakness,
Send down the conqueror that can transport all like its off into a new world,

If all we've ever known turned out to be a bit unreal,
Or maybe, make believe,
Its all we ever need,
A story to believe,
And that's all we have,

We wake into another time,
We wake within another life,
We wake another time,
Into another life,
Into another life.
