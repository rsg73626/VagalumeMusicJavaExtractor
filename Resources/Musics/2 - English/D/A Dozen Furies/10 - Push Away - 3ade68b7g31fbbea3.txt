PUSH AWAY

You think it would be best
If I'm put to rest
Push push push away
And think I can't
See right through you

See where that got you
I see you crawling

Save your breath
Close your eyes
Wipe that look about your face
Now

Push push push away
Until you're satisfied now
With this distance between us
Yeah I still see through you

See where it got you
I see you crawling

Save your breath
Close your eyes
Wipe that look about your face
