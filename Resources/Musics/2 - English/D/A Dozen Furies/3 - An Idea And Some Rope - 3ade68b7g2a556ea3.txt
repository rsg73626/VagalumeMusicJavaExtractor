AN IDEA AND SOME ROPE

Come on!

You stand before me changing faces and,
Disguise your word as truth as though its good,
I know we’ll never meet again,
I know you’ll suffer in the end,
Found out that life is but a dream,
What I want is what you’ve taken,

Pride calls out again,
When I pray for silence
And await the worst that comes for me,
So long this is goodbye,
To everything you ever did to keep me away,

This life you chose to prey upon,
It moves around,
I take it back, I take it back,

I know we’ll never meet again,
And I know you’ll suffer in the end,
Found out that life is but a dream,
What I want is what you’ve taken,

Pride calls out again,
When I pray for silence
And await the worst that comes for me,
So long this is goodbye,
To everything you ever did to keep me away,

When the bridge is burning down,
You’ll pay the price in full,

Pride calls out again,
When I pray for silence,
And await the worst that comes for me,
So long this is goodbye,
To everything you ever did to keep me away,

You stand before me changing faces and,
Disguise your word as truth as though its good
