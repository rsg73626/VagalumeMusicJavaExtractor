AWAKE AND LIFELESS

The taste of bitterness your rolling eyes leave such a void.
This part of you I can't controll
I won't ignore so...
Salvage the truth your story was a dream
You're awake and lifeless the lying wheels are turning round and round we go.

The bottom is open
Crawl straight to him, it seems he made you, what you are.(what you are.)
A reflection of the wrong
A reflection
An image to oppose

Ya you say you are what your not
To try to build it up inside. (inside)
Take a deep look beyond the depths that you roam.
You'll find you want it all under your controll

Awake and Lifeless
You only open up your eyes enough to show you care less...Than you do
You paint the picture
How you want, without the truth, it's worthless.

Fix this fault about yourself before your dead and rotting
A brutal calling for the weak
Set aside the greed

Salvage your truth the story was a dream but you're
Awake and lifeless the lying wheels are turning

Awake and Lifeless
You only open up your eyes enough to show you care less...Than you do
You paint the picture
How you want, without the truth, it's worthless.
GO
(YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

The bottom is open
crawl straight to him, it seems he made you, what you are. (what you are)(what you are)
A reflection of the wrong
A reflection
An image to oppose!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

An image(an image) to(to) oppose(oppose)
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
