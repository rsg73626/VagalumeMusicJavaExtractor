JUST LIKE DOGS

Evident formulas 
To the unformal 
Appetite 
Scenting the vestige 
Of a menstrual prey 
Forced from an inner vision 
Of life 
Ostracized by lies 
Morally demised 
Far from sights 
I am watching you 
My own conduct 
Just to pacify 
My luxury 
Evil vibes and gluttony 
I react to my instinct 
And realise 
My rabid thirst for iniquities 
New form of control 
Force fed carnal growth 
Over you 
I crawl... 
Simple guidance to the goal 
JUST LIKE DOGS 
one of a kind 
JUST 
A mammal into rut 
LIKE 
A ruthless canidae 
DOGS 
In lewd female hogs 
Smell the ones to confine 
Unique and unnatural 
Is the way to corrode 
Your crotch and your soul 
I can read you now 
Pig 
My physiognomy 
My morbidity 
JUST 
LIKE 
DOGS
