RAGING HORMONES

"Look at me 
And say what you want" 
Imbued in love 
Till my puberty 
Hormones subverted 
And buried the infant in me 
Meager in moral 
And religious beliefs 
Evilly evolved 
From promiscuous needs 
Bizarre drills 
To refine 
My own skills 
Deep inside 
You…to stain your ego 
You…to scar your nook 
Look at me and say 
What you want 
On your knees 
The glans on your tongue 
Slowly I feed… 
My will… your fear… 
Sudden crave to defile 
Your holes 
Your heart 
Scrabbling hands 
In explosive anger 
In a tumultuous 
Virile manner 
Submit and spread 
Your worthless legs 
To molest your crotched nest 
Boisterous abuse 
Far beyond 
This mutual carnal existence 
Andro vehemence 
Rudely galls 
Your sweet exposed genitals 
Let them flow 
RAGING HORMONES 
Prevail 
Through the blood stream 
Resign 
Let your 
RAGING HORMONES 
Flow
