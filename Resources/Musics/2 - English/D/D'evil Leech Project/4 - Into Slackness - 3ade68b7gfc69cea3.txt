INTO SLACKNESS

Our 
Innate feeling 
Sexual 
From twisted minds 
Sympathy 
For the interpose perversion 
False 
Measurable greed 
Why donâ€™t you bleed your mind 
Fuck all behind 
Take your time 
And let that all go dry 
In times 
Before the lies 
Enrapture need 
to feed the inner soul 
Becoming object 
of euphorical behaviour 
SLACKNESS 
Lack conduct 
To complain failure, (in pleasure) 
Insert stress 
In her twisted corporal anxiety 
BLEED YOUR MIND 
Take your time 
And let that all go dry 
Monomaniac 
Feeding from demur 
Monomaniac 
Feeding from regret 
INTO SLACKNESS 
Our innate feel 
Sexual evidence 
From twisted minds 
Redundant creature 
Provided feebleness 
Deglutition 
Fever 
Lack of perseverance
