PAINT YOUR HEAD

RED 
So obsessed to possess 
To wear the sweet flesh 
To invade and pervade 
Every gash meant to slash 
Molesting the bodies 
In forms beyond your fancies 
Disturbing with fervor 
Disclosing all the horrors 
Decoying your reason 
Into a new perception 
Corroding your morals 
Corrupting all the colors 
RED 
PAINT YOUR HEAD RED 
(*)Till the last breath 
Let the others dread 
Sorely gashed 
Gored to death 
((((((((((Disturbing with fervorDisclosing all the horrorsCorroding your moralsCorrupting all the colors)))))))))))))Red 
I will make you pled 
Red 
Diced into shreds 
Red 
Ethics will be shed 
Red 
I will make you pled 
Have you ever fantasize 
Copulating deep inside 
Fornicating other´s mind 
Breaking one more time 
Violate the mind 
I will make it blind 
And when all has bled 
I will paint it 
RED 
PAINT YOUR HEAD RED 
(*)Have you ever fantasize 
Copulating deep inside 
Fornicating other’s mind 
Breaking one more time 
One more time 
I will paint it 
I will 
PAINT YOUR HEAD RED
