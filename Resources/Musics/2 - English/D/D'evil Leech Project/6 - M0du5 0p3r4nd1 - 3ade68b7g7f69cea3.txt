Pointed process 
Ad interium precise 
As the embodiment of mind 
Ravish and oppress 
Cold… cold… 
Sense flowing 
Through the veins 
A charge of 
Pleasuring flames 
My breath despised 
(*)Enslaved reason 
Impelling force 
Without restrain 
MODUS OPERANDI 
Free evil vibes 
MODUS OPERANDI 
Frivolous conduct 
Lewdness response 
Methodical routine 
Enrapture by grief 
Expressed a 
Feeling of fondness 
Overwhelmed 
By mental sensing 
I realise the ways 
To the flesh 
In methodical atrocity 
I lay my vengeance 
Upon you 
Compensate the injury 
Eager the void 
The carnal remains 
Invade…in sodomy 
Increase the blast 
Intensity 
Release the grasp ! 
Eager the void 
The carnal remains.
