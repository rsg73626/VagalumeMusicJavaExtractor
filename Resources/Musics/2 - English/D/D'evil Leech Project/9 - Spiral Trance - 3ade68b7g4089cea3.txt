SPIRAL TRANCE

Screaming the way I need 
Shocking beyond belief 
Held down 
Of getting down the 
SPIRAL TRANCE 
A descending obscure state 
To a blurred lower stage 
Systematic conduct 
Methodical stream 
Held down 
My mind awaits the implosion 
Going down through the spiral alone 
Between dive and crash 
An unpleasant path 
Helical 
Courses coiling around me 
Suffocating 
In a dream killing spree 
Sinking fast 
In a piercing blast 
Caged and bound 
Being forced 
Into the ground 
Enforced by the body weight 
That imprisoned all my hate 
Anesthetized the fallen past 
Senseless Existence 
Now feeding from revenge 
Downward spiral 
Transitory lack of strength 
To release omnipotence 
Now I’m rising, to excrete 
All my anger underneath 
"My skin… 
Underneath my skin 
Now I can feel 
All the hatred 
Caustically enclosed 
(Bitterly confined)
Evolving to discharge…" 
What i’ve lost 
I will no longer need 
just want you to feed 
My dry and thirsty mind 
With the horrors 
That I will grind 
Bleed 
Languidly 
Burst 
In agony 
There you lie 
In your grave 
Merely a pile of your body waste 
(This… harsh)
