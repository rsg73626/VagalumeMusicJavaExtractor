EMOTIONALLY VOIDED

Injected pain 
With the purpose of clemency 
Purged all the past 
Enlivened the malignancy 
Atrocious visions exhibited 
Through spasms of repugnance 
Mischievous effigies 
Suffocate piteous tendencies 
"My fingers slide through her greasy hair, 
Looking into her feeble eyesâ€¦ 
Touching her ulcerous skin, 
Hearing her bowels..." 
Fermenting inside 
Smoothing her cracked lips 
Tasting her wrinkled tongue 
Scenting the rotten breath 
The rotten breath from her lungs ! 
"Penetrating her hairy sewer, 
As I caress her relaxed sphincter, 
Her nauseating osmidrosis..." 
Ravish my nostrils 
EMOTIONALLY VOIDED 
Anencephalic blander 
Sham so 
So ingenuously 
Regurgitated the sourness 
Of treachery 
Nymphomaniac whore, pervert 
Deceiving, trying to destroy me ! 
Untrustful emotions 
All false and deprived of sense 
EMOTIONALLY VOIDED 
Sterile for better percipience 
EMOTIONALLY 
EMOTIONALLY VOIDED 
Untrustful emotions 
All false and deprived of sense 
EMOTIONALLY VOIDED 
You never stood a chance 
EMOTIONALLY 
EMOTIONALLY VOIDED 
"Penetrating her hairy sewer, 
As I caress her relaxed sphincter, 
Her nauseating osmidrosis..." 
Ravish my nostrils
