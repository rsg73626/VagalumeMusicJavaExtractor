MADNESS

Jami oji anneun bame angigopeun mame
Jeonhwagil deureo bone jebal batgireul
Natseon geoure bichin pume angin nae moseube
Huhoehal geol almyeonseodo heolbeoseun nae momeul bone

It is an act of madness
But I know that I'll do again

And I been a rolling the with him
Disgusting of me now

No rago nan malhago sipeodo
Onmomi neol wonhago itjanha
Guji niga anieodo dareun saram chatgetji
Muri anin gireumcheoreom seokkiji anketji

Mami anin momi pillyohan geoya ani
Momi anin mami pillyohan geoya
Oerowo yeojaigo sipeo

It is an act of madness
But I know that I'll do again

And I been a rolling the with him
Disgusting of me

It is an act of madness
But I know that I'll do again

And I been a rolling the with him
Disgusting of me now

It is an act of madness
But I know that I'll do again

And I been a rolling the with him
Disgusting of me now
