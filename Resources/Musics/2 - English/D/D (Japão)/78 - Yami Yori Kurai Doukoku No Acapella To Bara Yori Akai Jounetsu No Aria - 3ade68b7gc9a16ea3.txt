YAMI YORI KURAI DOUKOKU NO ACAPELLA TO BARA YORI AKAI JOUNETSU NO ARIA

My Dear rose. You are all of me in this world. 
In now, the past, and the future, I sing for you. 

naraku no soko chi wo haugoe yami yori kurai doukoku no AKAPERA 
kokoro mitasu ten ni furugoe bara yori akai jounetsu no ARIA 

I never know pleasure to live. 
Why was I born such ugly? 
(Why?) (You wish?) (Your mind?) 

ichido dake ai sarete mitai kono minikui kamen no shita made mo 
kono yo ni umarete ai wo shirazu ni yami ni tstsumareta mama de... 

You must choose! Come with me! 

Nobody can stop me! 

I never know pleasure to live. 
Why was I born such ugly? 
(Why?) (You wish?) (Your mind?) 

tomoshibi dake atsuku mune kogasu ai no owari wasure wa shinai kara 
saa iku ga ii zutto kimi ga hikari ni tsutsumareru you ni... 

If you will forget, but even so i will remember forever and ever. 

My Dear rose. You are all of me in this world. 
In now, the past, and the future. I sing for you. 

kono yo ni umarete ai wo shirazu ni yami ni tsutsumareta mama de...
