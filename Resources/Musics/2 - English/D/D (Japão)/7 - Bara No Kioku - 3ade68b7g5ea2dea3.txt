BARA NO KIOKU

Saihate ni sobieru zanzou to kyomu no uzu fukashita boku wo nomikomu
hadaka de kanjiru kioku no [PURISUMU] ga kagayaki wo ubawareteku

Ooto mo tatezu shinshutsukibotsu no tsukimatou kage kara

Wakiagaru akui fu no iki ga oou

"Time to end" "Here and now"

Saigo ni nokotta [NANO SAIZU] no boku ga mabuta no kimi wo mitsuketa
torimodoshite yuku jinkaku to kioku kaiba kara nagareru "watashi"

Henka togeta tsubasa ga kyouko na tate tonari arasou wa futatabi boku no naka ubaiau
"Time to end" "Here and now"

"Let your mercies come to me, that I may keep living" ...for me.
"Please, may the badness of wicked ones come to an end" ...for you.
For your salvation my soul has pined away.

Muse kaeru bara no tsugi no naka nemuru kimi no tamashii ni kuchiukete dakitoseru
"Time to end" "Here and now"

"Let your mercies come to me, that I may keep living" ...for me.
"Please, may the badness of wicked ones come to an end" ...for you.

I feel on my kness to pray.
My soul does thirst for you.

Hontou wa jibun no kako nado doudemo ikatta no kamoshirenai...
mata kimi to onaji jikan wo sugosu koto ga dekiru naraba...
