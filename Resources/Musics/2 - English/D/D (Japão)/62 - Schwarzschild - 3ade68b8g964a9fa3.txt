SCHWARZSCHILD

Time to say farewell to this world.

Even if it was "The Black Shield"...
There is the shield in order to protect everyone

All vampire's sin are my sin. Because the cause is in me.
I must atone for past Deeds. That is, it indicates the Death.

My blood wasn't able to be exterminated by sunlight.
all was mistake and meaningless

This blood, lineage should perish and never awake.
Up to the last drop of the blood.

However I was feeling sadness always
Because we are the vampires which are always hungry
for blood, and have to continue living in the Dark
As Dust return to Dust, I will also return to ashes

Even if it was "The Black Shield"...
There is the shield in order to protect everyone

All vampire's sin are my sin. Because the cause is in me.
I must atone for past Deeds.

Loneliness and pain made the Desire amplify
and malice became mighty nightly

I wish to liberate you from "Blood Oath"
Please understand this feeling of mine

saa oide yoru no kodomo tachi
nemure eien no kodoku wo maneku nakare

aisarezu ni umare kuru mono wa dare hitori i nai
arubeki sugata e kaerou kami no ina wo yobimotomete

owari naki yami ni ooi naru hikari are ten yori

shika to mita kokoro no me de sagashi motometa sugata
awaremi no tokiataeru kami no ikokoro wa kotaete
idai naru ai wa fukaku samayoeru mono de sae
kaerarenu mitrai nado nai kami no imae nite chikatte

yagate tsumi no shi wa otozure kurushimi wa sari ima wa nemuri e...

If God give me hug gently some day
I will know true meaning of the eternity

There're few people who can find out the narrow gate to the paradise
but I wish to meet you again

If I can live with you on God's side, it's very wonderful
Only God saves us...
God saves us...
God saves us.
