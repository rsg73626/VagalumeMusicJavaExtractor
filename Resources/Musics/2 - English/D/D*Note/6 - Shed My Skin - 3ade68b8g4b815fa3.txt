SHED MY SKIN

I'm running.. through the fields
Laughing.. dreaming..
I'm driving.. through the mountains
Breathing.. a new life

Chorus:

I don't mind what people say
No, I won't look back for another day
Wanna shed my skin and walk away.. x2

I'm floating.. through the river
Twisting.. and turning..
Running through the suns
Searching.. a new life

Chorus
