I LIKE

I like i like i like i like oh
My dreams are now reality
Each and every time you are here with me
A touch, you give me with you hand
You caress my skin
I'm under your command
Girl you hypnotize me with you eyes
It took me some time but now i realize
It's you to whom which i belong
I love it, the feeling's getting strong
I like, the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, it really turns me on
I like the way the feeling's getting strong
Oh girl you are my lover
When i'm with you there is no other
A spell you've got me under
Please don't you leave
I'm on my hands and knees
Words can't express the way i feel
Emotions for you oh so real
Girl you love me over and over again
Don't stop it please don't let it end
I like, the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, it really turns me on
I like the way feeling's getting strong
You know i love it--hey girl
You know i care, sugar,
You know i like it, baby
I like i like the way you wear your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
The way you kiss me
I feel warm
Gimme all you lovin' all night long
