LOVING FIRE

The calming hope from you my deepest love
There s nothing to say.
Just hold me in Your arms and take me away
As we stand in the burning storm here

You gave us hearts, In place of yours.
And they hear our cries
But can t see Your eyes...

From above.
I close my eyes and see your love.
Chasing  now .
Break our hearts and show us now

The quiet in the darkest night
Your arms are here to hold me tight
You are the one we run to now
Tell us  breathe,  and show us how
[Closer] Just to close my eyes.
[Deeper] Just to fall in love with You
