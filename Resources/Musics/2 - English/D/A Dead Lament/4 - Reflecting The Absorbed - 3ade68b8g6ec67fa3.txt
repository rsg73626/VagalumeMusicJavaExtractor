REFLECTING THE ABSORBED

a thousand mirrors tell you of a thousand people
no need to have more friends.

hunting for brightness in the dark
it's already dawning
you sense but you can't feel the warmth
that is surrounding you

it is surrounding me, too

everything around you blurs to colors far beyond your
comprehension seems to tremble tumble fall down to the bottom
to the dirt
sure it hurts but you need to be punched
in order to gain back your consciousness to say the words that matter most
let me live again

I need to free me from myself
I can defeat the monster on my own
I will succeed against myself to
understand

that I'm all alone

hunting for brightness in the dark
you sense but you can't feel the warmth
that is surrounding every part of your body
but what is warmth good for
if it's bouncing back from the inside
as long as you are scared
as long as you're not able to absorb
cold is all you will reflect

you spoke the words that matter most
most in your opinion
just force the ego to let go
you're not alone

you spoke the words

infectious as a rabic bite the shadows of your past determine
acting level-headed seems to be an inconceivable idea
but your plea will never match the plan
as long as you just stare at yourself to demand a satisfying state
let yourself live again
