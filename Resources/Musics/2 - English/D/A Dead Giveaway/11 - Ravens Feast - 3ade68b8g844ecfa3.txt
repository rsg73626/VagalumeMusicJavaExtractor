RAVENS FEAST

When the light gets dark and the sun goes down,
she feels the cold that ascends her neck.

When the light gets dark and the sun goes down,
she feels the cold that ascends her neck.
Her stomach hurts, her arms are weak.
Empty eyes, fulfilled with fear and hate.

Here they come. Time to die. Cut the wrist or learn to fly.
Here they come. Time to die. Cut the wrist or learn to fly.
All the pain that she's gone through won't abate.

Soundless cries drowning in the flood of tears.
Bones break as blood spills.
Laughter drowns the whipping belt that smashs her face.
Delight goes by - a ray of hope.

When the light gets dark and the sun goes down,
she feels the cold that ascends her neck.
Her stomach hurts, her arms are weak.
Empty eyes, fulfilled with fear and hate.

Secure in the last corner of the room.
the little kneels down
she feels her heart beat - feels her heart beat
she can hear him shout
and this when she hears him walk
up the stairs he comes
all the way he shouts
this is when she cries
this is when she falls

When the light gets dark and the sun goes down,
she feels the cold that ascends her neck.
Her stomach hurts, her arms are weak.
Empty eyes, fulfilled with fear and hate.

But as she walks off
the house gets brighter
the flames rise higher.
and you brun down
