CRYING IN CRIMSON

From the moment I started to think about
how roses could paint
such a picture in my head
hearing the sound of your voice
cause it seems so restless
Its so hard again to speak the words
silence broken could mean the end
for a certain time of heartache
(time of heartache)
cant we pretend its a new day
when the night is as far as close from empty
you can't forget what they all say
you'll never foret all the time you're spending

(screaming)

And I'll be waiting there
with a smile on my face
I live with nothing but a trace
And we're far from reality i swear
It's like a perfect picture paradise
It's only seen through clear blue skies
tonight, the only night
I'll ever get to make this something right
just let me be alright
(just let me make this something right)

cross out the happy ending
so we can try and stop pretending
to see and understand the messages
our hearts are sending
tonight, the only chance we'll ever get to,survive
I'll make this right but I wont let you
take this time
maybe there's a reason
to have these thoughts
change even more with the season
lay low while the stars are fading
be low when the lights are waiting
dead roses painted on the floor
the door closes nothing ever more
It's never been like this before(x4)
It's never really been like this before!
before!

And I'll be waiting there
with a smile on my face
I live with nothing but a trace
And we're far from reality i swear
It's like a perfect picture paradise
It's only seen through clear blue skies
tonight, the only night
I'll ever get to make this something right
just let me be alright
just let me make this something right
