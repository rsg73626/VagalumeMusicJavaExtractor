SHIPWRECK(IN COLORADO)

Remember the things you said to me
When we were on the phone
Dont ever think you're crying to be left alone
Ambitions still flying against yourself 
You'll never know 
The ones you love will often come and go
The passion you put behind yourself unknown 
To those who never take the chance to let it show 

Each time we go out on our own, 
To play those silly games you play with me
I cant forget
Tonight ill ask myself again, 
Why did i ever change the way i felt? 
I felt for you 

So quiet, i wait impatiently 
But you havent cared 
Another apology has left me unaware 
For something to come unexpectantly 
I dissappeared, you think that people would know after all these years 
Where have i left? 
Where have i gone? 
Will no one know? 
To find the answers that will come along 

Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me
I cant forget
Tonight ill ask myself again
Why did i ever change the way i felt? 
I felt for you 

Cry, cry, cry...

Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me
I cant forget
Tonight ill ask myself again
Why did i ever change the way i felt? 
I felt for you

Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me
I cant forget
Tonight ill ask myself again
Why did i ever change the way i felt? 
I felt for you
