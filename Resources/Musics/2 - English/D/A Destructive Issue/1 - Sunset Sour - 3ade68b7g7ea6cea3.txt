SUNSET SOUR

Hurt me, hold me back.That is all I need.
Show me life and death. Blow me, on your knees.

Deathless Disguise, keeps me alive.

Can you taste it?
Strangers in the city, that we called our kingdom.
Can you feel it?
Feeding off the ashes, of our fallen idols.

Rape me, give me lust. Choking, on the dust.
Burning, of our souls. Bleeding, rock and roll!
