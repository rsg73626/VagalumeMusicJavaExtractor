THE EMBALMMENT

Lies that offer closure,
Leaves this fake exposure
Eyes, that never follow time
Give me cocaine pleasures, for a better measure.
I can't take this biting line...

Spit it out spit, spit it out spit!,
Take it out, take, take it out, fake!

And I will be here waiting, and we will be here waiting,
Let the life of the words come alive unrehearsed
I won't let go....

Taste the tounge of pleasure, keep it there forever
stiched, into our bloodshot eyes
Fake, the raging seizure is this burning fever
lost, forever in too minds.
