PLAY ME THE SONG

sun is setting fire to the sky tonight
lucky are the ones who are not alone
lovely boy walked me home from the bar tonight
I love his smile
when he playes the guitar
Iâ€™m saying;

&laquo;play me the song that your father taught you
fill me with peace
because I need it bad&raquo;
oh, wonderful sunset strikes me deaf and blind 
and Iâ€™m so relieved; thereâ€™s a life after him

he was young and promised me the world, you know
but inside I knew it wouldnâ€™t be
every goodbye is leading to a new hello
now look at me - with mister T
Iâ€™m singing;

play me the song that your father taught you
fill me with peace
because I need it bad&raquo;
oh, wonderful sunset strikes me deaf and blind 
and Iâ€™m so relieved; thereâ€™s a life after......

I still enjoy my sunsets
and sunrises too
keep sitting here beside me and play
play me through the night
play me through the day
