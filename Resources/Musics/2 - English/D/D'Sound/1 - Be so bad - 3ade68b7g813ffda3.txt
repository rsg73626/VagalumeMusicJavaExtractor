BE SO BAD

I donâ€™t mind to let the day go by
when iâ€™m sitting inside, sun is on the sky
but I hate getting no reply,
just the echo of me from the walls

all day long Iâ€™ve been by myself
writing funky tunes, talking to no one else
I donâ€™t know why this turns me on
and I really, really need someone

I wanna be so bad, feeling someone else around me

People say that I am so uptight
well, if that is true, Iâ€™m someone else tonight
feeling urges I canâ€™t controll
- I want you to be the first to know

sing â€˜bout love when it is not in sight
I stay in all day and I stay up all night
I know what could make me feel alright
and I really, really; I need someone!

like me! I wanna mean so much to you
