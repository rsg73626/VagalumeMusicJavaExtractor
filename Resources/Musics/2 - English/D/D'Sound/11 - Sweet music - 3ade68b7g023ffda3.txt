SWEET MUSIC

you play me
you know me
I dig what
you show me
I never
get tired listening to your sweet music

oh, dj!
you play me
the bassline
consumes me
I wanna get swept away listening to your sweet music
and

oh; Iâ€™m feeling so much lighter
oh; you take away the day
oh; Iâ€™m feeling so much better
you play me, dj, when you play your sweet music
 
you touch me
you grab me
you make me 
feel happy
that I came here tonight
- listening to your sweet music

the breakdowns
the build up
progression
- delicate!
the night has started when I hear your sweet music

oh; Iâ€™m feeling so much lighter
oh; you take away the day
oh; Iâ€™m feeling so much better
you play me, dj, when you play your sweet music
