GIRLS (WANT EVERYTHING THEY SEE)

Iâ€™d like someone to hold me
I donâ€™t like the way you tease me through the night
you tell me youâ€™ve got something for me
why donâ€™t go ahead and make this wrong a right?

do you wanna make me crazy?
torture me with what I see but cannot touch
why do you spend the evening with me?
are you not content or do I ask for much?

girls want everything they see
donâ€™t you play your games with me

you can be so very friendly
are you afraid youâ€™re gonna overstep my line?
cautiousness can come in handy
but how could you overlook my ready-signs?

do you wanna test my patience?
if you do, you have been taking it too far
I am melting like an ice cube
wanna take the wrapping off my chocolate bar

but you know youâ€™re wrong
and I know Iâ€™m right
and no one â€˜s going
putting out my light
Iâ€™ll get you there
tonight, I swear
