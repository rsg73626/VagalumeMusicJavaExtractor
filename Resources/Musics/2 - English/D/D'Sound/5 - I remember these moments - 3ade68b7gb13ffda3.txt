I REMEMBER THESE MOMENTS

i remember your crooked smile
i remember the glow in your eyes
i remember these moments, baby, with you

kind of beauty you fall into
kind of thought makes you painfully true
i remember these moments, baby, with you

do you still see me reach for you
- the way you used to care?
do you still think i should be, baby,
with you?

i remember the warning signs
i remember i paid them no mind
cause i wanted this moment, baby, with you

when it rained but i didnâ€™t cry
when i left without saying goodbye
i remember that moment, baby, do you?

reach for you
missing you
secretly 
recalling what has been
- i donâ€™t wanna remember
