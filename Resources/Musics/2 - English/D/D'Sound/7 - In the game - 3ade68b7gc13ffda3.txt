IN THE GAME

lesson learned
page is turned
picture burned

party dates
are confirmed
backup-friends
are adjourned

if I knew what i wanted
I would go and get it right away

but I am in the game again
remembering my name again

hope destroyed
heart is annoyd
feel the void

brand new dress
for excess
look your best 

I go on and on and on
I canâ€™t stop my heart from beating
I go on and on and on
always chasing what Iâ€™m needing
