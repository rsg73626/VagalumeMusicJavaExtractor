TATTOOED ON MY MIND

Baby you'll soon forget about all,
or maybe you'll miss it like I do.
One thingâ€™s for sure Iâ€™m on a doubt, spend too much time thinkinâ€™ of you

chorus
And I can't get you out of my dreams
Now I know that you're the dangerous kind
And your smile is tattooed on my mind
And I can't get you out of my dreams

Don't wanna write,
I don't wanna call,
I would not know what to say
It should be you
Thatâ€™s how I want it to be
Tell me you feel the same way

chorus
And I can't get you out of my dreams
Now know that you're a danger first kind
And your smile is tattooed on my mind
And I can't get you out of my dreams...oh!

Oh, Yesterday, I was feelin' safe, oh 
All I do today is tryinâ€™ to be great
and no melody can seem to suit my mind...
and now I curse you for being so sweet and so kind

chorus
And I can't get you out of my dreams
Now I know that you're a dangerous kind
And your face is tattooed on my mind
And I can't get you out of my dreams..

Yes I know you're tattooed
