SUNSHINE

ohh, sunshine
baby, you change the weather
when you say &laquo;come on!&raquo;, sunshine
party never seems to end

jamming on
after midnight
in the club
feeling so right
pass it on!
give me the micâ€™, party man

make the funk
youâ€™ve gotta do it on your own
all alone
but I ainâ€™t going home, no, no
dancing on after midnight
partyman, hear me! oh

jamming on
after midnight
groovy song
dj gives and takes
right the wrongs 
with the beats and breaks, oh yeah

beauty flows 
it doesnâ€™t matter who you are
when youâ€™re there
youâ€™re feeling like a movie star
no surprise youâ€™re in sync now
