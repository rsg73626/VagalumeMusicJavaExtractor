WHO SAYS (THIS IS LOVE)

how come I feel so bad
and still Iâ€™m looking for tears?
the sun has been out all week
the weeks they all seem like years
still I would not undo
what I have done, because itâ€™s right

I wish Iâ€™d never learned
the things that I know today
but Iâ€™ve been touched and I
will never be the same
weâ€™re in a lonely spot
because we are saving our souls

and who says this is

who says this is love?
I say this is pain
we donâ€™t need to go on
fighting shame with shame
and if you hate me now
you donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m good
and that Iâ€™ve taken on
a lot more than I need

I did the dirty work
and now Iâ€™m using the gun
almighty universe!
I know my will will be done
Iâ€™m in a lonely spot
because I am saving my soul

and who says this is

so let there be pain
pumping through me
until I think I need to faint
- until I am someone

and who says this is love?
I say this is greed
you say youâ€™re good for me
but you donâ€™t know what I need
and if you hate me now
you donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m good
and that Iâ€™ve taken on
a lot more than I need

who says this is love?
I say this is pain
