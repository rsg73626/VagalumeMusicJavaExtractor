TALKIN' TALK

just let me have my flow!

talkin-talk is not just talk
being there is half the walk
if you wanna know yourself / stay with me
you gotta do the talkin¡¦ talk

I try to reach you
get right
down to the issue
we¡¦re not
happy with how it is today

sure, there are happy days and
good things to dwell upon but
when you are mad you walk away

you call me baby and I
just shrug my shoulders because there¡¦s
something important on my mind

don¡¦t wanna pick a fight but
we don¡¦t see eye to eye and
we really need to get things straight.

so what! if we disagree
don¡¦t wanna change you
I don¡¦t want you on your knees

are you afraid your loving
will fade away
whenever deep talk is released?

communication, baby,
that¡¦s what I claim today
it don¡¦t have to be bad

I wanna know your mind
and you to be into mine
so we can get ahead

can we talk?
