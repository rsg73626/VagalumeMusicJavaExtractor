SING MY NAME

sing my name 
sing my name out loud
- louder

you were the first one to hold me
first one who told me
not to be afraid of it

you were the first one to hold me
first one who told me
not to be ashamed of it

beautiful, intimate, unafraid
always
you and me 
on the same team weâ€™re gonna play again 

you were the first one to touch me
first one to match me
i am giving in to you 
you were the first one to touch me
first one to match me
not afraid of telling you

beautiful, intimate, unafraid
always
you and me 
on the same team weâ€™re gonna play again

give me recognition
give me confidence
what i thought was dirty 
is beautiful in your hands
