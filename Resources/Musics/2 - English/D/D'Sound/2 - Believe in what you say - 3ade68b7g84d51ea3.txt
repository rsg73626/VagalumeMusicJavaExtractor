BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU SAY

you give me many names
change my weary ways
this is why I call you &laquo;shine&raquo;

change the colour tone
re-arrange my home
taking over all my mind

the way you wear your smile
when youâ€™re unaware
makes me wanna squeeze you tight

why canâ€™t you believe
the way you get to me
do I have to sing all night?

believe in what you say
believe in what you do
you make me happy

why are you uptight?
why are are you so tense?
what are you afraid of doing?

trust me when I say:
everything is ok
- any kind of mood youâ€™re in

youâ€™re so beautiful
when youâ€™re kicking back
nobody could take your place

everything you feel
and everything you think
I can see it in your face
