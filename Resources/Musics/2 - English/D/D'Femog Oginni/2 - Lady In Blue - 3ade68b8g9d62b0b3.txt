LADY IN BLUE

You may wonder how come I've loved her
You may be thinking on how far I've missed her
You may wonder how come I've loved her
You may be thinking on how far I've missed her
People say why did you let her go
Let her go
My mama used to tell me always
I don't know why you 'd left me lonely
I tell you my son break away
Break away
Now I know that lady is gone
Lady in Blue is gone. (Chorus)
You may wonder how come I've loved her
You may be thinking on how far I've missed her
You may wonder how come I've loved her
You may be thinking on how far I've missed her
People say why did you let her go
Let her go
My friend says don't mind what they 're saying
We 've got our whole own lives to live on
Tomorrow might be a better day
Better day
