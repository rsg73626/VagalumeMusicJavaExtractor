STAY ALIVE

It's very long ago
I've been longing to play the role
Pretty time ago
I've been trying to find the road
But the road is long and it's getting tough
And I've got enough, with the loneliness of life

It's quite a long ago
I've been willing to search your soul
Pretty time ago
I've been trying to heal your sore
But the road is rough and it's getting tough
And I've got enough, with the sadness of my life

Stay alive and bring back our glorious time} chorus
We'll survive cos it's sad to let it fly
Bring it back, the joys of all the past
Stay alive and bring back the glorious time
There is much to say, there is life to live
so I beg you stay alive

The bright sky above
Turns to gray without your love
The deep blue sea below
Turns to brown without your love
But the road is rough and it's getting tough
And I've got enough with the loneliness of life

Stay alive and bring back our glorious time
We'll survive cos it's sad to let it go
Bring it back, the joys of all the past
Stay alive and bring back the glorious time
There is much to see, there is love to give
so I beg you stay alive
