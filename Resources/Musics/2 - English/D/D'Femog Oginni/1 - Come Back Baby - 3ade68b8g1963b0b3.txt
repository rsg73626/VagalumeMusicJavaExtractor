COME BACK BABY

Come back baby
Oh would you come back
Oh you' d better come back
And give me more loving

Come back baby
Oh would you come back baby
Oh you'd better come back mama
And give more kissin

I woke up this morning
Looking into mirror
But I can't see you out of that mirror
I laid down and mourning
Looking into your picture
But I ain't see you darling as a plan future

Come back baby
Oh would you come back
Oh you'd better come back mama
And give me more kissin

Come back baby
Oh would you come back
Oh you'd better come back darling
And give me more loving


Going in the street
Watching my sides baby
But I can't see you mama
Just at by my side

Going in the street
Watching my sides darling
But I can't see you mama
Just at by my side

Come back baby
Oh would you come back
Oh you'd better come back mama
And give me more loving
Together we stand up
As divided we fall down

I beg you hear my cry
Cos I don't wanna die
Together we stand up
As divided we fall down
I beg you here iam
Cos I don't wanna lie

Come back baby
Oh would you come back
Oh you'd better come back mama
And give me more loving

Come back baby
Oh would you come back
Oh you'd better come back darling
And give me more kissin
