MONSTER ROCK

You just walk on the streets of shame
You don't have any time to understand
Why do you use your black and white clothes?
No time for losers

You have no culture to discuss
Little world your life
Charles Boudelaire, what is this?
You don't have a future

You are a great illusion in your life
You think what you are, please don't tell me
You are dancing as a clown on the floor
Please don't make me laugh

You spin around, and around
Lost inside your mind
You are hearing voices, many voices
Stay in what you are
