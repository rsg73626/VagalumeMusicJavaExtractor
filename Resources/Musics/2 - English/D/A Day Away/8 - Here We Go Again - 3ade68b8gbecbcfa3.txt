HERE WE GO AGAIN

She's spinning you down
She's calling you out
From across the room
From across the room

And now you're making your move
And her body feels smooth
You trying to speak your mind
Hold out your tongue when you find that

Woah, and here we go again
And now she's leaving with the boy
That you thought was your friend
But friends don't do that

And now I'm lying on the floor
Broken, begging for one more chance
To make this right
One more chance
to fix the night and

And now she's breathing down my neck
And I hope she won't regret this choice
Regret this choice

Tomorrow night I'll be the same again
And you'll run off with your stupid friends
And you'll say, "I'm sorry"
And I'll say, "I told you so"

And don't let her,
Don't don't let her go
She's made mistakes
And now she'll let them know
Out the windows, down
But she's the queen of whores
So use the crown

Woah, and here she goes again
And now she's pulling up her skirt
To show a little skin
Good girls don't do that

And now I'm lying on the floor
Broken, begging for one more chance
To make this right
One more chance
to fix the night and

And now she's breathing down my neck
And I hope she won't regret this choice
Regret this choice

She's breaking me down tonight
(She's breaking, oh yeah, she's breaking it)
She's bringing down, down tonight

And now I'm lying on the floor
Broken, begging for one more chance
To make this right
One more chance

And now she's breathing down my neck
And I hope she won't regret this choice
Regret this choice

And now I'm lying on the floor
Broken, begging for one more chance
To make this right
One more chance
to fix the night and

And now she's breathing down my neck
And I hope she won't regret this choice
Regret this choice
