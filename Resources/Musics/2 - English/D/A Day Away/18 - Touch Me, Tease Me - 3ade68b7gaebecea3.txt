TOUCH ME, TEASE ME

Here's to the note she wrote 
We'll raise a bottle 
Oh, got drunk and made out with a model 
What the hell is going on tonight? 
It seems I'm stuck in game mode 
The settings are hit it and quit it 
Don't go home alone tonight 
Girl, you're alright, girl, by my side 
You weren't the best I've ever had 
You weren't the best I've ever had 

Were the boys with the cars that show off our scars
That get the girls that rock your world 
Don't you wish you knew what it was like to be me? 

Here's to the note she wrote 
We'll raise a finger 
Obscene gestures, so she said 
But I only said sweet things to get you in bed 
And she was touching, teasing me 
Her game was good, but I was playing easy 
See I had the will to leave it alone 
Though her words were mean she still escorted me home, and she said
You're with the best you'll ever have 
And I said, You're not the best I've ever had 

Cause we're the boys with guitars 
We're big rock stars 
Yeah, we'll steal your girl, and rock her world 
Don't you wish you knew what it was like to be me?
