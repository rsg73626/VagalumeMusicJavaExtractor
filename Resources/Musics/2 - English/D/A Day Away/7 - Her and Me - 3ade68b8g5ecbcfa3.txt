HER AND ME

It doesn't seem natural
It doesn't seem nothing for this
To happen like that
But we should choose running
Through unexpected crash
From what to come
Of this awkwardness
That you know
Well I don't know

[Bridge:]
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to move
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to loose control

[Chorus x2]
Then it was her and me
And me and her
And everything was fine
So I thought for sure,
Something's real wrong
On this lovely day

And this is said,
We're on to something
I got to call
But she's not buying
And how long will you be
And why could you scratch up me
And what to come
Of this awkwardness
That you know
Well I don't know

[Bridge:]
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to move
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to loose control

[Chorus x2]
Then it was her and me
And me and her
And everything was fine
So I thought for sure,
Something's real wrong
On this lovely day

And all we had was love
It's over
And all we had was love

[Chorus x3]
Then it was her and me
And me and her
And everything was fine
So I thought for sure,
Something's real wrong
On this lovely day
