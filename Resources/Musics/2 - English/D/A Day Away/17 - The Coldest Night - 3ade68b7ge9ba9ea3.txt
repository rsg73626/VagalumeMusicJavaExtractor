THE COLDEST NIGHT

Hey you, whatcha been up to? 
It's been about a week or two since 
I last talked to you, just wanna know what's going on. 
I'm chillin' in my room, killing time just thinking about you...and all those things that we've been through. 

The cold air's coming to take it's place. 
You see it coming, slow embrace. 

This is the coldest night of them all. 
The rain will freeze and snow will fall to the ground. 
I'm falling down and I'm stuck here for another day. 

I'm driving in my car around town, downtown. 
Hoping I might find you standing there. 
Like the star you are, all the guys are in their cars. 
They start to speak your name, it drives me insane 

I gave you everything and just walked out on me. 
I gave you everything. 

Goodbye with your eyes and their rolling... 

Too many times I'm right and your wrong. 
This time you were right and I was wrong.
