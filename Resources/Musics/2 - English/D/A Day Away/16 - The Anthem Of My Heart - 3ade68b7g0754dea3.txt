THE ANTHEM OF MY HEART

Is there a way to get around this?
The silence is tearing at my heart

You wanted to let it out,
but you just wouldn't allow yourself until right now 

And I'll take everything that I have
for everything you are
Let the world just slip away
and go back to where it starts

Just let it go. We're searching for the right time
to let all of the pieces fall in place

Is there a way to let all of this go? 
It's pulling me apart again

You wanted to let it out,
but you just wouldn't allow yourself until right now.

And I'll take everything that I have
for everything you are
Let the world just slip away
and go back to where it starts

This is the anthem of my heart

And I'll take everything that I have
for everything you are
Let the world just slip away
and go back to where it starts
