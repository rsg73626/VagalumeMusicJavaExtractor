ME AGAINST THE WORLD

Been here
Too fucking long
Watching it crumble as time goes on
Trying to patch up the pieces
Of my shattered life
I've tried before but it never seems to stick
When there's no order
Why should I live by it?
Took a stand
Once again held down
But I'll keep fighting till my body hit's the ground
OH YEAH
Feels like it's me against the world

Twenty years
Seemed like five
Still the same person still the same life
You made it so hard
For me to try
Now I'll spend the rest on the outside

Society threw me away
But that's okay I don't mind
Cause I know it's over now
Nothing left but this fight
Maybe someday you'll see
I'm never gonna do things your way No
You will never learn
Feels like it's me against the world

The hardest part is staying intact
How did I let it get
So fucking bad?
And I'll grow old and die still with the question
What was it all for cause there's no reculection
