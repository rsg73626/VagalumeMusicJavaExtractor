LIVING THIS LIE

Look at the burning
It's all lost to passivity
You may not make a change
But makes our fighting
More a reality
For those of you hiding
Don't believe what you see
Cause we don't know nothing
And it's time we got some answers
Right now
I said right now

I don't know how things got this way
I hate this lie
We've got to expose what stays so low
Not let them fuck with your mind
Some think that this will go away
Some still lie
Maybe we need to be cleaned
Just fucking wiped out
Can't trust ourselves
Anymore

I'm starting to give up
This grip holds so strong
It all comes down to money
Only left is greed
With our morals all gone

Bank accounts soar
Nothing to you has changed but we're just one step closer
To the end of our days, To the end of our days

The people that should run the world
Are locked away where no one sees them
How long can you fight the truth?
Cause if we don't fucking stand we're gonna carve tomb
So live inside just let it die
Who cares it's always been a matter of time
We never know how the story goes
We've never really seen we've just been controlled

Living this lie
Story of our lives
Keeping us safe
Overlooking the blaze

So many have suffered
Just trying to be heard
Threats are quickly dealt with
Their ideas are burned
Anything you want you gotta fight
There's always someone there
To tell you it's time
