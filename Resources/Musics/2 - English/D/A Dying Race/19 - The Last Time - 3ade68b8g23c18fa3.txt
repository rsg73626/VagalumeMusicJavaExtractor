THE LAST TIME

He goes to school today
Two black eyes and a
Broken arm
His drunken dad throws him one
As soon as he walks through the door
Trailer trash is what they all say
But he'll never be that way
That's the toughest thing to break
Parent's problems
Soon become your own

Every night he hides away
Trying to hide the anger trying to hide
His face
Abused his whole life
every time saying please
Please be the last time

This time might be
The last time I lose
The last time I bleed
Today, I cry
Not tomorrow, tomorrow I fight

I swear this is the last time

She was always
Hiding her face
Every night her dad made a
Mess of her face
Every night she asks herself
Why the fuck's this gotta be my life
Brings home a boyfriend
Dad rapes her
She'll never love again
She's on the highway now alone
Better than there better than home

How can they ruin a life like that?
Can you even look in the mirror?
On themselves now they depend
Now their life's built on fear
