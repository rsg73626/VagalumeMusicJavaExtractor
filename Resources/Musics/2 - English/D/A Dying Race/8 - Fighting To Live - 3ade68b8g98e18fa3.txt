FIGHTING TO LIVE

I need
I need a new beginning
My time
My time here is done
Everyday I'm in panic
I'm fighting for something more
I'm boiling over holding the lid tight

I don't care how many fights it takes cause I
I am gonna find a way
Wasted are so many minds today
Not mine
I am gonna find a way

My world
Seems so fucking small
And it seems just like
There's nobody home
My insight, my words
They insult the majority
Cause their lives are just a one book story

I don't know where the fuck I'm going
But I know I'll be clawing till my last breath
Ever thought about your situation hard
You took what they gave you and never looked back

I may tire but you'll never break me
I'll run circles around your lives
You say I'm nothing but someday you'll see
You'll strive for a look out of my eyes
And I don't want it
This linear track
Which you've so righteously bought tickets for
And my paths, got no heading
It's easy to find an end from the start.
