WE ARE THE FUTURE

You think I'm blind just a nothing with dreams
Follow my instincts and this you can't believe
This is my life but this you can't see
And your advice it don't mean shit to me
Your just pissed cause your chance is gone
You listened to the world but the world was wrong
But you stand by it like you started it all
Your minds controlled brainwashed all along

I'm so sick of these ideals
Sick of there faces telling me what to do
You stink of conformity
Why the fuck should I listen to you?
I'm sick of them spoon-feeding me
Lie after lie yeah
I won't let them tell me what to do
I'll take my stand now or I never will yeah

How can you be so afraid?
So afraid you try and hold me down
These ideals are extinct you know
Just like there generation
You just don't wanna see us exceed
And did you ever have intention?
Fuck no just another lie
Just a part of your lesson

And all this time goes by
As you reflect on your slowly wasting life
And you I'll never be
But I don't think you'll ever fucking learn
