DENIAL SOLVES NOTHING

I, I'm not blind
Cause I can see
The things you don't wanna believe
And if you thinking everything is fine
Your living in a dream
Cause you just don't wanna find
A way to make things right
Things die down easier
Than brought back to life

We're running out of time
It solves nothing to deny
CNN
That shit's all government screened
It's blinding the majority
But something's telling me we're fucked
We are never gonna see
Media distortion
Will deceive
What they show you
you believe
So go on living your perfect life
Inside you dream
