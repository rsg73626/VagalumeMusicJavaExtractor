NO ANSWER

No Answer
Questions, lies
Nothing's real anymore
As far I can see
Mistakes, cries
If we can't see we don't deserve to be
The human race
Is our worst plague
And what an irony
So watch us play
And what's more sick
We've got the remedy

I ask why?
I ask why do we cradle the wrong
Things I've heard prove more sick than stories
We build to destroy and it makes no sense

There's no answer
BUT I'LL TRY

What made us this way
Lost is any sense of morality
So watch us fade
Into a dark realm of this hatred

We can't find the answer
