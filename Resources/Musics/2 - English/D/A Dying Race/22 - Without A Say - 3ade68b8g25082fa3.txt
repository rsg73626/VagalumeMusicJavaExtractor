WITHOUT A SAY

The stacks on the horizon
Blow like a colored wind
Look at the waters beauty
It’s tainted by what we put in
Somehow we seem to look the other way
We’ll find out
Just how fast it goes
Just how fast it goes away

Right here right now
This place we live in
Why can’t ask ourselves
How long can this go on?
We play the game
But there’s no winner
And we’re all the pieces
Glued to the board without a say
Without a say what can be done?

We’re forced into compliance
The machine drives away
Our lasting need for excess
Makes us the dying ones today
Our greatest weakness
Is out lack of self control
And finding out
These wells go dry and
And we’re not invincible
