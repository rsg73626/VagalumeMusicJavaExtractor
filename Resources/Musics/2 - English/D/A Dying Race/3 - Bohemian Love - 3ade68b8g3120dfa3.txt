BOHEMIAN LOVE

I will not
Fucking listen to you, TO YOU!
I will not
Ever believe in you, IN YOU!
But this is what you want
This is what you want
But fuck you is what you'll get
So fuck the government!

Corruption
Happens every day, EVERYDAY
Watch as I
Burn your fucking flag, YOUR FLAG
Is this not enough
To make you see the truth
They don't care about you!

I am not
I am not drone
So many things
So many things unknown
