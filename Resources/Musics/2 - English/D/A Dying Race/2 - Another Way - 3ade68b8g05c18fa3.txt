ANOTHER WAY

Will somebody
Tell me what's gone wrong?
This world is fucked how much longer can we carry on?
But I've got no faith
It'll stay the same
You people run the world
So for all of this
It's you I blame

The bombs keep flying today
You know they're not that far away

What the hell is going on?

There's gotta be some sort of
Way out of this mess
Stopping the fighting will
Surely be our last test
But I've got no faith
It'll stay the same you people
Run the world so for all of this it's you I blame

And I don't wanna see
What the future holds for us
Ten thousand armies just ain't enough
You know we won't survive
Is it worth it to be alive?
Somebody please there's gotta be another way
