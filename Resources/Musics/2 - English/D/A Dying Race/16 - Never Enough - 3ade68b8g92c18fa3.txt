NEVER ENOUGH

I know why your going down
know you did this to yourself
That railway on your arm tells the story
It's not hard to figure it out

Well go ahead and stick another
In your arm
And keep telling yourself that there's no harm
Don't come back
It'll never be enough

It's easy to lie to yourself
Whatever makes you feel better man
So it goes you'll never pick yourself up
So it goes your gone

FUCK!!!!!
