FEW AND FAR BETWEEN

A long road to nowhere, seems like the only way. Sometimes the road less traveled seems just as long. And one day your sky will fall, but don't run, you'll find it so much better to tough it out. 

Stand your ground. Never back down. 

Time for the fight of your life, we'll see how much you can take. Some people just give in. Others just give up. 

To me, these are more then just words to live by, "Don't ever let anyone tell you what you can or can't do!" 

This is the ten count. 
I will never stay down. 
I will never lie down. 
I will never face down. 

One more round...
