FOREVER AMOR

Hey girl don't let this love just slip away
The feelings that I feel
For you will always stay this way
You turn my world around
And baby love is what you find
Only you and I will hold the hands of time
Just keep in mind the words
That I'm about to say to you
My heart will flow with ecstacy
For something that is true
Now don't turn your back away
I'll look you straight into your eyes
And let you know how much
I love you, this love will never die

Forever amor, ooh baby tonight's the night
I want you for myself
Forever amor, ooh baby tonight's the night
I want you for myself
Forever amor, together we will be
Boy I'm cryin' for your love
Forever amor, for all eternity
Te amo mi amor

Just wanna let you know
How much I love you in every special way
And I wanna tell you girl
How much you mean to me more than any way
This love is right for me boy
Can't you see it in my eyes
You captivated me with charm
With you I'm hypnotized
My heart belongs to you
And only you will hold the key
The key to our paradise forever you and me
Let's take our time for
What we have and baby you will learn
This special love I feel for you
Will never let you go
Sleep under the stars for emotion
And we're bound
Together we will fly away
Where lovers can't be found

You know that our love was meant to be
A special bond between us girl
Two hearts in harmony
I climb the highest mountain
Just to wish upon a star
To keep you here right by my side
No matter where you are
OOh the magic in your eyes
Has made me realize
That you're the only one
For me that keeps me so alive
Just listen to my heart
Always forever I'll be true
I need to know you love me boy
By saying I love you
