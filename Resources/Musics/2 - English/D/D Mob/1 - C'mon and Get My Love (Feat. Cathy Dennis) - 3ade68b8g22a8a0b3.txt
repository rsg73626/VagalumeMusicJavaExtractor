C'MON AND GET MY LOVE (FEAT. CATHY DENNIS)

C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
Break it down

So many times I've been around you
I don't know how much I like you
It's like a dream each time I see you
And there's this magic in the air

I feel so shy that I can't approach you
Even though you're just there
But I know that one day I'll get my way
And this is what I'll say

C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you

And in my dreams I am with you
And I dance with your silhouette
There are many times I've tried to squeeze you
In these dreams I won't forget

It seems so long we've been together
Since way back then
And only if you knew how much I loved you
You'd turn to me and say

Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight?
'cause I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you each
And every night

Let's just say our love is strong
Would you know where you belong?
Or would I have to show you and teach you?
Hold you and please you to show you
That you belong, belong

C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you

If there's been a time that I needed you
Then the time is now
I want to see you every hour
When I think I always hear you say

C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you

Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight?
'cause I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you each
And every night

Let's just say our love is strong
Would you know where you belong?
Or would I have to show you and teach you?
Hold you and please you to show you
That you belong, belong

C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
C'mon and, c'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
