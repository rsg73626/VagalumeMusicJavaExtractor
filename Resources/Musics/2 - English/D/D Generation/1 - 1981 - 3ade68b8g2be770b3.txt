1981

Stuck in the middle of 1981
Seek deviation I am hiding from the sun
Run from the poison, factories and graves
Spray paint heroes and middle class white slaves

Crypt, crashing, bruised and bashing
Crawling creep never go away
Shaved and sliding, scared and broken
Joking cause I am angry in all my days
Zombie teen insurgence, leather jacket smile
Black boots of combat, I am super juvenile
No nazi guises, no tracks up my sleeve
No corporate lies, no intention to deceive

Crypt, crashing, bruised and bashing
Crawling creep never go away
Shaved and sliding, scared and broken
Joking cause I am angry in all my days
Scars of the stories, smoking burning years
Don't break the circle, bleeding restless ears
Tanquaray and tonic, secret rebel truce
A worldwide playground to steal forbidden fruit

Crypt, crashing, bruised and bashing
Crawling creep never go away
Shaved and sliding, scared and broken
Joking cause I am angry in all my days
Crypt, crashing, bruised and bashing
Crawling creep never go away
Shaved and sliding, scared and broken
Joking cause I am angry in all my days
