AUTONOMY

Eyes glazed.
Cast away from reality.
No regards for the limits of speed.
Encompassing soliloquy.
Selfish is the center of thought.
Autonomy.
Can you thrive in your mind?
This journey of these fallen souls consumes us all.
This journey of these fallen souls consumes us.
Consumes us all.
I see pride in your eyes.
You see a way of life.
Your life consumes.
Eyes glazed.
Cast away from reality.
No regards for the limits of speed.
Encompassing soliloquy.
Selfish is the center of thought.
Autonomy.
