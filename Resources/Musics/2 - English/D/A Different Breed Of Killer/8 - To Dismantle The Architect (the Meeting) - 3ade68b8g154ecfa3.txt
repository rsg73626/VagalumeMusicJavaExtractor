TO DISMANTLE THE ARCHITECT (THE MEETING)

A fatal flaw in omniscient design.
No grasp of what stands before me yet I know him like a son.
This is perfection at its best.
His eyes know no fear and the ultimate truth.
A god of war who does not know his purpose.
A god of war.
A vessel for death.
Bred to end the bloodshed.
Not bred to be the apocalypse.
This pawn from the king of procreation was meant to wipe the board.
The last stand from the mightiest of nations has began to self-destruct.
His presence is overwhelming.
As much as I have feared this day.
I have longed for it to come.
We must tell him of the fate we desired, And help to make it end.
An act of regicide.
