SEARCHING FOR THE NEXT STAGE

I am searching for the portal
Roads with attitude kinds
Trace my course to next stage
To execute my mission

No!! God help me!
Obstacle avoid me to follow it
I donÂ´t know what to do
How can I do to go on??

Searching for the next stage...
Follow your heart!!!

But the mist confuses my mind
I think I do the right thing
It always turns against me
I realize I must have to change

I have already rebelled against everything
My heart has bleeded 
Until to dry all the blood drops
God, help me to change...how???

Searching for the next stage...
Follow your heart!!!

I am this creature
Searching for the next stage
Because we are really animals
Searching desperately for salvation
