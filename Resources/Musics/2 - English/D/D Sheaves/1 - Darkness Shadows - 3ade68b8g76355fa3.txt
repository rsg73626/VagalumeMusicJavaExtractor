DARKNESS SHADOWS

"They will be present forever"
Come along with me darkness shadows
You regenerate me
My morbid inspiration´s fountain 
It´s my black flower´s grave

Darkness Shadows

I claim you to be my protection
Throw down your sacred blood in my coffin
To give brightness to my darkness
So the death won´t be so painfull

Transmit me your knowledges Mr. Death
I wanna be your disciple, your son
A new master and to teach your tradiction
To those that earn it...the wises

Join your lonlyness with mine
And give me your fire kiss
Cause my throat is dry
And I need your life´s blood

Dad, Master, who I so much hate and love
I will do my eternal life
My devotion to your blood chalice
And it will be inevitable
