HOLDIN' IT DOWN FOR THE UNDERGROUND

Been through a lot this last year
Like everything I love is slipping away
And every time I come home
Somebody it isn't there
I got to get it together
I got to do things for myself
I've giving everything
Plus you take some from me
I need some room to breath

Come on come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
Come on come on
Tell me will be ok
(will be ok)
Let's go back let's go back
To a time where I
Still felt I had a family

This isn't what I remember
Everyone is looking
Out for just themselves
If need be I'll be happy to leave
I see straight through
That smile straight through
That painted face
Don't think I can't tell
Which one of you is against me

Come on come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
Come on come on
Tell me will be ok
(will be ok)
Lets go back lets go back
To a time where I
Still felt I had a family

I am the greatest thing that falls
I turn my back and out came the wolves

Pay attention!!!!

Come on come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
Come on come on
Tell me will be ok
(will be ok)
Lets go back lets go back
To a time where I
Still felt I had a family

Been through a lot this last year
Like everything I love is slipping away
