BULLFIGHT

What a waste, I see you now and then
But mostly we pretend
We're not more strangers than we're friends
Then we say, what we need to say
To try and get away from the tension we create

Why can't we say the things
the things we wish we would
Why can't we laugh the way
the way we know we should
Fall under the weight
of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness

I get
I get
I get so misunderstood

Somethin changed the way we interact
Now we can't get it back
Another relic of the past
Makes ya think, did I ever know you at all?
Follow until I fall
Vultures circling in the sun

Why can't we say the things
the things we wish we would
Why can't we laugh the way
the way we know we should
Fall under the weight
of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness

I get
I get
I get so misunderstood

You can't just avoid the issue
Ya shoulda learned from the things we've been through
You don't know what you have until it's lost
Till the hammer drops

Brace, fall

Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness

I get
I get
I get so misunderstood
