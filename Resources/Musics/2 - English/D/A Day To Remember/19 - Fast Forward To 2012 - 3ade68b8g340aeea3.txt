FAST FORWARD TO 2012

We welcome you to the second chapter
Thanks for turning the other page
We acknowledge you as the only reason for the progress that we've made
You're our constant reminder
We keep what we've conquered
Everything has gone so far
From where we were before
Well keep this short and sweet so I'll, Get to the point!

My friends come first
That's a part of life
My friends come first
That's a part of life
My friends come first
That's a part of life
My friends come first
That's a part of life

That's a part of life
They've said the futures never getting older
Well the tables do turn
Where will you be?

Pick up your feet!
