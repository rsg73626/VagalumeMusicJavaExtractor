YOU BE TAILS, I'LL BE SONIC

I'm a mess, that's the best to describe it.
Having no time to myself's the only way i can fight it.
When I'm alone, it's like I'm staring into a mirror.
Don't know the person inside and that's never been any clearer.
I miss your family and I miss all our friends,
if you had a "to do over", would you do it over again? 
Cause I would.
This meant something to me,
there's a hole in my heart where you used to be.

I still wish you the best of luck baby,
and don't go thinking this was a waste of time.
I couldn't forget you if I tried.
You killed what was left of the good in me.
I'm tired, so let me be broken.
Look down at the mess that's in front of me.
No other words need be spoken.
I've got nobody else to blame though I tried.
Kept all our past mistakes held inside,
I'll live with regret for my whole life.

I confess, I brought this all on myself.
Condemned to suffer alone like there's nobody else.
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me's missing,
so I'll keep living the lie,
and just hope that you're listening.

I tried to make us a life here,
but our foundation was built on sand.
No time to run until the damage was done.
I never had the upperhand.

I still wish you the best of luck baby,
and don't go thinking this was a waste of time.
I couldn't forget you if I tried.
You killed what was left of the good in me.
I'm tired, so let me be broken.
Look down at the mess that's in front of me.
No other words need be spoken.
I've got nobody else to blame though I tried.
Kept all our past mistakes held inside,
I'll live with regret for my whole life.

All the things you love are all the things I hate.
How did we get here in the first place?

I play it cool, but it's hard to be.
All my trust is slowly fading inside of me. Over what?
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate.
Only thing that can heal this is time and space.

I still wish you the best of luck baby,
and don't go thinking this was a waste of time.
I couldn't forget you if I tried.
You killed what was left of the good in me.
I'm tired, so let me be broken.
Look down at the mess that's in front of me.
No other words need be spoken.
I've got nobody else to blame though I tried.
Kept all our past mistakes held inside,
I'll live with regret for my whole life.

For my whole life.!
