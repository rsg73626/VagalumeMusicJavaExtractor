NO CIGAR

Tell us where you're from
what you want to become. And we'll say if you're OK

Where did you go to school?
Right answer and you're cool, yeah
you're the kid the wholeday

You get a sticker in your face
Information about the case, so you know your potential

Don't you think you can extend
Don't you think you can extend, just comprehend

But I don't wanna hear it, no, it's more than I accept

'Cause I don't care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
I will ignore

We will shut you out
We'll put you in doubt if you think that you're special
We'll tell you who you are
Tell you that you're close but no cigar

But, I don't wanna hear it, no, it's more than I accept

'Cause I don't care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
And I won't waste my time fitting in
'Cause I don't think contrast is a sin

What they say is
Go back where you came from
They'll tell you that but I don't wanna hear
No, I don't wanna hear. No, I don't wanna hear it
No, it's more than I accept

'Cause I don't care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
And I won't waste my time fitting in
'Cause I don't think contrast is a sin
No, it's not a sin
