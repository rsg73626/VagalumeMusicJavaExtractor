YOU HAD ME AT HELLO

I'm missing you so much, 
I'll see you die tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know the signs are on and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn 
I'd never trust anyone again 
But I didn't have to

You had me at hello.

I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I feel more with everyday that goes by
I watch the clock so I can make my timing just right

Would it be okay?
Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you.

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn 
I'd never trust anyone again 
But I didn't have to

You had me at hello

You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, 
You had me at hello
