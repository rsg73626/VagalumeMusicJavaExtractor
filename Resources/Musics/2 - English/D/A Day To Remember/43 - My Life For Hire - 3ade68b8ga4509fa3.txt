MY LIFE FOR HIRE

Somebody give a sign, that everything's going as
planned.
And that everything falls away,
into the darkness of this shallow place.

The detail is striking.
The room's cold and foggy.
You'll kick and you'll scream, you'll try everything
to survive.
But you should know your fate by now.

They told me, how I should be.
BUT I BROKE THE MOLD SOMEHOW !

Too vague, Too vague, you can't try to resolve the past
right now.
But I swear I'll be the one,
To let the world know what you've done to me

You, you know you gotta' search yourself
leave what you need for now.
It's not the time or place you're searching for.

All I can give is my worst of intentions.
You're nothing to me, you don't like what you see
but your life's a lie.
There's no where left to hide.

They told me, how I should be.
BUT I BROKE THE MOLD SOMEHOW !

Too vague, Too vague, you can't try to resolve the past
right now.
But I swear I'll be the one,
To let the world know what you've done to me
Too vague, Too vague, you can't try to resolve the past
right now.
But I swear I'll be the one,
To let the world know what you've done to me

Watch your back, you'll lose yourself.
This is a battleground!
When will they know?

Your life's a lie...

Too vague, Too vague, you can't try to resolve the past
right now.
But I swear I'll be the one,
the one to remember what you've done
(somebody give me a sign!)
Too vague, Too vague, you can't try to resolve the past
right now.
But I swear I'll be the one,
the one to remember what you've done.. to me.

They told me, how I should be.
BUT I BROKE THE MOLD SOMEHOW !
