IF I LEAVE

Let's go!

In the beginning I was up front
Nothing to think about, you’d always hear me out
We made a pact and never gave up
When everything would change, we always stayed the same
But something went wrong along the way
You come around and there’s nothing left to say
It's like we’re strangers anyway, what more could you ask of me

It’s been a long time coming
But everyone's gonna hear me now

If I leave, bet you’ll wish I’d stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can’t help us now,
If I leave this, if I leave this way.

I’ve always been a man of action,
Never let anything keep a hold of me
Can always tell when something's missing,
Like I know everything except for you and me
I can’t make you want to stay, 
God knows I tried but this broke under our weight
I still gave it everything, 
I guess I never catch my break

It’s been a long time coming
But everyone's gonna hear me now

If I leave, bet you’ll wish I’d stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can’t help us now,
You know that time can’t help us now, 
If I leave I'll still move away, 
And try to right all the wrongs we’ve ever made
Won't let your problems weigh me down
If I leave this, if I leave this way.

I never thought you’d be the last one standing
I never thought that we would come this far
You’ll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are

I never thought you’d be the last one standing
I never thought that we would come this far
You’ll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are

If I leave, bet you’ll wish I’d stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can’t help us now,
You know that time can’t help us now, 
If I leave I'll still move away, 
And try to right all the wrongs we’ve ever made
Won't let your problems weigh me down
If I leave this, if I leave this way.

I never thought you’d be the last one standing
I never thought that we would come this far
You’ll always be there looking over my shoulder
If I leave this, if I leave this way
