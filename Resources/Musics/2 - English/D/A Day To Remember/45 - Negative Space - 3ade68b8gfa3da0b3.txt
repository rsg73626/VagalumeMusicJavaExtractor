NEGATIVE SPACE

These walls, this house
Wasn't the plan when I built it out
We fell, from great heights
Disgusted looks in my neighbors' eyes

You reflect me in my negative space
Please forgive me for the time you'll waste
If you let me I'll give you a taste

Everyone eventually lets you down

Your heart, my lungs
In unison when I bite my tongue
Escape, at long last
Burn the bridge never looking back

You reflect me in my negative space
Please forgive me for the time you'll waste
If you let me I'll give you a taste

Everyone eventually lets you down

I don't care
I don't care
About what you think
About what you think

I won't hear
I won't hear
Anything you say
Anything you say

You reflect me in my negative space
Please forgive me for the time you'll waste
If you let me I'll give you a taste

Everyone eventually lets you down
