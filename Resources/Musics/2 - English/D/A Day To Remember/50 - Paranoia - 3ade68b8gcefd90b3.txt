PARANOIA

Expect the worst of everyone I meet
Count the clock cause I can't fucking sleep
Soon you'll pay like a heart attack
Call my friends I might not make it back

The doctor says I'm heading for destruction
Somethings gotta give
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgment
And no matter what you do about it
I'm still in your head

I stop and stare scared of the unknown
Unknown numbers been blowing up my phone
I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someones trying to take me out

The doctor says I'm heading for destruction
Can I fucking live
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgment
And no matter what you do about it
I'm still in your head

I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head
I am your breaking point

You can't run, you can't hide
I'll be there when you close your eyes at night
I'm always watching you

The doctor says I'm heading for destruction
My time is wearing thin
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgment
And no matter what you do about it
I'm still in your head
