STICK & BRICKS

I am fueled by all forms of failure
I paid the price
So, I'll take what's mine!

Bet ya didn't see that one comin'
Cause I do as I please
And apologize for nothing.
My time is flying
But I'm still second to none.
Always shining the brightest
When I'm placed under the gun.
So here I stand,
The only son of a working class man
I won't be held back
I can't be held down

Where were you
When my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide
You stood close by
And didn't make a sound!

(Say something!)

Find you some paper
And I'll go grab you a pen
You can start taking notes
On how this all started again.
Been dead last but found my way to the front
With my inspirational quotes on why
I never gave up!

Where were you
When my walls came falling down?(They came falling down)
You tried to hide
You stood close by
And didn't make a sound!

Where were you
When it all came back around? (It comes back around)
The reasons why you passed me by
Will always hold you down.

(Say something!)

If you can't stand the pressure
Stay the fuck out of my way!
I know my place!
This one goes out to everyone
Who's lied to my face!
MY HEART IS FILLED WITH HATE!

I'm making a difference,
I'm taking a chance.
You can say what you want about me
But no one can tell me I can't!

Where were you
When my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide
You stood close by
And didn't make a sound!

Where were you
When it all came back around? (It comes back around)
The reasons why you passed me by
Will always hold you down.

SAY SOMETHING!!
