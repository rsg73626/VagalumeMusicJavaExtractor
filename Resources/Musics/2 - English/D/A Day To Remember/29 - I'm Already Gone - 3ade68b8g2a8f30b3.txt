I'M ALREADY GONE

As I look round this make shift moving house
I'm searching for whatever's left of me
It's on the ground in a box thas reads lost and found
It's lost and found

She said, just let it go
She said, its all you've ever known

I'm already gone
I'm already somethin to someone that I don't know
When will I Know?
I'm out makin rounds every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

I've worked it out you'll always bring me down
From here on out I'm doing things for me
I'm impatient now
I'm not the type for life alone, I need someone

She said, just let it go
She said, its all you've ever known
I'm already gone
I'm already somethin to someone that I don't know
When will I Know?
I'm out makin rounds every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

With everything that sets me back
I push back harder to clear the way
There's not a thing that I regret
Can't live my life in yesterday

Live in yesterday

I'm already gone
I'm already somethin to someone that I don't know
When will I Know?
I'm out makin rounds every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home
