A SHOT IN THE DARK

lets take them back to the days
when we were family
my breath was your breath when we were young
i think it's funny how the times have changed
throw being jealous in the mix
and now all i know of you is a name
couldn't have came at a better time
this ends right now

we gave all of ourselves
to entertain you
were only hurting us (ourselves)

i'm a god amongst the ants and your girlfriends
and you act like you don't even know
it's cause you haven't been here for too long
i called this right from the start
i turn my back for one second now all i hear is a shot in the dark
use my name like you know me
you're all the same

keep running your mouth

mark my words were taking over the world
