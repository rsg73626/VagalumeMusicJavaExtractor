START THE SHOOTING

Hey boys, look where we are
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
So get ready to run
This all goes to show
Just how little you really know
About the way that we are

I notice everything
Like every single rumor
That you spread today
You're never gonna change
Let's set this record straight
I know all your dirty secrets
That you kept from me
This conversation's over

Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud

You're all the same
You think that everyone around you cares about what you think
No one knows your name
It's about that time 
Take everyone you know and get as far across my states line as you possibly can

I notice everything
Like every single rumor
That you spread today
You're never gonna change
Let's set this record straight
I know all your dirty secrets
That you kept from me
This conversation's over

Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud

Will they miss me when I'm gone?
Will this time be for too long?
Wait till then
And see if time brings change
Will they miss me when I'm gone?
Will this time be for too long?
Wait till then
And see if time brings change

(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Watch your step
(Watch your step)
This town can chew you up 
And spit you out
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud

(Watch your step)
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
(Watch your step)
So pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
(Watch your step)
(Watch your step)
