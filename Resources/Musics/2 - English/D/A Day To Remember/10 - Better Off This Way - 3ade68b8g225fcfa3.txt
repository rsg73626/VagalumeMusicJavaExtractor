BETTER OFF THIS WAY

I wonder if you'll notice, if they lock me up and throw away the key
Gotta be open minded, you've got a lot to learn in the ways of me
You've always got to say something,
I'm none of your concern but you won't listen at all
you know I'd rather say nothing, and just be proud of myself
I'm tearing down these walls.

When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I've found a better way
To help keep you from me, I'm better off this way

Wo-oh-oh (2x)
I'm better off this way
Wo-oh-oh (2x)

You gotta keep this coming, tell me like you know it
But you don't know nothing, your call.
We can settle this like gentlemen, or meet me at the back
To end it all inside again.

My whole life's been waiting, ever since I can remember
Been anxious awaiting your fall, and don't let me be a long while
Can't let go of my life till I know you're done.

When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I've found a better way
To help keep you from me, I'm better off this way

Wo-oh-oh (2x)
I'm better off this way
Wo-oh-oh (2x)

You Want It, You've got It
You've always been such a waste of time
You Want It, You've got It
A friend of your's is no friend of mine
You Want It, You've got It
When will you act your age?
You Want It, You've got It
You're the reason things have to change
Wo-oh (2x)
You're the reason things have to change
Wo-oh (2x)

When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I've found a better way
To help keep you from me, I'm better off this way
Wo-oh (2x)
I'm better off this way
Wo-oh (2x)

I'm better off this way...
