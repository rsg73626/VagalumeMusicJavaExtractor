HEARTLESS

For once my eyes are open to you, 
And everything you've said.
For once your web of lies is in the open.
I gave you everything I had, until I had nothing left.
Now you act as if I'm just a burden.
I've finally let go.

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.
'cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, 
And now its time to choose.

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life.
I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken.
Don't threaten me with what you think I feel.
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears.
I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me.

I've finally come to terms with what I am.
I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change. 
I'm living in a dream.

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.
I'm done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, 
And now its time to choose.

And i'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time
When I'm finally past this and happy on my own.
I've done all I can, and i've still been cast aside.
All I ever wanted to be was be the one 
Who would wipe those tears from your eyes.
But I guess i'll play second best, 
To a world that will never care about you.

When will you understand to them you're just another pretty face?
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him.
I can hear your words of treason from a mile away.

You never did know how to whisper.
You fuckin liar. Tell me the truth.
Do the world a favor stop cutting your arms,
And slit your throat
