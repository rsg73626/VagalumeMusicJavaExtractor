THE DANGER IN STARTING A FIRE

so now you'll know exactly what it feels like
to be an obstacle in my way
you won't remain
you won't remain

save your breath don't even speak
if you'll speak of change
cause you wont
you won't
cut to the chase
spare the lecture on what it takes to make a man
cause you're weak and i'm strong

i will never falter
i'll stand my ground
you're a fake, a worthless coward
you'll life wont mean anything

lets set things straight
what's done is done
i never needed you
tell me exactly who you think that you're kidding?
everyone will be happy when they find that you're missing
you asked if we'd ever forget you
we've got our fingers crossed
our fingers crossed

that's the danger in starting a fire
you'll never know how many bridges you'll burn
