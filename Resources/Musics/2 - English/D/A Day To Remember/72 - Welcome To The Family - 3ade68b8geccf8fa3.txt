WELCOME TO THE FAMILY

We're finally home at last
I've waited for this day to come
There's just something about you that rubs me wrong
You're not worth my attention
I built this with my own two hands
If you could sever the ties and stop using me as your
next misconception

Chorus: X2
I don't believe that everything you've known about me
is gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent forever, it
haunts me

It won't be long before you meet your end
You're nothing more than a passing frame
So keep those cameras rolling
You think I wouldn't remember?
You're just another whisper in myself
You can spare me the lies
You don't believe in me
Your life's a contradiction

Chorus: X2
I don't believe that everything you've known about is
gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent forever, it
haunts me

Move!!!!!!

Chorus: X2
I don't believe that everything you've known about is
gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent together, it
haunts me.
