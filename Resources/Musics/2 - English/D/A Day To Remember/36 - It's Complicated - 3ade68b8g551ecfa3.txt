IT'S COMPLICATED

Here we go again, another night of being bummed
I keep to myself, avoid society
And cancel plans with everyone
I know cause its just how it always ends
Our bond will break cause you can't relate
To anyone, to anything at all

You brought your worst and I'm right here
Now I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things straight cause
everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Lets try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

You still know me
Still not cut out for this sort of thing
Never want to be, caught in between
I need constant reminders of everything
So what! It's who I am, but I think I played it off so well
I just hold it in
no matter how I've been, so nobody, nobody can tell

You brought your worst and I'm right here
Now I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things straight cause
everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Lets try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

I won't sleep till the break of dawn
(Break of dawn!)
I cant let our problems find me here
So everybody come on!

You brought your worst and I'm right here
Now I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things straight cause
everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Lets try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things straight cause
everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Lets try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them
