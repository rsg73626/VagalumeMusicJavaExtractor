2ND SUCKS

Fight!

You're afraid like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years,
But couldn't reach the next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see

Is anybody else listening?
Out of sight, out of mind is what you'll always be
I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you

I speak the truth, and everybody else knows it
So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you
So keep wishing you were me,
And I'll keep making you have to

Is anybody else listening?
Out of sight, out of mind is what you'll always be
I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you

I just can't believe it's really come to this
Because without me, you would not exist

Alright
(Hey, hey)
Still got something left to say
Only one in the world I depend on is me
I need nothing from no one, I take what I need
Get a hold of yourself and keep away from me

Is anybody else listening?
Out of sight, out of mind is what you'll always be
I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you
