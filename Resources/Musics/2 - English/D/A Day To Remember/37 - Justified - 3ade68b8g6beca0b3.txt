JUSTIFIED

Burn me alive. If you feel that's justified
I need more than faith, to see you on the other side
Can you hear me? The lowly one
Do you fear me? You righteous ones

Bow down to whole earth's creation
Every man of every nation
Who's right and wrong at times like these?

Burn me alive. If you feel that's justified
I need more than faith, to see you on the other side
Can you hear me? The lowly one
Do you fear me? You righteous ones

I believe in a life before death
That happiness and virtue coexist
And if you only believe to hedge the bet
You're gonna pay your debt!

Burn me alive. If you feel that's justified
I need more than faith, to see you on the other side
The lowly ones, need more than this
To see you on the other side, the other side

Burn me alive. Feel nothing, leave nothing, learn nothing
Then be on your way, be on your way

Do you fear me? You righteous ones
Can you hear me? The lowly one, the lowly ones
