FORGIVE AND FORGET

I feel like a runaway
Seeing the light of day for the first time
I'm drawing the line

It's hard to care when you know it all
In slow motion I watch you fall
Like you're blind, thoughts poison the mind
I always bend when it comes to you
I think you'll change, but you never do
You never do, I enable you
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shot me out, shot me out
Forgive and forget, forgive and forget (whoa-whoa)
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shot me out, shot me out
Forgive and forget, forgive and forget (whoa-whoa)

Wish that I could say this to your face
Something different, something brave
Wish I would, but I never could
I feel you slowly pulling me in
I try to help, but it's sink or swim
And you're a weight, there's comfort in pain

Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shot me out, shot me out
Forgive and forget, forgive and forget (whoa-whoa)
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shot me out, shot me out
Forgive and forget, forgive and forget (whoa-whoa)

You've drained all the love I had
All I had for you
You've drained all the love I had
All I had for you
All I had for you

Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shot me out, shot me out
Forgive and forget, forgive and forget (whoa-whoa)
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shot me out, shot me out
Forgive and forget, forgive and forget (whoa-whoa)
