HOMESICK

Everything around me seems so much different than where I'm from
And at this rate I think that my fate's been sealed
This life's so unpredectible,
we'll go continue to live a life that no one knows.
Where's this gonna go?
Right here right now, this is the beginning of the end,
and I won't sing one single thing till we can get this right.
we're moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs,
and tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose we made our moves,
and now we gotta go, go.

Everything about me seemed so much different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place, five years have passed,
good god have I been gone?
So wide that I've never felt more alone in my whole life.
Time's not on my side,
Right here right now, this is the beginning of the end,
and I Won't sing one single thing till we can get this right.
We're moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs
and tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose we made our moves
and now we gotta go, go.

So why does this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
So why does this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward but were not there yet
I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward but were not there yet
I'm holding onto a fairytale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs
and tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose we made our moves
and now we gotta go, go.

So why does this make me so nervous?
(you make me so)
Why does everything go wrong?
So why does this make me so nervous?
(you make me so)
Why does everything go wrong?
