END OF ME

I took some time away
For understanding of what brought us here today
Oh, you'll be the end of me

I'm never happy like we were happy
I'm never sad like we were sad
Oh, you'll be the end of me

You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see

Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
Oh, you'll be the end of me

I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
Till I forgot why I stayed
Oh, you'll be the end of me

Yeah we lost all meaning
We lost the magic
So good luck to you on your way
Oh, you'll be the end of me

Ya know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see

Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
Oh, you'll be the end of me
You'll be the end of me

I get it, no, I get it
Gave more than I took back, oh well (so back away!)
I get it, no, I get it
Can't help those who don't wanna be helped

Ya know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gonna and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see

Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
Oh, you'll be the end of me
The end of me
