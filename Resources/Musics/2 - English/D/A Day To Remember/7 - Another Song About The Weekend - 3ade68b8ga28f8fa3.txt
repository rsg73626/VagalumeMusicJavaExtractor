ANOTHER SONG ABOUT THE WEEKEND

They keep playing sad songs on the radio
And I feel like I'm so alone
On this 15 hour drive
And all the while I tell myself to just believe
'Cause nobody can give so much
And never get anything
(Never get anything)

Everyone I used to know
say they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
not much has changed
I still know where I came from

I fell asleep with the lights on
I can see your the first one in a long time.
That had some faith in me
(Have faith in me)
tell my friends we wont be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
It feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me.

In all the while I say too much of what I think
And I can't remember what it's like to find meaning
--in anything for the life of me
Everyone I use to know
say they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
not much has changed
I still know where I came from

all I've ever wanted was so far from what I need
I'll write my songs, they'll sing along, and hope time 
heals everything

I fell asleep with the lights on
I can see your the first one in a long time.
That had some faith in me
(Have faith in me)
I tell my friends we wont be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
and it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me.

This is all I have! 
This is all I have! 
It's my life
This is all I have! 
This is all I have! 

I fell asleep with the lights on
I can see your the first one in a long time.
That had some faith in me
(Had faith in me)
I tell my friends we won't be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
It feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me.
