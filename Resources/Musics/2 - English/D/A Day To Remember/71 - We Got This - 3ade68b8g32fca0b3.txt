WE GOT THIS

[Chorus]
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend
that help me up from down
We got this

[Verse 1]
You're just like me when I was your age
We all knew better, name it, we've been there
When I had a place that I could call my own
we spent most days counting the ways
we would get through it
But they said we were stupid
now all those kids say they knew us so well
Come on get real
[Chorus]
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend
that help me up from down
We got this

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid of anything
Here's to the future
It was nice that I knew ya
Go find something that makes you feel complete
'Till the next time we meet

[Chorus]
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend
that help me up from down
We got this

[Bridge]
You're just like me
Things do get better
Trust me I've been there
You're just like me
Things do get better
Trust me I've been there
You're just like me
Things do get better
Trust me I've been there
You're just like me
Things do get better
Trust me I've been there

[Chorus]
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend
that help me up from down
We got this
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend
that help me up from down
We got this
Yeah we got this
