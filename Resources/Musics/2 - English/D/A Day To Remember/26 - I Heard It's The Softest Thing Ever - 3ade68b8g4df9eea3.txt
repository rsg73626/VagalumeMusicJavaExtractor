I HEARD IT'S THE SOFTEST THING EVER

Tonight I'm sending you a message
This is the end of an era
The end of second chances
In the face of defeat
I'm winning
Yet you still have so much left to say

Oh they're coming straight for me
Oh they're coming straight for me
Read between the lines
We can't give in this time
Just let me go for now i'll be just fine
Don't ya know don't ya know
Now that I'm back on my own

Tell me how it feels
To watch the walls of your security crumble
I remember you
You took the easy way out 
When I gave you something to stand for

I was just another promise you couldn't keep
