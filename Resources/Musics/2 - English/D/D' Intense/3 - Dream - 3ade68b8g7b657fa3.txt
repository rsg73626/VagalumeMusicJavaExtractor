DREAM

Well I had a dream just the other night
Where black was red and red was white
No one cared about the color
Or whoever one a useless fight
Different tone on everyone's lips

Written on the face of every man alive
Follow me, and I'll set you free [x4]
Everybody lives, because nobody dies
Was once a few words from one man
Is now a revelation for all mankind
Cause no one cries, no one eats
No one loses any sleep now
No one shares a single thought that's wrong all day long
Follow me, and I'll set you free [x4]
Well I had a dream just the other night

Nobody cared, hey, beat it
What's your hurry?
Nobody had to see through eyes
Nobody felt the need to lie
Evil and good came together and became the same, under one name
Follow me, and I'll set you free...
