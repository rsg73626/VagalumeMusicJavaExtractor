MY VOICE

im drowning in pain
the pain of my blood
of cutting
of not cryng
a memory is what i got
from a happy day
a glass broken on the floor
is what i need to be okay
as a friend
grab my hand
kill me with no pain
cuz thats the only thing i fear
another day
another brethless day

chours
im so stupid
so fucking dumme
where the heal is that fuckig gun???
i listen to theyre voice
i dont care what they´re talking
i´m crazy
i like pain
im crawling
beging to die
my voice is heard on heaven


maybe tomorow i´ll be fine
tomorow i´ll be fine
give me a reason to live
a reason to live
