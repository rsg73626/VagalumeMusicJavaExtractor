FATSO NERO

Put on your sheets and wreaths...
follow in the footsteps of Caligula.
Study the logic of Fatso Nero...
wine, women and song.
'Cuz it's a modern day...
Roman empire.

Where girls hone all the boys,
diseases passed around like a game of...
TAG--and now you're in it!
[Chorus:]
It's a modern day Romanhood.

You're not the first to be no good.
You'll never know what kind of life it is.
Eating sweet and plenty grapes,
bonin' down on a bitch.
Praying to the Gods,
in the sluaghterhouse of Athens.
If mom saw you smoking pot,
she'd throw you to the lions...NERO!
Die...you've got it!
