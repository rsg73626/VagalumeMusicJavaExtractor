I STILL LUV U BABY

in 1000 ways you broke my heart 
do you know how it feels to be broken apart? 
my love ain´t gone 
guess i´ll carry on without you 

CHORUS

everytime im all alone i think of you 
of your smille the way you dance 
i still love you baby 
guess i have to move on without you 
what am i to do without you? 
I still luv u baby

tellme now that you always knew 
that there was something 
a strong feeling 
but i don´t feel save when i think my love wont fade away 

CHORUS

in my world is rainning without you 
these wounds wont heal 
without your kiss 

i pray to god 
one day you love me like i do 

CHORUS
