PARANOIDS DEMISE

Bye bye bavy, don't you cry
Oh, oh
Time to leave, still you wonder why
Oh, oh
It's not like I'm running away
So little time, time, so much to say
Bye bye baby, it's alright
Oh, oh
Hope you don't lose your sleep tonight
Oh, oh
I'll be back, so it's okay
So little time, time so...
(Chorus)
Bye bye babe-Now we're on our way
Leaving today-Our crimes and you pay
We're on our way-Despising our ways
So little time, so much to say
Bye babe-Despising our ways
We're on our way-Our crimes and you pay
Leaving today-Now we're on our way
So little time! So much to say!
Our bags packed, we're hittin the road
Oh, oh
We're gonna miss you, but I gotta go
Oh, oh
There's no time for long goodbys
End of the world, see it in your eyes
Look ahead, you can't look back
Oh, oh
I need you so, but it's time to attack
Oh, oh
We'll be back, so it's okay
So little time, so...
(Repeat chorus twice)
Crowds explode like a nuclear bomb
Little time, lots to say
Meeting people 'round the world
Then we're on our way
When we met, I told you someday
I'd have to be on my way
I need you so, but I have to go
No I'm on my way
