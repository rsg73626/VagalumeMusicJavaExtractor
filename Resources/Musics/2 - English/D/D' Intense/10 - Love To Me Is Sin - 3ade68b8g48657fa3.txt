LOVE TO ME IS SIN

Hey baby won't you give me away
Friedns tell me you're an easy lay
Don't fight back bitch, 'cuz you know I'm gonna win
It's cold outside, so let me in
So you think you're gonna get away
I just got one thing to say
Gonna like what I give you, gonna like it bad
Don't like what I give you, gonna make me mad
[Chorus]
Adam and his apple
Billy and his Gin
Love to me is sin
Poor little gutter girl all alone
Wandering the streets without a home
She'll sleep in the street
She'll sleep in the trash
Anything for a little cash
Easy to find,
Just follow the stench
On the ground, or on a park bench
At the show she'll sleaze around
She is the smelliest bitch in town
[Repeat chorus]
I had a dream, I was this big
I crawled into your ned
And did a little jig
I played it cool, I made a wish
And I woke up
My whole body smelled like fish...fish!
[Repeat first verse and chorus]
I had a dream, I grew in size
I was smashing people
Just like they were flies
I played it cool, I made a wish
And when I woke up
My whole body smelled like fish...fish!
