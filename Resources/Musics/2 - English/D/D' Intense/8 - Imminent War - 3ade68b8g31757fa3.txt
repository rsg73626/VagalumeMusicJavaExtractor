IMMINENT WAR

What is this world trying to do to me
Sometimes I gotta find a way out
Just like an animal trapped in a cage
About to explode, got to get out
Imminent war, time to see the light
Imminent war, it's me or my friend that's gonna fight
One of these things is gonna come back and kill you
You just listen to the bomber's purr
Well I think it stands for murder

Imminent war, time to see the moonlight
Imminent war, it's me or my friend
That's gonna die in the long run

You know it

Imminent war... we told you so
Imminent war, time to see the moonlight
Imminent war, it's you my friend that's gonna bite
Imminent war
