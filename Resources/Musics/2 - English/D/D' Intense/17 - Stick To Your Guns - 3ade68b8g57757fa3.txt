STICK TO YOUR GUNS

Time to fight it's time to unite
Hope you know the sytem I know you've heard it before
Sounds so pretty on your military table
We're ready to fight man and I know we're able
Think about the future and I know we're on top
We're not gonna stop cuz I know that I'm gonna have me some fun
Gotta stick to your guns
You can feel the energy being sucked from me
I can take it it won't destroy me
You gotta think man your life's begun
Don't be a number cuz I know that I'm gonna have me some fun
Gotta stick to your guns
Stick to your guns...
Gotta stick to your guns
See the system it's so screwed
Gonna throw your life away
You gotta think man your life's just begun
Don't be a sucker cuz I know that I'm gonna have me some fun
Gotta stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
See the playground it's just in sight
The arm full lodged says it's just in strike
Clouds are forming, clouds overhead
We're all living for the blood that we shed
Let's clear the slate
Life's gonna be great cuz I know that I'm gonna have me some fun
Always stick to your guns
Always stick to your guns
