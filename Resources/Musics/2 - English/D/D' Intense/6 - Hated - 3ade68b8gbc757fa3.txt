HATED

Well I've seen many things
In my eternity
I've felt all the poverty and wealth in my life
I feel I'm runnin' outta time
I've changed, rewritten, rearranged
I'll try until I die
I've kissed reality
And the whole damn world goodbye
As I ponder in the eyes of a fool
Realizing this nightmare's true
Deep in your thoughts I now control
Only to haunt you and break away from your hell
As I ponder in the eyes of a fool
Your deception only to profit you
Someday I think I just may ruin your life
Forever dead on the edge of a knife
I've been tricked too many times
Now I know - Being cool will sometimes take it's toll
Insane - Ripped off losin' my mind
Only to be crushed by deceptive lies
Your deceptive lies
So now you put me in a cage
Someday I'm just gonna get away
It's like falling in a bottomless pit
Another selfish game of hit and miss
Eyes open - Now I can see
Just what's happening to me
Sometimes I'm my worst enemy
But if looks could kill you'd be dead you see
Still I ponder now you're the fools
Table's turned, the nightmares yours
All the strain, rearranged
Havin' to deal with yourself
Now the hell is yours
