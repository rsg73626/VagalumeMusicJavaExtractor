THE PUPPET

Such a cute doll seems to be your friend.
A small evil face 'till the deadly end.
The trilogy of terror has just begun.
You'll be lucky to see the morning sun.
Running through your room with a razor bite,
another victim, another bloody site.
Run, run, run as fast as you can.
The puppet has you in the palm of his hand.
[Chorus:]
Having no direction, only terror tonight.
A mindless puppet, a puppet on a string.
You're on a string of fright...
A spell's been cast, a spell from eveil dawns.
A spirit of death is all around.
A doll stabbed with a pen.
The powers never gone.
[repeat chorus]
Running through your room with a razor bite,
another victim, another bloody site.
Run, run, run as fast as you can.
The puppet has you in the palm of his hand.
Stabbing and knawing on your leg.
Pop it in the oven and start to bake.
Evil creature, it only smiles.
Come on over, mother.
Haven't seen you in a while.
