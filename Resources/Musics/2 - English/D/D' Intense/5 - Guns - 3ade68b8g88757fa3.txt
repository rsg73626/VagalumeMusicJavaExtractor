GUNS

Weapons, weapons, weapons
M-16's, and 45's they help your country stay alive
They got the guns but we got the trigger
That gun of mine make me feel a whole lot bigger
Social dogma you think you're safe
I think I'm losing my mind
Deal with reality deal with facts
I've got'em shooting at me I'm gonna shoot back
Cuz I like guns and guns like me
I like guns they made America free
I like guns and guns are the way
I like guns
So your lost in your lost world
With my own weapon I'd rather be dead
People on the streets getting shot every hour
That's what Tawny Schnieder said
Time to look out your front door
Blow that sucker right on the floor
Load your gun and let him have it
The right to bear arms the right to be free
Cuz I like guns and guns like me
I like guns they made America free
I like guns and guns are the way
I like guns
Weapons, weapons, weapons - GO!
People on the street you think you're safe
There little guns all over the place
They'll take our toys and the government'll have them
It's time to not let them oppress you
Time to force your life on them
Tell 'em the way cuz you know it
Tell 'em the way cuz that's your right
I like guns and guns like me
I like guns they made America free
I like guns and guns are the way
I like guns
Remember
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bear arms
They'll wind up coming to get you
