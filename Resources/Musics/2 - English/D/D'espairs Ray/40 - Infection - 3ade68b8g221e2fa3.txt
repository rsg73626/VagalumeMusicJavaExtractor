INFECTION

My soul is frozen and it's tied...
My ears find no voice of you
My legs torn in sadness
I'm standing in teh darkness
I can never go on

Rain in the way....
The light is far way...

How manu times did I shout your name in the storm?
My voice is Dryin out
I live because of you
So I belive
"close your eyes"
Thenfore this pain never heals

My eyes flowing with sorrow
has twinsted my world
Everlasting memories have lost its taste
and became mu enemu and hate

Rain in the way....
The light is far way...

How many times did I shout your name in the storm?
My voice is drying out
I live because of you
So I belive
"close your eyes"
I know...
I can never reach for you

I live because of you
So I belive
"close your eyes"
I don't regret dying for you
