DEATH POINT

All these rules, who decided?
Turn the whole world against me?
Maybe, but not here

[Hey you, listen up]

You can't buy more time and so
Why live [why live] with hands bound tightly?
Cut the ropes and live free

[Take the dive]

Do not just ask for help
But fight for yourself

Choose if you will follow
Your own path
Welcome to death point

Don't you ask for help
Stand, fight for yourself

With a life not your own, you're shallow, slowly dying

Death point...

Humans want, it's what we do
Anything to snag the prize
How far will you go?

[Can you hear me now?]

Some things you should never trade
Can you [can you] really sell your soul?
I would sooner die

[As for you]

Do not just ask for help
But fight for yourself

Choose if you will follow
Your own path
Welcome to death point

Don't you ask for help,
Stand, fight for yourself

With a life not your own, you're shallow, slowly dying

Death point...

Do not just ask for help
But fight for yourself

Choose if you will follow
Your own path
Welcome to death point

Don't you ask for help,
Stand, fight for yourself

With a life not your own, you're up next, soon to follow

[Stand by yourself]

Only two ways to go, live your life or die trying

Death point...
