GOTHIC

There was nothing but the sands as far as the eye could see 
I am nearly dying of thirst always 

Cureless of the dry and pain 
I asked for sleeping another mask into the your mind 

Struggled to get free from the chain 
She intense whipped the my body 
But I endured the pain in silence 

There was nothing but the sands as far as the eye
could see...
