GOING ON!

You said you keep dreamin'
But you're trapped in the regulation
Can't see what you're waiting for
Can't find what you're looking for
Somebody's boring rail
Somebody's golden rules
Do you think you're happy with the lies ?
Just break me free from this world
Keep goin' flat out, broken brakes
Yeah ! Keep on going going on !
"Going on ! Going on !"
To the far side of the world
Where nobody's been before
"Going on ! Going on !"
Get away !
On the late night TV show
Lawless time's just woke up
But you keep staying in the lawful world
Like a wind-up doll !
Somebody's wisdom words
Somebody's handy tools
Do you think you're the one with the truth ?
I feel cold in the way you speak
Keep goin' flat out broken breakes
Yeah ! Keep on going going on !
"Going on ! Going on !"
To the far side of the world
Where nobody's been before
"Going on ! Going on !"
Get away !
You mother fucker ! I'm fucking tired !
I don't want to be a damn slave like you
I'll live to be free
Having a "core heart"
Believin' in myself
I don't fear, I keep on praying
I will crush the wall
I will go ahead
I will not care even if the world ends here
Keep goin' flat out broken brakes
Yeah ! Keep on going going on !
"Going on ! Going on !"
To the far side of the world
Where nobody's been before
"Going on ! Going on !"
Get away !
You motherfucker ! I'm fucking tired !
I don't want to be a damn slave like you
I'll live to be free
