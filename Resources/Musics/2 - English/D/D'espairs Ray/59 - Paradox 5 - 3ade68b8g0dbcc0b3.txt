PARADOX 5

You who sleeps enveloped in flames departed
longing for a distant, far off calm

Ascending to the moon
to the source filled up with nostalgia

Inextinguishable love, amid the current
return to liberation and salvation

Faint memories vanish into the sea
that is the origin of everything
at the end of a distant, long purification

Falling from the moon
becoming a rain bestowed upon the vast earth
and pouring down

Taking a breath into its body
an unselfish soul at its beginning
Inextinguishable love, amid the pain
dwell in a new life

samsara


Inextinguishable love, amid the current
overflowing with liberation and hope
You walked out toward rebirth... a reticent soul

samsara
