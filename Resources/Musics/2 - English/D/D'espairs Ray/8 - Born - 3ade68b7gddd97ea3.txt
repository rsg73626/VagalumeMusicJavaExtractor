BORN

Why... Life...
fukai na koe to nozomi moshinai fujiyuu ni tsunagarete

Why... Die...
yami ga nomikomi kankaku wo sutete shimaeba mitasareru

Ikiru imi sae mo wasurerarenu kutsujoku no hibi mo
keshite shimaitai... yowasa to tomoni die away...

I want to broke mind... I was born again tadare ochiteku
I let it all out... it all over again... 
welcome to... nothing to worry about... 

Why...Life...
akka shiteyuku kuchibiru wo kamu iradachi wa hifu wo saki
Why... Die...
takanaru kodou tomeru subenaku nijimidasu keno kan

Fukai tameiki to fumidasezu ni furuedasu kata wo
itami tsumeato kurushimi ga sono kurushimi ni yudane*

I want to broke mind... I was born again, hai to kashita yowasa de
I let it all out... it all over again... 
welcome to... nothing to worry about... 

Something broke and you were born again, koe wo takaku hibikase
All you have to do it just follow me 
welcome to... nothing to worry about... 

"Ikiru imi nado wa nai" sou kuchizusamu kimi dokokade mata sagashite wa toraware,
tozasareta shinen ni hikari ga sasu koto mo nakute You are another grazing at die... 

I want to broke mind... I was born again, nanimo osore wa shinai
I let it all out... it all over again... 
welcome to... nothing to worry about... 
I want to broke mind... You are born again, kimi ni afuredasu ai
All you have to do it just follow me 
Last words for you... worry same the scars...
