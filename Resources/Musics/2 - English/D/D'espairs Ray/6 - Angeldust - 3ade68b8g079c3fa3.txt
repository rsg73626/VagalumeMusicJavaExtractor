ANGELDUST

With all of my pain undying spirit of mine
with all of your pain undying spirit of your

Howl of Existence
aratana kaze ga yami wo saku

Mugen ni afuredasu souzou kasoku shiteiku kodou...

With all of my pain undying heart of mine
with all of your pain undying heart of yours

Scream your Existence
kanousei ga rekishi wo kizamu

Mabushii mirai e no tanjou kyoumei suru kandou... ah

Brand New Days... Brand New World... Brand New Sunrise...
"Hello" I'm just feeling to the last scene...
"Hello" I'm just falling with you...

Kaze sasageita koe, ikiru imi wo nosete
hoshi matataite yume, umarete yuku inochi e
kataritsugu negai wo takushite

Brand New Days... Brand New World... Brand New Sunrise...
"Hello" I'm just feeling to the last scene...
"Hello" I'm just falling with you...
"Hello" I want to love this world...
