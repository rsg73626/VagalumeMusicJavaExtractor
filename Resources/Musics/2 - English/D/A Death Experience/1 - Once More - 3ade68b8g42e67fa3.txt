ONCE MORE

It´s my life and it´s just an endless pain
there´s no sun in my dreams, no future i see
darkness overwhelms me day by day
and i pray...

dislocate me and close my eyes

the rainy days that signs my life
take away my power all the time
they show me live is a misery
call of other sides of life
in my left hand i hold a knife
deadly spheres i strife
the untold pain´s alive

arcane memories brought me down
death whispers my name
i´m here and i´m alone
death finds me, i fall

fall into me
future i see
abyss is me
free

now my days are numbered
the voiceless speak to me
i dread to hear
(my time approaches the end)
i call once more

arcane memories brought me down
death whispers my name
i´m here and i´m alone
death finds me, i fall

the rainy days that signs my life
take away my power all the time
they show me live is a misery
call of other sites of life
in my left hand i hold a knife
deadly spheres i strife
the untold pain´s alive

arcane memories brought me down
death whispers my name
i´m here and i´m alone
death finds me, i fall

i die
once more
