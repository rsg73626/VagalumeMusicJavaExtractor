BREATHE

Another sleepless night.
The cold air fill my lungs.
I'm sinking through the floor.
I'm fading in the walls.
I've had enough.
Another sleepless night.

I'm losing myself.
I've lost all hope.
I'm losing my health.
This violent slope.

Trapped inside my mind
I need to escape
Trapped by time.
Why won't it wait...

Depression consumes me.
No, misery doesn't wait.

This life of mine, I bend and break.
This life of mine, is yours to take.
Lost in the walls.
I'm left to blend.
I can change it all.
If my life, I end.
And the new, I begin.

I feel like I'm falling.
I've been falling for years.
I'm calling, but no one can hear.

I've given my best.
I've given my all.
My neck it breaks.
No, I can't stand tall.
My back it fails.
My body it aches, with each and every breathe that I take.
I'm ready to fall.
My heart it stops.
Forget it all.
My mind it drops.
I hate this world and what it's given me.
I hate that I wake.
I hate that I breathe.

This life of mine, I bend and break.
This life of mine, is yours to take.
Lost in the walls.
I'm left to blend.
I can change it all.
If my life, I end.
And the new, I begin.
