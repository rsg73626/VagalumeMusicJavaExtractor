2 years today, you left us.
And I’ve never felt so alone.
So distant...

Just one more day.
You give me no reason to fear death.
Just one more day.

I just hope that you’re not alone.
I just hope that you're free.

Always, you’re inside of me.
You’re not alone.
You give me no reason to fear death.


Tragedy consumes us all.
But your memories will live on.
You will live on
