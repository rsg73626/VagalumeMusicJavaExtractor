STARS IN YOUR EYES

They said you'd never get there
They said you'd never get far
Your heart was a skipping stone and the
water's deep
It starts to sink in
It hits your chest when you breathe in
Can't catch the break that you needed

They say you'll only get out what you give
And you will only get out when you live like
there's nothing to lose
Through the highest highs and the lowest lows
And in the dark you use the stars for light
(at night)

You don't need an aeroplane to fly
Reach out and touch a satellite
There's nothing in the sky
The stars are in your eyes
And when you start to feel alone
I'll be the one to let you know
There's nothing in the sky
The stars are in your eyes
The stars are in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes

Now the mirror is a blank stare
You're half the girl that used to stand there
Your heart was so far from home
That it's hard to see, if it's beating
So you picked up all the pieces
You packed your shit up and you're leaving

They say you'll only get out what you give
And you will only get out when you live like
there's nothing to lose
Through the highest highs and
the lowest lows
And in the dark you use the stars for light
(at night)

You don't need an aeroplane to fly
Reach out and touch a satellite
There's nothing in the sky
The stars are in your eyes
And when you start to feel alone
I'll be the one to let you know
There's nothing in the sky
The stars are in your eyes
The stars are in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes

Fine your balance and composure
You're lost in the galaxy
Space bound, come down
Find your gravity
Fine your balance and composure
You're lost in the galaxy
Space bound, come down
Come back down to me

You don't need an aeroplane to fly
Reach out and touch a satellite
There's nothing in the sky
The stars are in your eyes
And when you start to feel alone
I'll be the one to let you know
There's nothing in the sky
The stars are in your eyes
The stars are in your eyes
The stars are in your eyes
The stars are in your eyes
In your eyes, the stars are in your eyes
