THE OCEAN LIES

Throw it all away, just throw it all away.
You were always so good at burning bridges.
So casual, so calm.
You're to far gone.
And I'm feeling broken.
So hold onto what you've got here and don't you ever let go.
Don't let it go...

Like a thousand times before.
All these dreams and all these memories, playing over and over.

Now don't pretend.
'Cause you're lying to yourself.
She's just a friend, there isn't anybody else.

I buried my heart at the bottom of the sea.
Holding my breath.
Darling, you are all I see.

Between you and I the ocean lies.
But you're not so far away.
You're not so far away, no.
