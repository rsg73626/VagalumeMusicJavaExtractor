BARCELONA

Sometimes i feel like i dont know 
Whats going on and sometimes i 
Let to believe everything i know is wrong 
I keep on telling myself thats its real 
And always keeping the truth 
It`s all in my mind explanations 
For the way that i feel are 
So hard to find 
Sometimes i feel like i`m in barcelona
See anytime i hear this tune I just start 
Drifting away.. 
And all i wanna do is go back
Back back back... 
Each time i decide that these
Feelings cant keep going on. 
It`s only a matter of time before 
They come back twice as strong...
