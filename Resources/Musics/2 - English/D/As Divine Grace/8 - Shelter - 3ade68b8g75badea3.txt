SHELTER

Cover me
With your harmony
Squeeze a bit of tenderness
From me cause I'm overflowing
From me cause I'm overflowing

Cover me
With your harmony
Whip the tears I cried away
You shift the blame on to you shoulders

What I ever wanted (yei, yei)
Whay I ever needed, (yei, yei)

You were there to hold me, (yei, yei)
You were there to help me, (yei, yei)

Where ever you are (yei, yei)
I will miss you (yei, yei)
Where ever you are (yei, yei)
I will seek you (yei, yei)

You are my source (yei, yei)
endless line of forms (yei, yei)
