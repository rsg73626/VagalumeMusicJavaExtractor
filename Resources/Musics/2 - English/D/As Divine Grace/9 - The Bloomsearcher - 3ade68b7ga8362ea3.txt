THE BLOOMSEARCHER

Will I be the greatest on
Will I shatter the seal of forms

The bloom of my sadness...
I travel and I seek my life
I laugh and I cry my mind out

I bloom and I tear heaven part
Sadness is mine and I can love

Lonelyness that's what I feel
Forever and it's real
Maybe, just maybe I'm the greatest one
I will shatter the seal of forms
