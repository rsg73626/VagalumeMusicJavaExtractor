RHIZOME

She was uncomfortable beside his bed that night
the pain was getting stronger
she felt so needless, felt she was just too
small
To understand the truth of him who lied there

She said breathe deep
Breathe deeper
She said breathe deep
Breathe deeper
She said breathe deep
Breathe deeper
She said breathe deep
Breathe deeper

It was just yesterday, so little time ago
He was crying, taling, smiling
But now it felt like silence was there to stay
His skin was getting colder and colder

She said flow deep
Flow deeper
She said flow deep
Flow deeper

She said breathe deep
Breathe deeper
She said breathe deep
Breathe deeper

Happy days were gone she realize it well
the pain was getting stronger
She took sweet things, the things that mattered at
that time
And put her head beside his love one

She whispered:

No I go
I have to leave
He passed away
As she said it
The end is now
Its no relief
No I go
I have to leave
