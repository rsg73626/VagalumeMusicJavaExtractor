PERPETUAL

Many have faded in silent garden,
faded and perished
Scarlet leaves increase on meadow,
where I was once with you

"I have shed tears for love
like winds I dance the leaves away
those scarlet leaves"

And This immense cradle of leaves
I shall ignite on flames
And I gaze how sheet of flames
billows submit serenity

I kiss your, glacial tear and your cheek feels so real
You tread away from me and
you fade, fade forever
