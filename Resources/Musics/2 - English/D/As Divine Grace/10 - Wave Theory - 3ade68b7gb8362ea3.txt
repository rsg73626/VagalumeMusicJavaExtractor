WAVE THEORY

When icy snow falls cold ground
2My naked soul flees from me.
And I give my crown to you
These are my farewells

holy in the name of my spirit
Crying till the end of this feeling
Sleeping through this endless dreaming

With black art she comforts me
Erotic Rhapsody, away, take her away
