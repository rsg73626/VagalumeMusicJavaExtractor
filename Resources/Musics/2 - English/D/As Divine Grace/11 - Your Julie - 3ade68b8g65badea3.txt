YOUR JULIE

Close the door behind
You have to be alone tonight
quite different mood you have
Instincts of something bad...

Who will scream in your rooms?
Crawl through your nightmares?
Creature of past?
Well, this is what you made of me!

Sorcerer, so tempting
Calling me
Here I come!
Wanting it
Or wanting not
You can not choose

Suffocating breath of mine
Brings you aware
That I am here with you
Watching every move you make!

Sorcerer, so tempting
Calling me
Here I come!
Wanting it
Or wanting not
You can not choose
