SPANISH JOINT

Whenever it rains I feel this way
a little sumthing 2 get me thorugh this
give me a little that, no time flat
gonna be a good thing

serene but in need of feelin free
letting go and landing on my feet
brushed the dirt off my back no time flat
gonna be a good thing

well people belive this saying is true
whatever will b will forever do
whatever the cost I'll pay in full
I ain't got nuthin to do with you

gotta get out gotta get out of here
im in the dark and the light looks sincere
brushed the dirt off my back no time flat
gonna be a good thing

all u do is complain about your pain
and the cloud that follows you wont cease to rain
dont look back handle that
make it into a good thing

something up in me gotta be
sole controller in control of me
a link in your chain just wont do
I dont want nuthin to do with you
