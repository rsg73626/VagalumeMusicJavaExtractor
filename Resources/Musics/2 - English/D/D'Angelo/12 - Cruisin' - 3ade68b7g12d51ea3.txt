CRUISIN'

Baby let's cruise,
Away from here
Don't be confused, baby
The way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand
Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin together
Music explaine for love 
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right
Do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other
Ooh, baby, baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music explaine for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love you when we're cruisin' together
(repeat)

Baby let's cruise
Let's fly away
Let's glide
Ooh, Ooh, Let's open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can stay there inside you and love you, baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music explain for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love you when we're cruisin' together
(repeat)
