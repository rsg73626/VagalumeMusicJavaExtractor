DEVILS PIE

(Chorus)
Fuck the slice, we want the pie
why ask why till we fry
watch us all stand in line
for a slice of the devils pie
drugs and thugs, women and wine
three or four at a time
watch them stand all in line
for a slice of the devils pie

who am i to justify
all the evil in our eye
when i myself feel the high
from all that i despise
behind the jail or in the grave
i have to lay in this bed i made
if i die b4 i wake
hope the lord dont hesitate
2 get 2 heaven done been through hell
tell my peeps all is well
all them fools whos souls 4 sale
sitting next to the jezebel

demons screamin in my ear
all my anger all my fear
if i holla let them hear
in this spinning sphere

(chorus)

main ingredients to this dish
goes like this
heres the list
materialistic, greed and lust, jealousy, envious
bread and dough, chedda cheese, flash and stash, cash and cream
temperatures at a high degree
wheres niggaz come to feast
hells this all about
apocolypse aint no doubt

everbody's ho'ing out all the loot, all the clout
right or wrong
do or die
only the vengance will pacify
watch your back and so will i
in these days and time

(chorus)

aint no justice
just us
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
time has come for most of us
2 choose in which god we trust
i know i was born to die
searching to find
piece of mind
with eighty five dumb and blind
there can be no compromise
