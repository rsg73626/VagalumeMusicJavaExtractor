ALRIGHT

That's Alright,
We may have a misunderstanding
That's okay,
Because your my girl and I'm your man,
and that's just fine.
Girl your touch still drives me wild.
We'll be Alright
Cause all we have to do is just talk for a while
And if we don't see eye to eye,
At least we tried.
WE been through too much
To let all the little things get in the middle of...
So let us ease back-Relax
'Cause everything's gonna be Alright'.

CHORUS

Gonna be Alright...
...Be Alright

(Repeat 3x)

Baby Doll,
YOu don't have to worry at all
Cause it's Alright.
Girl we've climbed to high to fall.
So let's talk about it
And BAby if we disagree, then let's forget about it
Cause in the end I'll always love you and you'll love me.
And if we don't see eye to eye,
At leasy we tried
We been through too much
To let all the little things get in the middle of...
So let us ease back-Relax
'Cause everythning's gonna be Alright'.
