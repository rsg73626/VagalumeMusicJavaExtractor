S.D.M.

Why are you sleepin with my woman

Why are you sleepin with my woman

This comes as a total surprise 

I just can't believe my eyes

My best friend and my wife

Chorus:

(Instrumental)

Verse 2:

Why the both of you all buck bald naked

Why the both of you all buck bald naked

I'll tell you what's on my mind

I'm bout to go get my nine

And kill both of yalls behind

Chorus

Why the both of you bleeding so much

Why the both of you bleeding so much

Why the both of you bleeding so much

Why I am I wearing hand cuffs
