I FOUND MY SMILE AGAIN

[Chorus:]
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again

I don't know what it is that you're doing
All I know is baby, that you're shonuff doin it good
And you look at me, and my hear just starts the moving
I haven't felt like this in a while
Girl I wanna thank you, for helping me find my smile

[Chorus]

My smile, hello hello smile, I haven't seen you in a while
Your love, girl your love, you make me feel like I'm on a cloud
And since I laid eyes on you, my spirit's been brand new
And I wanna thank you child
Oh, helping me find my smile

[Chorus (2x)]

1, 2, 1, 2, 3
You helped me, find my smile again
Honey baby got me smilin [13x]
Smilin, smilin, smilin [2x]

[Chorus (2x)]
