SEND IT ON

(Chorus)
Send it up
Send it through
Send it right back, 2 U
Send it up
Send it through
Send it right back, 2 U

Your inner view, to me
Is something that I, do desire
Struggling 2 see, a new,
Smething that I, fantasize
So I'm sending

(Chorus)

U can't disguise your emotions
U know that I see, in your eyes
U soul's me, your soul's somethin' that I, feel inside
(Run, run, run, run, run) If I run, Lord only knows how far
that I and I will fall behind
Gotta find a better place, find a better space
So that I, so my life may be the reason why

Bridge:
Hold on, be strong, 4 your own
Move on, b4 long, you'll get home
If your feeling insecure
U can be sure
Hoooooooo
Even if it take forever and a day for me 2 do
I gotta send it on, to U
Tell me what will I do
Send it right back 2 U

Vamp out
