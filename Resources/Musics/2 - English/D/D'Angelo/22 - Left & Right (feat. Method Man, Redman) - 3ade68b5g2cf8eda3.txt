LEFT & RIGHT (FEAT. METHOD MAN, REDMAN)

I see U dancing right now
I don't need to tell U that U know how
But baby U do (oh)
I said U belong
And if U dreamed 2 be free
I can take U there just follow me
Baby I won't,
I won't steer U wrong

And it seems like 2 me
U want someone to fit your pedigree
Baby I do, so what U want
Smack your ass, pull your hair,
And I'll even kiss U way down there
U know that I will
Think I won't

(Chorus)
Specially when U do it
Left & Right
(Keep it movin')
Up & Down
(Love when we do it)
Left & Right
(Keep movin')
Up & Down
Specially when U do it
Left & Right
(Keep it movin')
Up & Down
(Love when we do it)
Left & Right
(Keep movin')
Up & Down
Left & Right & Up & Down
Left & Right & Up & Down
Left & Right & Up & Down
Left & Right & Up & Down
Left-left-left-left

Here U are in my world
Make U feel like a pearl
Rub your back, and forfill your needs
So why don't we just, get undressed
Feel the tender touch of your caress
That's what I want
Why don't U give it 2 me

I will have U believe
There's no reason for U 2 leave
Stay right here, in my arms
Where you're safe and secure
And with me U can be sure
There's no threat, say U turn me on

(Chorus)
Bridge / Vamp:
I know that U know, the sexy little things U do
I know that U know, the sexy little things U do
