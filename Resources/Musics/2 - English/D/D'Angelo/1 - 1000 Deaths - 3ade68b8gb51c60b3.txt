1000 DEATHS

I can't believe I can't get over my fear
They're gonna send me over the hill
Ah, the moment of truth is near
They're gonna send me over the hill

I can't believe I'm so caught up in the thrill
Ain't nothin' (and nothing's) gonna change my will
Locked and loaded up, and I know the drill
(Say know what I'm saying)
They're gonna send me over the hill

I been a witness to this game for ages
And if I stare death in face, no time to waste
But oh!
And if I charge it to the game before
Every time I slip into the unknown
Well, that's only when the spot gets blown
It's war
That is the lord!
I won't nut up when we up thick in the crunch
Because a coward dies a thousand times
But a soldier only dies just once
Once, once

Yaweh, yehushua
He don't want no coward soldier
AAh stick it in the golden sand
Musta didna hearda ma prayer
I receive everything that it means
And wield it victoriously
Aha, and cast out all the wickedness
(When they) send me over the hill
I was born to kill
Send me over the hill

I been a witness to this game for ages
And if I stare death in face, no time to waste
But oh!
And if I charge it to the game before
Every time I slip into the unknown
Well, that's only when the spot gets blown
It's war
That is the lord!
I won't nut up when we up thick in the crunch
Because a coward dies a thousand times
But a soldier only dies just once
Once, once
