DREAMIN' EYES OF MINE

woah woah woah yeah yeah yeah x2

When I first saw you baby
I wanted to die
me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
started to cry then I'd dream
wishin' my fantasy
would soon become a reality
'Cause every time I see you baby
all I do is sigh
'cause you're the most precious thing baby
that my dreamin' eyes has ever seen 
so I continue to dream
me and those dreamin' eyes of mine

Bridge

Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination runnin' too far
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see
somethin' like me being with you
and you being with me


Chorus
 
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
you're love be the chery in my chocolate covered dreams
so it seems my oh my
me and those dreamin eyes of mine

Oh my goodness here she comes
switching that ass
I wonder if the men in her past
had treated her bad
but if I had the chance
I'd treat her like a queen 
Just like I do in all my dreams
If you only knew how many times
that I think of you
I'm quite sure that you would find yeah
I'm sure that you would find
I'm going out my mind
my oh my, me and those dreamin eyes of mine

Bridge

Chorus (repeat to fade)
