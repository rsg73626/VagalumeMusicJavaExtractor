TILL IT'S DONE (TUTU)

In a world where we all circle the fiery sun
With a need for love
What have we become?
Tragedy flows unbound and there's no place to run
Till it's done
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon
Where do we belong? Where do we come from?
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon
Till it's done

Till it's done
Carbon pollution is heating up the air
Do we really know? Do we even care?
Acid rain dripping on our trees and in our hair
Are you there?
Clock ticking backwards on things we've already built
Sons and fathers die, soldiers, daughters killed
Question ain't do we have resources to rebuild
Do we have the will?

Perilous dissidence evening up the score
Do we even know what we're fighting for?
Destinies crippled and thrown about on the floor
When we're waging war
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon
Where do we belong? Where do we come from?
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon
Till it's done
Till it's done
