CHICKEN GREASE

Let me tell ya bout the chicken grease
stuffs and things to make the people get out ya seat
everybody its cool if u wanna clap your hands and stomp ya feet
come on down to the front where you can feel the beat

I know u love me cos I'm funky cos I jus wanna show u some love

chicken grease chicken grease

2 get 2 the otha side
yall cross the road
but not the kid
see im like that old bucket of crisco
thats sitting on top of the stove
simmer to a sizzle like the days of old
but I'll wait till I've mastered this
let the others go first
so the brothers wont miss
fried till its burned and crisp

now u know how its goin down
start at your neck then thru your back
then it works its way down 2 ur feet
so unique come on everybody lets dance to the beat
I jus wanna put u down
I just want yall to get down
everybody come on and get down 2 the chicken grease

If you wanna come on down to the front
