AFRICA

Africa is my descent
and here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that is meant
for many men not my tone

The blood of god is my defense
let it drop down to my seed
showers to your innocense
to protect u for all eternity
and with this wood I beat this drum
and we wont see defeat

From kings to queens becomes a prince
knowledge wisdom is
undersdtanding what we need

Ever since the day u came
my whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
4 your own
everday I see u grow
and remember what u already know
I recieve the love
that radiates from your glow

From which u came was love
and thats how it all should be
u adn my soul are I
though all the time and history
