WHEN WE GET BY

when we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love
i look in your eyes, when i look in your eyes 
i know what your thinking of
T'is a beautiful day, and you're welcome to stay 
we can spend some time and catch the matinee 
you're so fine, and the day is fine, and we'll be fine
when we make it by and we get by with love

Chorus

when we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love

Repeat

when we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love
i look in your eyes, i look in your eyes 
They're pretty as the skies above 
Everything, everything, everything is okay
we could make love in the shade, sip some chocolate lemonade
You're so fine, and the day is fine, and we'll be fine
when we get by and we make it by with love

Repeat Chorus

when we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love
i look in your eyes, i look in your eyes 
i know what you're thinking of 
'Cause it's a beautiful day 
And you know that's a fact
You scratch mine 
And i'll scratch your back sugar
You're so fine
And today's fine
When we make it by
And we get by with love
