SMOOTH

1st verse

How do you retain your cool,
Seems you love breaks all the rules,
You may think that I'm a pro,
But I can never seem to keep my control.
How can you stand to take things so slow.

Bridge

Look at you, You're so smooth,
When I'm around you, I can't keep my cool
Repeat 1 time

2nd verse

I'm so used to getting what I want
When I want it, and where I want it.
But in your field I"m inexperienced,
So inexperienced, Baby I'm delirious

Chorus

Look at you, You're so smooth.
When I'm around you, I can't keep my cool

Repeat 2 times

Bridge

I can't keep my cool
When you're around, I won't be the fool
You may that I don't know
