HOW DOES IT FEEL (THE REAL VERSION)

Girl it's all on U
Have it your way
And if U want, U can decide
And if you'll have me
I can provide
Everything, that U desire (uhhh)
Said if U, get a feeling
Felling that I'm fee-ling
Won't U come closer,
2 me baby
Then U already got me, right where U want me baby
I just wanna be your man

How does it feel (2x)
Said I wanna know how does it feel
how does it feel (2x)

I wanna stop
(Sick of all) Silly little games, that U and me play
And I am feeling right on
If U feel the same way baby
Let me know right away
I'd love to make U wet
In between your thighs, cause
I love when it comes inside U
I get so excited when I am around U

How does it feel
(Tell me how it feels yeah)
How does it feel
Said did it ever cross your mind
How does it feel (3x)
(Tell me how it feels yeah)
How does it feel
Said it's been on my mind yeah
How does it feel (2x)

Bridge:
Said it's been on my mind, yeah
Baby close the door
Listen girl I have something I wanna show U
I wish you'd open up, cause
I wanna take the walls down, with U

Vamp out
