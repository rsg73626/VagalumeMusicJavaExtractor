UNTITLED (HOW DOES IT FEEL)

Girl it's all on you
Have it your way
And if you want you can decide
And if youll have me
I can provide 
Everything that you desire
Said if you get a feeling
Feeling that I am feeling
Won't you come closer
To me baby
Youve already got me where you want me baby
I just want to be your man

How does it feel  (x5)

I wanna stop silly little games you and me play
And I'm feeling right on
If you feel the same way baby
Let me know right away
I'd love to make you wet
Inbetween your thighs
Cause I love when it comes inside you
I get so excited when I'm around you

How does it feel 
How does it feel
Said did it ever cross your mind
How does it feel 
How does it feel
How does it feel
Tell me how it feels yeah
How does it feel
Said it's been on my mind
How does it feel
How does it feel

Baby close the door
Listen girl I have something I wanna show you
I wish you'd open up
Cause I wanna take the walls down with you

Vamp out xx
