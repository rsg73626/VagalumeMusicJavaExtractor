FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE

Strollinâ€™ in the park
Watchinâ€™ winter turn to spring
Walkinâ€™ in the dark
Watchinâ€™ lovers do their thing

Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making love to you
Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making dreams come true

When you talk to me
When youâ€™re moaninâ€™ sweet & low
When you touch me
And my feelings start to show, show, oh

Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making love to you
Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making dreams come true

Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making love to you
Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making dreams come true

In a restaurant
Holdinâ€™ hands by candlelight
Wanna touch you
Wantinâ€™ you with all my might
 
Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making love to you
Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making dreams come true

Thatâ€™s the time I feel like making love to you
