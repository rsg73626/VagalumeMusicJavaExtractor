AIN'T NO SUNSHINE

ain't no sunshine when she's gone
it's not warm when she's away
ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
and she always gone too long
anytime she goes away

wonder this time where she's gone
wonder if she's gonna stay
ain't no sunshine when she's gone
and this house just ain't no home 
anytime she goes away

and I know (repeat I know 20 more times)
hey ya auta leave the young thing alone

but ain't no sunshine when she's gone
only darkness every day
ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
and this house just ain't no home 
anytime she goes away

ain't no sunshine when she's gone
it's not warm when she's away
ain't no sunshine when she's gone
and she's always gone too long
anytime she goes away
anytime she goes away
anytime she goes away
anytime she goes away
