PLAYA PLAYA

Steal U with my 2 shot
Control U with my drop
Blaze U with my handle
Bless U with my props
Play U like a pro
And take over the show
Stick U and defeat U
Rob U of your glow
Rob U of your glow

(Chorus)
Bring the drama playa
Give me all U got
Make your move
Shoot your best shot
I see right through your riddle
Slip right past the block
Set U up for 2
Shoot your best shot
Shoot your best shot

We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one

Playa playa play me
We dyin 2 set it off
Marlon, Slick and Weasel
Can hardly wait 2 ball
My groove is tight drummers,
drummin' right
Dirts our secret weapon
Each and every night
Each and every night

We came here 2 rip shit
Strip U of your clout
Later 4 all y'all haters
We gon' turn this motha' out
If U came to ball, U gonna lose it al
We don't plan to stop
Til U bounce off the wall
Til U bouncin' off the wall

(Chorus)
We're the playas number one '
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
