THE ROOT

One, two, three, four....

She done worked a root.
Done worked a root that will not be reversed
Then I go on, go on my role in her play with no rehearsal
Said, I left my mojo
Left my mojo in my favorite suit...(yes I did, yeah)
She left a stain, left a dirty stain in my heart, I can't refute.

She done worked a root!

(Chorus)
In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine.
From the Alpha to creation, to the end of all time.

Said I went, Said I went, Said I went to the doctor.
The man told me there ain't nothin' wrong with me
But I beg to differ, I been feelin this pain for much too long
I feel like my soul is empty
My blood is cold and I can't feel my legs
I need someone to hold me.
Bring me back to life b4 I'm dead.

She done worked a root...root...rooooot.

(Chorus)

I feel my soul is empty
My blood is cold and I can't feel my legs,
I need someone to hold me
Bring me back to life before' I'm dead..

She done worked a Root.

In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine.
From the Alpha to creation, to the...

To the end of all Time!!

Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine.
