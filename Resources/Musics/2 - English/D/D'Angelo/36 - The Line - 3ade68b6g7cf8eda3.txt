THE LINE

I've gotta tell you, tell u about it
Ive been gone for so long
I just wanna sing my song
I know u been hearin
hearin a lot of things about me

oh I know, I know
I've heard, i have heard it all to clear
this is what I am going to do

(chorus)
I am goin to hold, hold on to my pride
I'm gonna stick, im gonna stick to my guns
I'm gonna put my finger on the trigger
I'm gonna pull it and we gon see what the deal
I'm for real, i just wanna put it, put it on the line
I've gotta put it on the line
and we havent got much time
I've gotta put it on the line
know what im talking bout this evening
I've gotta put it on the line

I've got a bullet in the chamber
and im not afraid of the danger
we've gotta go down to the wire
ill go through the fire with you
kill and die with you
I know everybody watchin me
the pressure is on
from every angle
political 2 personal
will I hang or b left hangin? will I fall off?
or will it be bangin?
I say its up to the man upstairs

I am goin to hold, hold on to my pride
I'm gonna stick, im gonna stick to my guns
I'm gonna put my finger on the trigger
I'm gonna pull it and we gon see what the deal
I'm for real, i just wanna put it, put it on the line
I've gotta put it on the line
and we havent got much time
I've gotta put it on the line
know what im talking bout this evening
I've gotta put it on the line
