PRAY FOR THE END

They’ll see us rise
Eternity forever ours, eternity will forever be ours
Crawl to the demons’ gate

As you’re falling down, tell me how it feels to bleed like how they bleed
You fucking coward

They claim revenge with me on their side we won’t let go
With me

Gasping for air
It looks familiar
Breaking the odds
You’re now the victim

Pray for the end
The absolute horror
Pray for the end
The absolute terror

As you falling down
Tell me how it feels to bleed
Like how they bleed
You fucking coward

The absolute horror
The absolute terror

You’ll face what you can’t defeat

Welcome to your destruction

We will rise against you

Eternity will forever be ours, pray for the end
Eternity will forever be ours, pray for the end
You crawl to the demons’ gate
