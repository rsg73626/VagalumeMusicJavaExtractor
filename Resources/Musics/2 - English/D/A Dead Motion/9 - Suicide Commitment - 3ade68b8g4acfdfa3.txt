SUICIDE COMMITMENT

I've been waiting far too long
I've been waiting for far too long
To hang this rope around my neck

It looks like a disaster tonight

Again, this won't stop screaming inside my head
Again, this won't stop screaming your death

Your last moment won't settle for less
Than the noise your neck made when you pushed the chair

I am not the end
I'm not on the edge
I've waited, for so long
To hear this sound

For so long

I am not the end
I will be free

I though I gave it all
But I can see clear today
At the end of the wall
I'll write my own fucking way

My own way
I'll write my own fucking way
