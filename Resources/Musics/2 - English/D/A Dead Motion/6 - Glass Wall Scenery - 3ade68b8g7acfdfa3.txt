GLASS WALL SCENERY

Our time is counted
Puncture the walls
Crush the roof
A life is lost
As it turns to sin ruins remain yet decay
History leaves scars to those in time
As it turns to sin ruins remain yet decay

It's yet to be wrote
A life is changed its debt is yet to be claimed

Why everything just seems so right for you
When I'm falling out of home, without you
Tell me why should I feel consumed
This is more than I can see through

Our time is counted

Now
These walls are haunted
A stench is left behind
Revenge reeks the home that once was mine

Why everything just seems so right for you

When I'm falling out of home, without you
Tell me why should I feel consumed
This is more than I can see through

Straight to the cause
Here I stand dead
Pain beyond the immoral

Cold surgery tools had butchers touch
With a hint of hate

Straight to the cause
Straight to the source of what I've become
Straight to the cause
The straight source of what I've become
