CHAINSAW

I'll bury you, I'll bury you alive with no second hope
I'll bury you, I'll bury you alive
I swear you won't come back to spread the pain, you won't come
Back you will suffocate
Stop breathing, don't waste my air
Stop breathing, you will suffocate by my words, by my hands, by my rage inside
These days that no one knew won't be reborn
These days that no one knew won't be reborn
'Help me' You won't see the light again
'Help me' You won't see the light again I'll keep drowning you
I'll bury you alive with no second hope
I'll bury you alive...alive... by my words, by my hands, by my words, by my....
Nails after nails in your skin through your bones repent to the sound of your redemption
