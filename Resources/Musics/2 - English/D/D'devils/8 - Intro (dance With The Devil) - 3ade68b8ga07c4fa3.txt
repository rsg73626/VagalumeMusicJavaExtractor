INTRO (DANCE WITH THE DEVIL)

Where there is light, there is darkness
Where there is smoke, there is fire
Where there is a God, there is D'Devils


Ladys's and Gentlemem

To beat or not to beat
That's the question

So,
lets kick the base,
And unchain the moust mindblowing beats from Hell

Prepare to Dance qith the devil
And pray, tha you will survive...
