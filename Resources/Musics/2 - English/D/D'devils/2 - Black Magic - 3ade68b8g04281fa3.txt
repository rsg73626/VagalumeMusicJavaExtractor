BLACK MAGIC

To get in my existence...
Come closer, fear no distance...
There's one thing that I need,
Your promise to proceed!

Sell me your soul,
And I'll bring you power!
Sell me your soul,
And darkness will rule!

It's black magic, bad magic!

It's black magic, bad magic!

Don't stop! D... D... Don't stop!

Sell me your soul,
And I'll bring you power!
Sell me your soul,
And darkness will rule!

It's black magic, bad magic!

It's black magic, bad magic!
