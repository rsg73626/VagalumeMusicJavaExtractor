JUDGEMENT DAY

The day has come...

Judgement Day...

It is Judgement Day,
In the North computers are taking over the world..
In the East humans are becoming slaves for their own
creations
In the South people are running for their lives...
In the West you have the choice...

You can run or you can hide...
You can talk or you can Fight...
But remember...

Everything you say, can and will be used against you and your family...

So Shut up and dance...

Whether you are in the North, Easth, South or West...

Everything you say, can and will be used against you...

Judgement day...

North, Easth, South,West...

Judgement Day...
