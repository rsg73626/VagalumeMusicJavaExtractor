THE 6TH GATE

Six century ago...
The last man of the earth
Enter in my world...
Now is your turn to feel that pain

The gates are open...
Pain, anger, hate, fear, chaos, darkness, evil, hell...
The gates are open...
Gate one darkness, the wolrd of demons,look around you that ever here...

Gate two, my guards are watching you...
Gate three, only evil lives here...
Gate four, there's no way out...
Gate five, feel the fire...

Gate six, pick up your weapons and fight...
Fight, fight and dance with the devil...
The gates are open...
Sshhhhhh...

Gate one, gate two,gate three,gate four,
Gate five, gate six,six,six...
Now fight me again...
Fight, fight, and dance with the devil
