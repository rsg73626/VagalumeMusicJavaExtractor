LOST SIGHT (REMIX)

featuring Abdominal 

Inhale... Waiting to ex. from the speculation 
As my mind rotates in that 360 rotation 
Verbal sedation's eliminating the hesitation 
From the fascination that I'm facing 
but why am I facing fascination in the first place? 
The first taste of simple rejection would be the worst case in my thoughts... 
The first taste of should be the most unforgettable 
But the curse is laced with strict questions thats hypothetical 
Like how pathetically am I facing this situation? 
Will I ever make it real, 
or forever will it be a simulation of constant struggle and frustration 
Immediate thoughts of lost motivation fills my brain capacity 
While drasticaly i'll put in effort, and your response is fast asleep 
But still many men are passing me, really it has to be 
An offering that you can accept 
That I possess, but still I stress 
and ponder the thought of you just saying yes 
But we all know that will never be cause qualities in my anamotomy 
Could all be postive and that still wont matter see 
And again and again I try, you say no, and I say why? 
Then I try to lie to myself and say you're really not that fly 
But then I face reality and come to senses with my self 
And put my egotistical ways, way back up on the shelf... 
Cause on my impulses I'll act 
With a major effort to get my sight back

If love is blind, why can't I hand it vision? 
And how did I get myself in this position? 
But I got to keep switching...Back and forth, forth and back... 
Side to side with an effort to get my sight back... 

Elevate while my thoughts stay between that fine line 
Which be seperating life from love and hate 
I close my eyes and slowly meditate, hesitate, trying to set it straight 
Taking in big pictures while observations try to evaluate 
The scences that revolve around me, suspiciously 
Worshipping qualities religiousley, while physically not catching a vibe 
It seems that I'm always so underrated 
Cause the longer that I'm waiting lets others start escalating 
To the plateau that I had so anticipated 
Then I finally reach my peak and find the premises evacuated 
Obstacles that were faced left me infatuated 
Fascinated at the third degree, you see... 
I plea and contemplate, try to rebalance my situation, 
Words merely for conversation 
My feelings are based upon a pure relationship 
Blew a kiss then said peace and salutations 

** Hook ** (X2) 

Paradoxically elusive, but yet intrusive into my life 
This girl as wife...conductive to nice, love to seduce this 
Abusive? I'll never get, girl bet 
Hard to hit somebody when you're steady lying up in bed for weeks on end 
Which succinctly describes our scenario 
Moving together at a rhythm that be very slow 
Up and down 'til we reach that delectable crescendo 
Somewhat like a sexual merry-go-round 
On the agenda next? More sex I suspect 
At least that's what I select 
Might as well my shit remains erect for hours on end 
With the power to bend girlfriend 
Like wilted flower stems 
When were done we take a shower and then 
Mutual backrubs to ease those kinks 
From kinky athletics where the stress is on aesthetics 
But never prosthetics cuz I can't get with incisions 
If the love ain't natural, I'll leave blind and keep the vision missing
