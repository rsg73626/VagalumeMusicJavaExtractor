E.W. (EGLINTON WEST)

featuring Rhyno 

After the D there be the E and it suits me well 
D Sisive on Eglinton be the street where I dwell 
The Westside is parallel where my legend propels 
Also my brethrens as well but it ain't hard to tell 
Cause lyrically I'll be representing spots of all kinds 
I drop dimes on any competitor trying to take mine 
And when it's all said and done and I posess the full claim 
I hit the soul train back to E.W. (my domain) 
The home of insane crews paying dues and making news bulletins 
Ganja entrepreneurs, my street is full of them 
And hooligans of all types avoiding sentences 
Oriental men selling New York imported denim 
It's heaven when I start walking my block, taking all the sights in 
I know I got the white skin, but I fit right in 
And if you fighting, make sure you bring the right men 
Cause from Marlee ave to York Quare, we got nothing but titans 
Ready to battle, with words mad provacotive 
It all ain't positive, but living here is my perogative 
So keep it on the hush for all the hesitating people 
And check the unity at the Caribana pre-show 

(Chorus) 
The E.W.- 
The streets where the po-po roam 
It may not be much to others, but to brothers it's home 
The E.W. 
Let's make use of this coverage 
And don't throw up the W without an E in front of it 

I take a breath of fresh air and still be destined to get there 
Whether I'm at Glencairn or West of St. Clair 
I still be close by wondering if my street's still operating 
So I travel 32 bus lines straight throught the station 
And staying connected like Imediat paging 
Blazing up my quad, waiting for return calls from pay phones 
Y'all know the deal, if you don't ask my man Rhyno 
He'll tell you E.W. rocks the spot (T-Dot) 

(Rhyno) 
Athletic sweaters have imbedded my chest 
Claiming Eglinton West where the buddah gets blessed 
Nevertheless, it's the place where my head takes rest 
Multiplied drug sales til the cops get stressed 
Understood it's my hood and I don't complain 
Easy shopping when I'm rocking on the Keele domain 
Simple and plain, we trying to get our blocks sewn together 
Throwing E.W. signs and sporting ECKO sweaters 

(Chorus) 
The E.W.- 
The streets where the bashments play 
And roots men work night and day to earn the fastest pay 
The E.W. 
Let's make use of this coverage 
And don't throw up the W without an E in front of it 

For 18 plus years I be walking the streets clear 
Of any beef, mad peace and hoping that it will increase 
But when the beast gets there way, the peace is gone away 
And the pieces spray, leaving the peace a memory 
It's a hard thing to say but they be always harassing 
The DJ's clashing at local bashments in an orderly fashion 
Depriving our imagery while they physically 
Sending our citizens through misery, it's killing me 
So while we chilling, B, we gotta unify and skillfully 
Try to get Snoop screaming out "EWC" 
White pregnant bitches and clothes from Stitches 
Running from 13th division 
Through avenues and boulevards, pulling cards from those not on the 
blueprints 
So get nyammed like Albert's with more cuts than Loose Ends 
My crew extends therefore I'm crazy true to say 
That I'll forever be representing the E double vee 

(Chorus) 
The E.W. 
The streets where the blocks are shaded 
It ain't crew affiliated, but its our hood and we named it 
The E.W. 
The street where the po-po roam 
It may not be much to others, but to brothers it's home 
The E.W. 
The street where the bashments play 
And roots men work night and day to earn the fastest pay 
The E.W. 
Let's make use of this coverage 
And don't throw up the W without an E in front of it
