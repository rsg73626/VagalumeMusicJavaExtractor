HI 'N' LO

When I saw you standing in the rain 
I couldn't get much wetter 
I was feeling no pain 
I said Mr. Daniels can't you see 
You know you really got a hold on me 
I can't stay but I can't let go 
I'm telling you babe I'm a Hi 'N' Lo 

I don't even know your name 
I don't even know your name 

Thinking back to the very first time 
Well you were there with me 
And she looked oh so fine 
But then you played a dirty trick on me 
Sure that's alright cos' next time it's gonna be twice as good as this 
Then she gave me a kiss 
But that wouldn't do no thanks to you 

S, S, Prrriest...... 

Roll on time, just don't roll over me 
See, see I was too slick to trick the timeless parody 
Hey, uncle Jack have you heard the news I just put cleets on my blue suede shoes 
It's a brand new game, I might change my name 
And no one's ever gonna be the same 

I don't even know your name 
I don't even know your name 
I don't even know your name 
Honey, I don't even know your name 

Yeah....Yeah....Yeah.....
