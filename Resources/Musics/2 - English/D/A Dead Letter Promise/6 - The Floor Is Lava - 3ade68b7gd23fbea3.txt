THE FLOOR IS LAVA

Terror began. Or it will happen eventually. I do. I do. Demand and command the tendencies of fly’s. I’m only
waiting for the time to let you down. Were not the ones on trial here. Ready… now? I’m only waiting for the time to let you down. Ready… now? I wont die from natural causes. Ready… now. I know it will happen eventually. Bravest hunters roam in packs, why your practically a gladiator. Consider me the reigning king of coded messages.
