S ENOUGH

I love to wear you.
Jump right into you.
I speak for all of us.
I am too many.
You are a fucking fish.
Eviscerate you.

Snuff the life breath.
Snuff the life.
Snuff the life breath.
Snuff the life.

You are so soft.
Ripe for the picking.
I am so soft.
Rotten inside.
Repent your life.
Repent your useless life.

Snuff the life breath…

I will never hurt you
I will never kill you
I could never hurt you
I could never kill you

Snuff the life breath
Snuff the life
Snuff the life breath
Snuff the life
Life…

I love to wear you.
Jump right into you.
I speak for all of us.
You are a fucking fish.

Snuff the life breath…
