ASLEEP

Help me.
I’m begging.
I need your life to stay alive.
Hear me.
I’m begging.
I need your life before I fall asleep.

Leaving, with nowhere to go
I’m asleep
Feeling, with nothing to know

Sing with me.
Sing me into your dreams.
Sleep with me.
Sleep me into your dreams.

Asleep…
So you cry.
I’m gone, I never meant no harm
Asleep…
I’m a sigh.
I’m done, weeping my sorrow

Leaving, with...

Sing with me. (I’m falling asleep)
Sing me into your dreams.
Sleep with me. (I’m flying away)
Sleep me into your dreams.

Where am I now? (GOD)
I do not know!
I need you now! (GOD)
I need you so!

Where are You now? (GOD)
I do not know!
I need you now! (GOD)
I need you so!
