PARADISE SWEET

Lights out, I see no shine
Mindless, I’m all unknown
My God is foul

I’m born without a trace
Hiding before the end
Might cut you open

Sweet is the sound of rain
I’m down with my hurt again
Crashing in
Make room for me
Sweet is this paradise
It’s unreal

Sweet
(raining sentiments)
The sound
(lingering in me)
I am down
(I dive into the blue)
I’m crashing in

This road is closed for good
It’s been expecting my life
I’m out of reach

One more kiss
One more time
No more pain
No more time

One more kiss
One more time
I am down
I am crashing in

Sweet is the sound of rain…

(One more kiss)
All the ancient melodies
(One more time)
Die along with the human race
(No more pain)
All the priceless history
(No more time)
Will be lost like you and me


All the ancient melodies
(Sweet is the sound of rain)
Die along with the human race
(I’m down with my hurt again)
All the priceless history
(Crashing in)
Will be lost like you and me
(Make room for me)

Sweet is the sound of rain…
