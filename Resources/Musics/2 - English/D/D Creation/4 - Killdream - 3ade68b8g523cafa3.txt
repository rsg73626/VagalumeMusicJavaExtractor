KILLDREAM

I'm trying really hard.
I'm trying, finding me a heart.
I lose it when I'm not with you.
I choose to end my life with you.
Sleeping sweet.
Always and forever.
Dreaming dreams.
Bleeding hearts together.

I will take you with me.
I will rape your soul.
Beating, hating, killing.
I will rape you whole.

And now the night is calling.
Painting the sky above me black.
And all the stars are falling.
My loneliness is back.
Take my hand, I'll keep you sound asleep.
I'll pray the light away, you're in so deep.
A nightmare is here and haunting me.
Inside I'm still trying
Inside I'm still crying
Once again, I'll show you all your fears.
I'll break you down with pain.
You'll leave in tears.

Silence!
I am here to hear you.
Silence!
I am near to fear you.
Silence!
Taking everything from me.

I will break you with me.
I will rape you whole.
Cheating, faking, killing.
I will take your soul.

And now the night is calling.
Painting the sky above me black.
And all the stars are falling.
My loneliness is back.
Take my hand, I'll keep you sound asleep.
I'll pray the light away, you're in so deep.
A nightmare is here and haunting me.
Inside I'm still trying
Inside I'm still crying
Once again, I'll show you all your fears.
I'll break you down with pain.
You'll leave in tears.

Silence!
I am here to hear you
Silence!
I am near to fear you
Shut up!
I can still hear you
Shut up!
I can still fear you
Shut up!
Please, just go away
Shut up!

And now the night is calling.
Painting the sky above me black.
And all the stars are falling.
My loneliness is back.
Take my hand, I'll keep you sound asleep.
I'll pray the light away, you're in so deep.
A nightmare is here and haunting me.
Inside I'm still trying
Inside I'm still crying
Once again, I'll show you all your fears.
I'll break you down with pain.
You'll leave in tears.
