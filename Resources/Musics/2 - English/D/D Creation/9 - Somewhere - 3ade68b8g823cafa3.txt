SOMEWHERE

Where the sky is red.
Where the time stands still.
I am walking dead.
I am somewhere

Leave me be in peace.
Leave me far from life.
Death is all I see.
Death is everything.

Play with my mind
Play me, I’m fun-wanted
Engulf my mind
Engulf me, I’m fun-haunted

Staring at You, I am happy to see you still…
I am somewhere over the rainbow
Have me inside now that I am no more
I am somewhere over the rainbow

Fire walk with me.
Touch me, burn my life.
Death is all I see.
Death is everything.

Play with my mind…

Staring at You…

Somewhere, over the rainbow.
Way up high.
There is a land that I heard of…
Once in a lullaby

Staring at You…
