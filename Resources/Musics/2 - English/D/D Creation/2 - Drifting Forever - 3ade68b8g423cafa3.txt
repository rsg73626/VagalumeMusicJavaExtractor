DRIFTING FOREVER

Now the wind is catching me.
I am floating in a dream.
I am one with water.
I am everything.
I don’t ever want to come back.
I just want to dream forever.
I’ll send a dying whisper.
From the edge of time.

I am everything
I am everyone
I am everything
I am everywhere

I believe, all my dreams are real.
I am waiting forever.
I will always sleep. I will never leave.
I am drifting forever.

I can’t believe, you could ever leave.
I am waiting forever.
I am always here. I will never leave.
I am drifting forever.

My life’s ending soon. Your time is now.
I am leaving and dreaming and waiting for you.
My life was nothing. Your life is everything.
In darkness I’m lonely and waiting for you.

I do believe, all my dreams are real.
I am waiting forever.
I will always sleep. I will never leave.
I am drifting forever.

I can’t believe, you could ever leave.
I am waiting forever.
I am always here, I will never leave.
I am drifting forever.
