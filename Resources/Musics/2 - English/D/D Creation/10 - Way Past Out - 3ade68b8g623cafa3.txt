WAY PAST OUT

All my everything
Inside is outside
Soon before right now
No one somewhere

Come to go again
Happiness is sad
Beginning the end
Someone nowhere

My paining brain
My braining pain

It’s in the beating again
Tick-Tock, a choice-noise
It’s in the heating again
A boiling mind-game

Let me push me
It’s a soothing fall
Let me cloud me
The weather is quite fine

All the way to yesterday
In between the twilight
I am home now I am here
To be, or not to be

All the way it’s yesterday
Overwhelming skybright
I am new now I am old
Take me back, tomorrow

My paining brain
My braining pain

It’s in the beating again…

Let me push me…

I am climbing down
Everywhere way past out
I am upside down
Everywhere way past out

It’s in the beating again…

Let me push me…
