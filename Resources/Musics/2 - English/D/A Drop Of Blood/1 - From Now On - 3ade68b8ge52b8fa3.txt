FROM NOW ON

I am here to say that I never 
Thought you see suffering so 
See you cry will make me suffer even more 
I am here to say that I never 
I wanted to see you well (wanted to see you soon) 
And write here (write here) 
Everything that I felt 

But I hope that from now on 
Everything is for us renew 
Our lives are so different 
Living now all we dreamed 
Much is still to come 
Much still going to change 
I hope that from now on 

I am here to tell your heart 
Will show you exactly where you go 
We have a lot to live 
Time does not fool the most 
I am here to say that I never 
I wanted to see you well (wanted to see you soon) 
And write here (write here) 
Everything that I felt 

But I hope that from now on 
Everything is for us renew 
Our lives are so different 
Living now all we dreamed 
Much is still to come 
Much still going to change 
I hope that from now on 

I follow my path 
And you follow your 
And I think that's stronger than me 
I had my chance 
And not about anything else 
What can you stay 

But I hope that from now on 
Everything is for us renew 
Our lives are so different 
Living now all we dreamed 
Much is still to come 
Much still going to change 
This is my price for letting you go ...
