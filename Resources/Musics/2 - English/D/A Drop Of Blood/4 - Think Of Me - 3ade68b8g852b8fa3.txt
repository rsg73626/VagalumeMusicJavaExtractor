THINK OF ME

Inspiration of my dreams, I agree. 
I want to be alone, I can not fly. 
Why did you stop to think if my reflection is that you? 
Learning a single life, sharing pleasure. 

It seems that it's time I will not tolerate, 
If I always had strength and never stopped fighting? 

As a movie at the end everything will work. 
Who did you say that you need 's all right with you? 

(chorus): 

Think of me 
I'm thinking of you 
And you say 
What I want to tell you 
Come here, I see that you're together 
And you talk 
Again I love you 

The time we spent together will get you forever, 
Intimacies, games, but we understand. 

To date talker who is wasting time I say: 
Long I grew up not what I grew up with. 

Together in the balance of the network, under the starry sky, 
Always, the time when I'm on your 
side. 

The night comes I close my eyes and you is that I see, 
How do I stop you wanted to be and I want a: 

Think of me 
I'm thinking of you 
And you say 
What I want to tell you 
Come here, I see that you're together 
And you talk 
Again I love you (3x) 

Again I love you ...
