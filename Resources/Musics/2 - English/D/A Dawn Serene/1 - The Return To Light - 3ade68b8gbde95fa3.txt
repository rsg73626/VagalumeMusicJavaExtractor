THE RETURN TO LIGHT

caress my dear 
the fire is hunting our ghosts 
find this newborn to care 
all life leads to dust 
rise just to fall once again 
until we die - we fall and suffer in fear 
we cry in the light of a new dawn 

in this world - we fail - to rise 
unwillingly thrown - in this - this life 
we try to find - a path - a sign 
but we're doomed - we're doomed - to die 

so descend - to life - resist - defy 

in our pain - we try - in vain 
to become one - to grow - to gain 
we try to find - a path - a sign 
but we're doomed - we're doomed - to die 

so return - to light - embrace - revive
