APEX REALIZED

At the edge strike the heart
to the core (I feel it).
Merciless I let slip
dogs of war (and I feel it) 

Slowly drown in this cell
I have wrought (I feel it).
Someone else
forgive me
I cannot. 

Stone by stone I build day by day,
until such time as I must pay.
One by one the thoughts fade away to nothing.
I m left with this;
the apex realized.
