BURN IT ALL

Open the door and the light washes in. say what you will, i won't believe it anymore.
Everything's gone, i'm not where i belong,
It's the end of the song ... because i'm free now.

I broke the chain from my neck,
Torn away from that which binds.
Never will i be the one to believe in nothing...because i'm free.

(chorus)
Unexcused, unabsolved, i am alone but unafraid.
Undermined, undercut, you can't undo what i have made
Unexplained, unresolved, is it worth the price i have paid.
Understand.... i’ll burn it all.

Risen from ashes my life can begin. try what you will you can't resist it anymore.
Everything’s wrong, misconception is gone, i am where i belong... and i am free now.

I bear the wounds on my back… scars untold within my mind. ever will i be the one who will stop at nothing... to remain free.

(chorus)
Unexcused, unabsolved, i am alone but unafraid. undermined, undercut, you can't undo what i have made unexplained, unresolved, is it worth the price i have paid. understand.... i’ll burn it all.
