NEVER NEVER

Never, never.
(nanananananananana)
Moves around, moves around like a boomarang.
What you heard bout me, to do your own thing.
Moves around, moves around like a boomarang.
Maybe like, maybe like the sucker of a party.

Rap:
To the ladies in the house now don't be shy.
Dip a little deeper in your butterfly.
In a little madness I must confess.
God gave you the jiggy and the jiggy is blessed.
