I WILL BE WAITING

i wanna love you like i never loved you tonight
If it's alright
I wanna tell you things I've never said in my life
I'm gonna hold you when the sun refuses to shine
I wanna show you that I'll always be by your side
0o0o0h
*CHORUS*
When you call my name
And you need me there
Girl you know that
I will be waiting for you
When you close your eyes
And you see me there
Don't you know that I will be waiting..

I wanna kiss you like I'll never kiss you again
If it's okay
I can't imagine loving any other this way
o0o0oh

*chorus*
When you call my name
and you need me there
Girl you know that
I will be waiting for you
When you close your eyes
And you see me there
Don't you know that I will be waiting...

(when you call my name
and you need me there
girl you know that
i will be waiting for you
when you close your eyes
and you see me there
don't you know that i will be waiting..)

So what you wanna do
I wanna-be-with  you
I know that you like my style
So why don't you stay a while
And when you want me to
I'll wait for you...

**REPEAT CHORUS TIL FADE**
