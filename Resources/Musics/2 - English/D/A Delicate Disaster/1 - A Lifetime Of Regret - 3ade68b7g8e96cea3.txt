A LIFETIME OF REGRET

each night I sing you to sleep,
but you never sleep, because you
stay awake with me

I'll take the long way home just to be alone,
with my thoughts of you,
we sat for hours, out on your roof,
and in your room, and I promised
I would think of you

each night I sing you to sleep,
but you never sleep, because you
stay awake with me,
you never sleep,
you never sleep

I'll count the stars until I'm where you are,
because sleeping never did me any
good any way

each night I sing you to sleep,
but you never sleep, because you
stay awake with me,
you never sleep,
you never sleep

you're the only one that I want to call
at midnight to say sleep well,
you're the only one that scares me of
myself, I think, I know I'm falling for you
