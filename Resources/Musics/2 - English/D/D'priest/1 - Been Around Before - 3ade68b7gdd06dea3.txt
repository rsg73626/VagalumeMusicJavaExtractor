BEEN AROUND BEFORE

I feel so lonely
The world is empty every night and day
Locked in an era
A sea of madness in a world of pain

(Chorus)
Been around before
I just can't go on no, no, no, no
Same old song go on go home
This can't go on

So turn the lights down
Go on hold m, don't go away
Look at the mirror
You're in my arms, you're here to stay

(Chorus)

It's not hard to say it's easy
It's so hard to make it right
It's not hard to love
But good love is hard to find

(Chorus)
