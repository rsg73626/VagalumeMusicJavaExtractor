IT'S SO EASY

I can't believe my eyes... what do I see?
You're an angel straight from heaven...
So come on over... wrap me in your wings...
Goddess of love will you ever...

I keep searching... something is missing
Looking for the one
Outta love' cause you're missing...

(Chorus)
You know that it's so easy... easy to love you girl
Please don't leave me... searching for so long

Don't you know much longer I can wait
Spent a lifetime, can you see?
So won't you help me... please... please... please...
Angel of love, don't you fear...

I keep searching... something is missing
Looking for the one
Outta love 'cause you're missing...

(Chorus)
You know that it's easy... easy to love you girl
Please don't leave me... searching for so long...
It's so easy... easy to love you girl
Please don't leave me... searching for so long...
It's so easy... easy to love you girl
Please don't leave me... searching for so long...
