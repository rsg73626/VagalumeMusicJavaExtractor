RIDE YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT

It was I... the one that showed you the night
And you... opened it up, you came on through

(Chorus)
So go on, close your eyes... I'll set you free
You tell me deep inside... It's the only way

She wore black... yes, jet black
Bright red nails... I said, Baby, scratch me one more time

(Chorus)

Come on over... reach and touch me
Wanna ride you through the night

(Chorus)

Come on over... reach and touch me
Wanna ride you through the night
