LOVE GAMES

Dancin' with danger... crossing the line
Taking my chances... well, I won't get it this time
Going down, it's all so real... my head's in the fire
We are fighting with fear

(Chorus)
You know you should know better
Than playing with the Devil's fire
I know we're going to die
Can't hide 'cause we're runnin' outta time...

Over and over... you use me again...
You're turning around... so you won't go ahead
Going up and going down
You're telling me lies... 'cause you're fooling around...

(Chorus)

Time after time, and day by day... you play your love games
You play your love games... 'cause I know you're lonely
So play the love games... play the love games... play the love games
Play it again

(Chorus)

Time after time, and day by day... you play your love games
You play your love games... 'cause I know you're lonely
So play the love games... play the love games... play the love games
Play it again
