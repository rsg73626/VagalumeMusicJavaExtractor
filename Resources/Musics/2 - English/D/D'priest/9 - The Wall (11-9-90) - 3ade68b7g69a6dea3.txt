THE WALL (11-9-90)

Long long nights
are full of freedom
Germans fought for, every day...

Searching for freedom
That's what you've got...

All one nation
With two names...

Berlin stood still
That's what you've got...

So face to face... on the other side
No chins no more
You need a place, no place to hide
So you lose control...

Tear the wall down
Tear the wall down...

So face to face... on the other side
No chins no more
You need a place, no place to hide
So you lose control...

Tear the wall down... tear the wall down...
Tear the wall down... tear the wall down...
