MONEY HONEY

Money Honey... can make you turn your head now...
Money Honey... can get you where to get now...
Money Honey... can give you what you can get know...

(Chorus)
Money Honey you ain't got no respect
You smile at a fortune just to see what you can get...
And Money Honey got your breakfast in bed
Hey Money Honey... Oh... you drive me outta my head...

Living living... like a princess of the prom...
Giving giving... pouring on the charm
Money Honey... can get you where to get now...

(Chorus)

Money... Money...

Money Honey you ain't got no respect
You smile at a fortune just to see what you can get...
And Money Honey got your breakfast in bed
Hey Money Honey... Oh... you drive me outta my head...
