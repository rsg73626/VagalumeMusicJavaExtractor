MISS YOU

Hey kid... I got something to tell ya
One day I'll be gone and I'll miss you
Hey you... I gotta tell ya
Your dreams will come true... Oh they do

(Chorus)
All of my life... singing the songs
Closing a dream... why I keep moving on
All of my life... I keep going on and on

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Don't forget me... don't you know
Say you are with me... say you are
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Gonna make me cry... oh, cry
Babe I need you every day
Wanna love you... oh don't you know
Things can't stay this way

(Chorus)

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Don't forget me... don't you know
Say you are with me... say you are
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

(Chorus)

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Don't forget me... don't you know
Say you are with me... say you are
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
