RUSSIAN WINTER

You see the golden light... burning in the night
Look at the stars... they're falling...
Now that you lost control... it's tearing at your soul
It's hard to rock... let's roll

(Chorus)
No way to stop the freeze... it's your reality
You see the warning lights... fighting for your life
Snow bound... snow bound... just like a Russian winter
Hell bound... Hell bound... beware of the Russian winter in the U.S.A.

Oh and when your eyes are dim... you know the beast crawls in
To make you suffer again and again...
So have another round... with nothin' left but down
Gotta get back up again...

(Chorus)

Snow bound... snow bound... just like a Russian winter
Hell bound... Hell bound... beware of the Russian winter in the U.S.A.
