HEART BEAT

If you feel kind of low and you wanna go down
It's all right
Get rid of that pain, stop acting insane
Make it right

So you and I, oh tonight...
It's all right
So won't you come on, go make the call
Feel the bite... bite!

Be worry free, no dirty deed
Boy, you're right

I want to show you what you've never seen
What I've got, you need

Feel the beat of my heartbeat
All right, oh yeah
Feel the beat of my rock beat
All right, oh yeah

If you feel kind of low and you wanna go down
It's all right
Get rid of that pain, stop acting insane
Make it right

I wanna to show you what you've never seen
What I've got, you need

Feel the beat of my heartbeat
All right, oh yeah
Feel the beat of my rock beat
All right, oh yeah
