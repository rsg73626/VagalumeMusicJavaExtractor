I TRIED

I walk in the line
I leave everything stops backwards
I am waiting perpetual
We go to come back in the time of
When I could read its mind
Then I am waiting
Prisoner to a time that follows
To know if everything this is not my guilt


I tried to be perfect
I tried to be honest 
I tried to be everything that you always wanted
I tried to be strongest
I tried to be most elegant 
I tried to be everything, but it was not sufficiently


I wanted that everything I was as before. That nothing he had moved
Nothing of that had happened
I wanted to make only you happy
Please he forgives, me
Everything goes to be different of this time
You said a time to me loved that me 


And this made with that you if became part of my heart
Now you do not know to live without you
Without you my life has not felt
If you will be even so my heart you will fall in pieces


Please, if he does not go
I do not know to walk without you
I promise that everything will be different of this time


I want you
I need you
I want that I am always you and
I want you
I need you
I want that I am always you and


I tried to be perfect
I tried to be honest
I tried to be everything, but it was not sufficiently
