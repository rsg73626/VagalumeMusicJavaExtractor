AS I FEEL MYSELF

Difficult to say as I feel myself
To the times words they are not sufficiently
Everything that I know is that the days pass close to me
The thoughts on you remain constant

When I am with you
You could simply say for me to go
But you always are with me
And without you I do not obtain to smile
In my world
You will always have
You will always have
Only you

It will always lack air to me
When you will not be to my presense
and I feel myself as in a dance
When hug you me

You could simply say for me to go
Plus you always you are with me
Without you I do not obtain to smile
You will always have
But you
The thoughts on you remain constant
And I do not have none doubts
That I want that my life is only
Love you it has all the instants
Only
You
