THAIS

That day is today and of that month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I do not obtain to continue and I do not obtain to
come back 
It only wanted to come back in the time
And never to have wrong
Happy fact wanted to have you exactly that it is for
as

All the things that I want to say
They are not leaving right
I am stumbling at the words
You left my mind turning
I do not know pra where to go

And I do not stop to think about you
All the moment I hear your name
And my mind only says
Asking for you to come back
Thais
Necessary of you to continue

I am now without air
But waiting
Waiting you to come back
Necessary And of you so that everything makes
sensible

And I do not stop to think about you
All the moment I hear your name
And my mind only says
Asking for you to come back
Thais
Necessary of you to continue

And the tears are in my face
Waiting you to come back Necessary of you To continue
And I do not stop to think about you All the moment
I hear your name
And I ask for only plus a possibility
And my mind only says
Asking for you to come back
Thais
Necessary of you

And I cannot look at for the horizon without you
And my mind only says
Necessary of you
