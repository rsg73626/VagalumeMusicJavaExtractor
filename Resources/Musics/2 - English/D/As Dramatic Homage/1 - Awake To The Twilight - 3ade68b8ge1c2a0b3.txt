AWAKE TO THE TWILIGHT

Contemplating in silence, mythical symbols of life
Embrace by fire; declaim the glory of merciless empire
Divine visions take great desires for my astral
In stable reflexions versus dogmas of oppression

Close my eyes for the false sunshine
And awake to the twilight of the gods
And complex senses of life
Beyond of somber veil, wisdoms
take me horizons of freedom
The wise and strong reach soul brightness
announce a new season
After the grace of domain reasons

Close my eyes to the false sunshine
And awake to the twilight
Of the gods and complex senses of life
Celebrating the end of innocence
The spirit free raises the four elements
Under the insights
