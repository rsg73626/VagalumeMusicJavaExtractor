EMERGENCY

Hhm... hhm
I told you before
Listen
I'm dbanj
Hhm... hhm
Oshe
Mogbe

Baby tell me what's your name
Tell me what's your number
Is it me or something else?
Because your bakasy na thunder
You're driving me insane
You mess with my medulla
I no go let you go in vain
And wen I catch you na forever
Emergency, emergency
You never see me coming through (4ce)
Gbangba robo robo robo rabo (4ce)
Baby come to the floor (2ce)
Baby show too the floor (2ce)

Baby tell me what to do
I've been here since to two
Now l'm talking now, I'm confused
From your back, you look like toolz
Oya o oya o
Iwo lomo towari o
Ode dira modi me o
Sugbon moti cover bukata ye o

Emergency, emergency
You never see coming through (4ce)
Gbangba robo robo robo rabo
Baby come to the floor (2ce)
Baby show to the floor (2ce)
Emergency, emergency
You never see me coming through (4ce)
Baby come to the floor (2ce)
Baby show to the floor (2ce)
Gbangba robo robo robo rabo
