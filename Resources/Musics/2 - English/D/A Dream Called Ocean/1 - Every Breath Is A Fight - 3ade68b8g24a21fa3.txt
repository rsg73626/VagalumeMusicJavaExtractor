EVERY BREATH IS A FIGHT

We only haunt ourselves
Seeking bright calm and restful horizons
We ll all die
The goal is not to live forever

Maybe we have to break everything to make something out of ourselves

You have a choice live or die
Every breath is a fight
Live means following
Your own path

We can t stop trusting what used to make sense
And bring grace into these cold bodies
Like ghost sitting on the edge of human being motions
We only haunt ourselves seeking bright calm and restful horizons

And now it s up to you to save or to erase
Erasing what was gold, and we fall and we crawl, trying to ignore

I just don t wanna die without a few scars
The best way to fight it? just go
Every breath is a choice

You have a choice live or die
Every breath is a fight
Live means following
Your own path

And that sins and loves and fears are just sounds that fade away
We have to start teaching ourselves not being afraid
Everyday sunsets die.
