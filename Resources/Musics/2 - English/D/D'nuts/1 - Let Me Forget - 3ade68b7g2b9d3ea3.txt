LET ME FORGET

Why keep bad amounts?

So many fool memories
That sounds bad
Make me bad
Every time, more every time

Each day remembering
What I should forget
‘Cause (sometimes) it’s the best to do
It’s the best to forget

Let me forget
If I can choose
It seems so simple

Let me forget
But It’s not always like that
Today I know no one is perfect

You can change the present
But (you) can’t mix the past
And I come to say
I prefer to forget
I didn’t like the effect!

Am I always wrong?
