DEGENERATION-X

Are you ready?
You think you can tell us what to do
You think you can tell us what to wear
You think that you're better
Well you'd better get ready
Bow to the masters
Break it down!

DeGenerate into somethin fool
We just got tired of doing what you told us to do
That's the price boy
Yeaaah
That's the price little man
Break it down!

DeGeneration-X!!!
DeGeneration!!!

Think you can tell me what to do
You know who you're talking to?
Well you'd better get used to the way the ball bounces
I think what you got
It measures in ounces
Well that's the price boy
Yeaaah
That's the price little man
Break it down!

DeGeneration-X!!!
DeGeneration!!!

Think you're a big man?
I'll treat you like you're a little man

Yo tell me what it's like to be half a man
It must break your heart to see what I am, but
That's the price boy
Yeaaah
That's the price little man
Break it down!

DeGeneration-X!!!
DeGeneration!!!

Think you can tell me what to do
You know who you're talking to?

Just had to wanna be somebody else
Who can lean like a book on a shelf, but
You can read boy
Yeaaah
And you can read little man
