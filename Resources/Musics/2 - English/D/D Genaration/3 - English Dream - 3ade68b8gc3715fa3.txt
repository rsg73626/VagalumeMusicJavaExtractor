ENGLISH DREAM

I once had a dream
A feeling inside
A yearning so bad
you have to shout it out

Hey kid look at me
You can make it real
You can get it if you want

Hey you know When I first started out
They shut all the doors
But I laughed at all the doors
And I kicked them down

Here's my energy for you
Step into the light
while you still feel young

When I look in your eyes
And I reach for your hands
Well I'll do anything
To make you understand
That I'm still the seeker
For your English dreams
Don't you give up trying
And don't you let me down

The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down

Tell them

I look in your eyes
And I reach for your hands
Well I'll do anything
To help you understand
That I'm still the seeker
For your English dreams
Don't you
Don't you give up trying
And don't you let me down

The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
