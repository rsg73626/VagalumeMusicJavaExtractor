NO WAY OUT

From the alleys to the valleys
See 'em ridin' just like sally
When you wake up in the middle
And you just can't stay

I've seen the movies and the groovies
And i'm searching for a ruby
In the gutter with a promise
And i'm on my way

Send us all to high school
Make us pray to statues
So we hang on corners lookin' bored

All the rubbish that you cherish
With your hedonistic pleasures
And your latest status symbols
Just can't stay

Seen the majors chase the minors
With the military blinders
Dangle carrots in the faces
Of the u.s.a.

I hate the local stiffness
And all the capitol sickness
You know they're waiting on a war

Whisper in my ear dear
(tell me something)
Why does suicide have such appeal
(never nothin')
No way-goin'
Like sailors
And valentine
Failures
Ducking
Rejection with
Walls of
Protection

Degeneration
Cross the nation
Lonely callers masturbation
For a minute

Just can't stay
All the wheelers and the dealers
And the zombies kill the feelings
With a bottle and a vial
And i'm on my way

I seen my mother
Watch her dreams just
Smother

Don't wanna sing the graveyard song

Whisper in my ear dear
(tell me something)
Why do you pretend it ain't fucking real
(never nothin')
No way-heart felt attraction
That never takes action
Just meetings and functions
And social corruptions

All your niches and your stitches
I'm not lyin' back and wishin'
For a cinderella savior
And i just can't stay
Call us fags and call us phonies
But i make the ginamone
And you hate it cause i shake
It
And i'm on my way

I can't wait till christmas
Barking in the darkness
A broken hero at the bar

Whisper in my ear dear
(tell me something)
Why does suicide have such
Appeal
(never nothin')

No way out
No way out
No way now
No way!

Fire to ashes
And candy store flashes
Scars from the gashes
And yesterday passes

From the alleys to the
Valleys
See 'em ridin' just like sally
When you wake up and you
Just can't stay
