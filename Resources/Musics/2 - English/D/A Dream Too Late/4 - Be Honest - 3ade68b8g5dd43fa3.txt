BE HONEST

Oh, oh did you hear?
You hung me to dry standing right by your side
And I will be honest with you now, cause i know that you won't

Don't tell me I'm not for real
Can't tell me I'm not for real

Everything you promised me, then you throw it all away
You stabbed my back so you can say what you want to
Tell me where's your motive now?
Did you throw it all away?
You've lost my trust so you can say what you want

Oh, are you still there?
Or did you forget, pretend to disappear?
And I will be honest with you now
Cause I know that you won't

Don't tell me I'm not for real
Can't tell me I'm not for real

Everything you promised me, then you throw it all away
You stabbed my back so you can say what you want to
Tell me where's your motive now?
Did you throw it all away?
You've lost my trust so you can say what you want

Planets keep on turning, but the sun it stays the same
Come on you can keep running, but this love will never change
