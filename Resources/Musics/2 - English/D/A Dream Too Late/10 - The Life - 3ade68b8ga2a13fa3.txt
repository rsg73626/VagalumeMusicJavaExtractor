THE LIFE

Am I alive?
Is it breath that keeps me living in my lungs
So I can be strong?
Do I believe in you?
Do I believe that...

I want to change from the inside out

I'll give you the life, give you the life I live.

I don't wanna live without you
I know I can't escape the sun.
So I'll sing a new song
Do I believe in you?
Do I believe that...

I want to change from the inside out

I wont stop, can't ever stop the feeling
I wont stop, I'm not looking for a reason
But You

I want to change from the inside out
