14TH & KNOTT

The Sound of silence in the streets
Echo off the cars
The way everyone’s asleep seems to be the start
Of dreams wandering this town
Will never get you far

The time has come, The time to run

Do you remember? Do you remember
That the freeway takes you anyplace?
Just like this life can, Just like this life can
Take you anyplace
But I cant take you

Have you lost the motion in your heart
Because its been so long?
Since you walked out of the door
And learned to just move on from dreams
That never came around to being second best

The time has come, Its time you run

It’s a goodnight feeling
When summers leaving

It’s a goodnight feeling
With summer leaving

Do you remember? Do you remember
That the freeway takes you anyplace
Just like this life can, just like this life can
Take you anyplace
But I can’t take you
