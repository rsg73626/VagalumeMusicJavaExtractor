INTERMISSION TO THE MOON

Please, hear me call out loud
Hear me scream this sound
Its the only thing you'll hear

And it tells so cold
And i figure so
You'll figure out when you're here
Space is all you've got

Chorus:
You really only get one chance
You really only get one love
You really only get one fear
To fall

If you, want to go alone
Then it's all on you
And it goes control
Here with your fingers cold
And the shades of rose that will take you on

Chorus:
You really only get one chance
You really only get one love
You really only get one fear
To fall
You really only get one wish
You really only get one love
You really only get one time to find

Space is all you've got
Space is all you've got

Chorus:
You really only get one chance
You really only get one love
You really only get one fear
To fall
You really only get one wish
You really only get one love
You really only get one time to find
