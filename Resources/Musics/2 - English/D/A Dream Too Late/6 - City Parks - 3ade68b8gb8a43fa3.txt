CITY PARKS

My eyes have seen stranger things
So I dont wanna be the one you lost
Sometimes falling apart is the only way to
Seek the cost

I'm drifting off to space

And i'm singing out
These times are taking over my heart
You're the owner
But these times are taking over my heart

Space spans further away
all the planets seem to separate
Because love is moving away
And our lives begin to feel the same

I'm drifting off to space

And i'm singing out
These times are taking over my heart
You're the owner
But these times are taking over my heart

These times are taking over
Taking over my heart
I don't want to feel lost
Inside this City Park
You're the answer
Take the lonely right from my heart

And i'm singing out
These times are taking over my heart
You're the owner
But these times are taking over my heart

These times are taking over my heart
