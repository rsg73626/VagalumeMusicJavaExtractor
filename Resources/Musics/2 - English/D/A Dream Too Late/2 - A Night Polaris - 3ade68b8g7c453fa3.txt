A NIGHT POLARIS

If I reached the end would it ease my mind
To leave it with you?
And memory please remember me
Because you're all that I have

I can stand alone, if all on my own

Forget our names
Let's escape from this fading world
Run for cover
Run for cover

Don't watch this die
Save your eyes from this burning world
Run for cover
Run for cover

I wanna go, but there's no where to stay
Outside of your love.
And I have to live with the things that I say
But nothing is mine.

I can stand alone, if all on my own

Forget our names
Let's escape from this fading world
Run for cover
Run for cover

Don't watch this die
Save your eyes from this burning world
Run for cover
Run for cover
