DO YOU BELIEVE? (IN GHOSTS)

Stand Up, I just saw you
Like a shadow in the distance
Cautiously I slowly start to breath
Slowly taste you in the air

You're just a ghost
Invisible, you're just a ghost

Stand Up, because I'm not alone here
I can feel you floating through me
Should this be a new disease of me
Planning intoxication?
Cautiously I start to lose my feet
As you're breathing down my neck

You're just a ghost
Invisible, you're just a Ghost

I feel lost, when you're here
So suprising, how did you find me?
And all I want is the truth

You're just a ghost
Invisible, you're just a Ghost

I feel lost, when you're here
So suprising, how did you find me?
And all I want is the truth

But you're just a Ghost
