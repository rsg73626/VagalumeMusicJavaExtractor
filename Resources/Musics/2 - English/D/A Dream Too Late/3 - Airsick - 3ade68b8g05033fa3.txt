AIRSICK

This Road Seems longer as it takes me
Takes me further each day
Trying to get used to all these towns
But I'm not quite the same
So show me, show me what I'm missing
And what I can't see
And lead me, lead me to believe that
There's still a reason here to stay

Waking up to another mile while you're still back at home
Tracing my dreams keep holding on
I'll never feel alone
Wandering closer I know I'll make it
But how will I make it on my own?
It's coming in clear now,
As I'm getting airsick
I'll never make it on my own

I'm sick from breathing in this new air
Tastes like the time when I lost you
I don't know next time when I see you
Will we always fit the same?
I know there's something to be found here
Counting days away from you
But I'll take, take all of this in now
I need a chance to see this through

One shot is all that I'm seeing
Missing you is all that I'm breathing
Give or take, take it or leave it now
One shot is all that I'm seeing
Missing you is all that I'm breathing
Take it or leave it now

Waking up to another mile while you're still back at home
Tracing my dreams keep holding on
I'll never feel alone
Wandering closer I know I'll make it
but how will i make it on my own?
it's coming in clear now,
as I'm getting airsick
I'll never make it on my own
