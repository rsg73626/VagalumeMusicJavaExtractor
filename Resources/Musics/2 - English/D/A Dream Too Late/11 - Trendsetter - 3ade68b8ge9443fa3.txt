TRENDSETTER

You're rolling up in your Mercedes Benz
Full of your fake friends
They're laughing like they love you

You walk around just like you LA
With all your make up
Boys aren't supposed to wear that stuff

Do you think there could be somehting fortune cant buy?
Do you think love has something to do with it?

Trendsetter, Dance alone to your heart beat
Trendsetter, Trendsetter
Trendsetter, show me what I wanna be
Trendsetter, Trendsetter

You can't afford enough attention
To stay at number one
So just charge it to Mom's credit card

Getting gropped by all the freshman
But they can't touch you when
They find there nothing left inside

Do you think they will stay by your side?
Do you think theres something more to life than lies?

Trendsetter, dance alone to your heart beat
Trendsetter, Trendsetter
Trendsetter, show me what I wanna be
Trendsetter, Trendsetter

There's more To, There's More To Life

Trendsetter, you dance alone to your heart beat
Trendsetter, Take a look at yourself
All that's left is a ghost when you're somebody else
Trendsetter, you dance alone to your heartbeat
Trendsetter, take a look at yourself
All that's left Is a ghost
