CROSSES

I've closed, my eyes to stop
My tormented thoughts
From where came, these scars on my hands?
Have I lost my lucidity again?
An old lie, my best try
A burned picture of you falls shy
What was, the single word
That I couldn't understand?
So make it sure that I'll never come back
My heart still beating but I'm dead inside
Just let me make my own grave
With crosses in the way
Wasted my time in a light road by the stars
The flashes have blinded my selfish mind
A sick man cannot order anything
But take my hand just while the storm begin
We refuse to carry on
But nothing can stop the time
The natural course of things
You're just pretending to live
So make it sure that I'll never come back
My heart still beating but I'm dead inside
Just let me make my own grave
With crosses in the way
I've always make it the wrong way
But my love was for real
Maybe in another life, we can start again
With crosses in the way
