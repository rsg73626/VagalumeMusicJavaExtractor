BURN (THE CITY DOWN)

Years of repression, condensedin a handful of yellow pages
Victims of our own choices
We build our own cages
Old men dictate the rules
Mask of a false democracy
But them wear the holy sign
Centuries of a stupid legacy
Why did you still breathe?
After all you have done! (Burn, down!)
You gotta feel the rage, breaking every single bone!
(Burn, down!)
Where will you hide now? Your last hope has gone!
(Burn, down!)
You gotta feel the rage, breaking every single bone!
And let the people burn the city down!
Let the people burn the city down!
A young man chops his breakfastin a mirror
white as the virgin
A little child wants to learn by
Another homeless that's living in
Shreds of dreams
Latent open sore
Rip your papers and your racist rules
'Cause here it won't be no more!
Why did you still breathe?
After all you have done! (Burn, down!)
You gotta feel the rage, breaking every single bone!
(Burn, down!)
Where will you hide now? Your last hope has gone!
(Burn, down!)
You gotta feel the rage, breaking every single bone!
And let the people burn the city down! Let the people
burn the city down!
Yeah!
And let the people burn the city down!
Let the people burn the city down!
