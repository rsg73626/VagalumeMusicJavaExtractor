STORIES THAT I ALREADY KNEW

Hey, hey, baby, what are you looking around?
Creepy frozen spirits and creatures unbound
Things we do in half-shade
People make their price to feel insane 
And the guiles inside your lies
Now turn dust before our eyes
Just like kids playing a game
So what do you think, about this shame?
We are dancing the same old music
Watching that sleeping drama movie
Don't try to fix the aerialswhat's out there is secret
And mysterious
Far beyond of what you see
Everything you want of me
Please don't tell me what I already knew
Feel this burning inside of you
This place is full of sins, you claim
But nobody wants to play
Your silky thighs and hot spots
Softly denouncing your thoughts
They are sweating, calling my hands
That's your mind, understand?
When your lips whisper my name
Magic words light on a flame
We are dancing the same old music
Watching that sleeping drama movie
Don't try to fix the aerials
What's out there is secret and mysterious
Far beyond of what you see
Everything you want of me
Please don't tell me what I already knew
Feel this burning inside of you
We are dancing the same old music
Watching that sleeping drama movie
Don't try to fix the aerials
What's out there is secret and mysterious
Far beyond of what you see
Everything you want of me
Please don't tell me what I already knew
Feel this burning inside of you
