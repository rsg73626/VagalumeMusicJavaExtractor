KILL YOUR DYING

Another phantom village, what the past have done?
That every man built and gone
Said the mayor that would prosper
Said the beggars, the devil's own sampler

Have to heal my mind, strayed
Maybe is the right time to die
My dreams turn on nightmares and
My gapes are like death traps, oh yeah
Ghosts, beasts, freaks, demons, dozen in a dash
I can't believe on what was living in my flesh
Can't run 'cause everywhere they hide
I can't save what's already mine
Lay down as they cross the edge

I'm afraid of what you'll say
And I know what is coming, that's how I kill your dying
And the pleasure surrounds my fear
The old man stands again at the road
Telling the stories that once have been told
Is now for you and me to enjoy

Have to heal my mind, strayed
Maybe is the right time to die
My dreams turn on nightmares and
My gapes are like death traps, oh yeah
Ghosts, beasts, freaks, demons, dozen in a dash
I can't believe on what was living in my flesh
Can't run 'cause everywhere they hide
I can't save what's already mine
Lay down as they cross the edge
I'm afraid of what you'll say

And I know what is coming, that's how I kill your dying
Just sit and wait while the night fall before us
The cold and mourns take me to madness
Save the screams, try to save a breath
All we must be dead when hush revolve the tears
Ghosts, beasts, freaks, demons, dozen in a dash
I can't believe on what was living in my flesh
Can't run 'cause everywhere they hide
I can't save what's already mine
Lay down as they cross the edge
I'm afraid of what you'll say,  
And I know what is coming, that's how I kill your dying!
