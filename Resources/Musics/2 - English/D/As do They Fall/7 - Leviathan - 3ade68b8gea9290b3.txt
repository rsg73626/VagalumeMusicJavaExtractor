LEVIATHAN

There comes the darkest storm
The one that comes just to destroy
2feeding on other people's dreams
Taking their peace, controlling their sins
He don't hear any of your claims
Enslaving souls in a dirty lie
Keeping blind those who can't see
Infection on humankind
I hid my tears to show them more
The razor's edge decides your fate
We cannot take this anymore
Anymore!
I hid my tears to show them more
The thin line of life
Our screams will echo for evermore
Evermore!
Struck with the strenght of an angel
Shout with the voice of a demon
Blood bathed the seas
And his eyes burned the earth
No hell below
Will stop your fall!
No hell below
Will be painful like this!
I hid my tears to show them more
The razor's edge decides your fate
We cannot take this anymore
Anymore!
I hid my tears to show them more
The thin line of life
Our screams will echo for evermore
Evermore!
No hell below!
