NEMESIS

Ten thousands reasons, reasons to give up
A burned book of shattered words
There's no clowns to testify
The tricks you make with your tongue
Are your nostrils white?  
I don't remember giving you my flour
The darkness, the infinity, the ocean and the unseen
You're hunting rabbits, seeking the primal chaos
I'll be your master before you seei am your Nemesis, your wannabe
When light finally goes off
Your madness is calling me
I am your Nemesis!
Take a look belowi am your Nemesis!
Let your inner Ankh to flow
You try to escape, I flank you ahead
You try hide up, my jackals catch you behind
Your tears glow in reflection of emerald
But in the end you really love it"One more, one more barmaid!
My friends inside want to have a real good timei think that
whore deserve some inches of pleasure
Give her a cookie, with some fucking dope! "
I'll be your master before you seei am your Nemesis, your wannabe
When light finally goes offyour madness is calling me
I am your Nemesis! Take a look belowi am your Nemesis!
Let your inner Ankh to flow
I am your Nemesis! Take a look below... I am your Nemesis!
Let your inner Ankh to flow!
I am your Nemesis! (Oh no, oh yeah?) I am your Nemesis! (Oh!)
