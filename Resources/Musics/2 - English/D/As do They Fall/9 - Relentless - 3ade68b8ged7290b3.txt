RELENTLESS

Feeding the minds with venom and opium
Our justice is rotten, it roots are cut downit can't be this way
I'm not gonna take itit can't be this way, we gonna make it
They claim to be the saviors
Lies in the name of the holy
Promises of better days
Schizophrenics dogs barking stupidly
You fucking putrid scum!
We are the owners of the world
We are the final act of the show
A relentless force about to blow
A beautiful story of repression
Your tragic ending of depression
Blood in the streets and fire in the sky
We? re all making 'till the flame is alive
They don't understand, what I'm trying to say
They don't want to see, what I'm trying to show
Suits selling our false image to the world
We won't be glad, until this cancer explode
We are the owners of the world
We are the final act of the show
A relentless force about to blow
We came in the silence of the night
We gonna struggle to make this right
We are the ones that don't flee the fight
We are the owners of the world
We are the final act of the show
A relentless force about to blow
We came in the silence of the night
We gonna struggle to make this right
We are the ones that don't flee the fight
