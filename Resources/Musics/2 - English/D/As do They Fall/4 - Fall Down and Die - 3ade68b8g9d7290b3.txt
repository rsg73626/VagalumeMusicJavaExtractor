FALL DOWN AND DIE

I see those rats on the avenue
Drowning back into the grey concrete
Tears of glass in the coffee cups
Smoking menthol cigarettes, asphyxiated
Can't you understand the factor?
I always do it like an actor
Money, easily making some more
And I know why have I came for
Fall down and die
Fall down and die
What a beautiful lie
Fall down and die
So tell me, my good friend
What's your real big sin?
With a good sharp, you gotta realize
How you are a good pile of bullshit
They find in an old book
A key that cannot open anything
We are all going to freak out
We're all freaking hell out!
Fall down and die
Fall down and die
What a beautiful lie
Fall down and die
I'm here to scream I'm here to tell you
I'm fucking right here
I'm fucking right here!
Fall down and die
Fall down and die
What a beautiful liefall down and die
