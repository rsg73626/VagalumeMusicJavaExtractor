TRIPPING ROAD THE CREW

The night came and is Saturday
But I can't even remember yesterday
We're looking for some action
We pray for satisfaction
Ohh, we can ride away
Make some fun to turn into money
Ohh, we can make the way
we aretripping Road Crew on the highway
The Devil has invited me for a long night
I bet too much high, but it's all right
Your chance is so near 
Don't trust anything you hear
Ohh, we can ride away
Make some fun to turn into money
Ohh, we can make the way
we aretripping Road Crew on the highway
Ohh, we can ride away
Make some fun to turn into money (haha!)
Ohh, we can make the way
we aretripping Road Crew on the highway!
(I can? t hear you motherfuckers!)
