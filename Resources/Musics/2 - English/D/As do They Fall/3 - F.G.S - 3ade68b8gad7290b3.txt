F.G.S

We just started this shit!  
You asked me for everything
So latent, your desire burned inside
Things went bad to your side
Slowly my words caught her body
Like a hurricane, shake for me baby
Your pain is just part of our pleasure
For a little girl, you gone too far
So let your deepest desire
Take it over and light the fire
You're such an angel, baby
Mess my thoughts, take care of my mind
Turn your head, I want to look at your eyes
Let this flame burn to outside
This is madness, I've told you
Let's enjoy, start the fight
Take off your clothes, you don't need them
Take a breath and come back here
Your blonde hair smells so fucking good
You gonna make me lose my reason
Yeah! Here we are again!
Are you sweating cold?
Don't fear, honey, I'm just gonna hurt a littleit has no limits
not for you
Use your mouth, not too fast
Your poison flows making me crazy
Her mother said not to trust strangers
But it seems we've met enough
So let your deepest desire
Take it over and light the fire
You're such an angel, baby
Mess my thoughts, take care of my mind
Turn your head, I want to look at your eyes
Let this flame burn to outside
This is madness, I've told you
Let's enjoy, start the fight
No excuses for you
Your naughty little whore!
No excuses for you
You knew that before!
No excuses for you
Your naughty little whore!
No excuses for you
You knew that before!
