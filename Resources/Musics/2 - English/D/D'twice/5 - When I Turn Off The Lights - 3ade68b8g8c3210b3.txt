WHEN I TURN OFF THE LIGHTS

Yeah, listen girl

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
Baby! This is so good to me
I wanna know, what you feel

A glass of wine and your favorite song
The night is like a child, so come on!
And you need not fear, I'll be here...

When I turn off the lights!
When I turn off the lights
When I turn off the lights!
When I turn off the lights (2x)

When I turn off the lights
Turn off the lights! (background vocal)
Turn off the lights
Turn off the lights! (background vocal)

Turn off the lights...

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
Baby! This is so good to me
I wanna know, what you feel

A glass of wine and your favorite song
The night is like a child, so come on!
And you need not fear, I'll be here...

When I turn off the lights!
When I turn off the lights
When I turn off the lights!
When I turn off the lights (2x)

When I turn off the lights
Turn off the lights! (background vocal)
Turn off the lights
Turn off the lights! (background vocal)

Turn off the lights...

When I turn off the lights
