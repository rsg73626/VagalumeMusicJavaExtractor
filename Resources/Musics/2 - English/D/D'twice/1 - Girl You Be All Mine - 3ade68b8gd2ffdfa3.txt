GIRL YOU BE ALL MINE

Closer
I want you here
Baby! nothing will change that will of love

You are my best day
You are my safe harbor
And all that is in us
Makes me want more of this love

All me
You are all I need
And at that moment
Girl you be all mine

Under the moonlight
See the sunrise
And at that moment
Girl you be all mine

Your love
For me
All day long
And I want that at me
Your love...
