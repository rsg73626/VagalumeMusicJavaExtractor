GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AGAIN

(intro1)
Hey love!
I need to talk to you
And this is very important to me
So far I dont know what happened
Everything was wonderful with us
Suddenly everything changed
I know I'm not perfect
But you're perfect for me
So I want you always by my side
You make me so happy
You are all I have girl
You're all I need girl
Please, give us another chance
Bring your love back to me

(estrofe1)
Girl, I wanna to talk
Everything I'm feeling without you
And dont make me stop
Not me, but my heart is crying for you
Girl I'm so lonly
Girl I miss you
And now I want you back for me

Girl every night
Miss your body by my side
This is very hard
I made several plans for our future
Girl I need you
Girl I see you
And now I want you back for me

(refrão)
Give me your love again 3x
Because I still could not understand

(intro2)
Hey love
I know things are not good
But you know we had happy times
Relationship is like that
A day is good and the other is bad
But this is not what is making me sad
Which makes me sad, is not having you by my side more
But I'm willing to change the game
Because I love you
Because I need you
Cause I miss you
Because you're all I need girl
Please bring your love back
C'mon!!!

(estrofe2)
Girl
We're wasting time
I love you and I know you love me too
We'll meet tonight?
A chat and relax
And recall
Girl I see you
Girl I need you
And now I want you back for me

Girl
Dont fight this love
He is pure and true, you can be sure!
What god has joined,
No one can separate
Girl I'm lonly
Girl I miss you
And now I want you back for me

(refrão)
Give me your love again 3x
Because I still could not understand

(coro final)
I need your love
I need you for me
Girl I want u know
Bring your love back to me
