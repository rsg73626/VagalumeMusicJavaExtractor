MEMORIES REMAIN

Suffering for all this time, I’ve slowly died inside.
These bleeding wounds have not yet healed
and I can’t escape the pain.
Now I need to find the strength to leave it all behind.
My past won’t be my fate and my scars won’t hold me down.
I have to save myself.
Memories, they haut my life,
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide,
trapped again in my own hell,
I face the truth alone, when all is said and done,
you can’t keep looking back.
So, dry those tears and wish the pain away...
