SURREAL ATROCITIES

the damage has been done
listen to the cries of turmoil
as the day continues to rain
you can hear the vocal violence
silence the crowd
words fall short of sound
as the loudest of men
becom speechless
lack of breath
is what swept me away
as i wallow
helpless in this surreal atrocity
with night approaching
we all become vulnerable
everything seems to move slower
as time drifts apathetically
to great the dawn
as the new day begins
the effort to live becomes none
