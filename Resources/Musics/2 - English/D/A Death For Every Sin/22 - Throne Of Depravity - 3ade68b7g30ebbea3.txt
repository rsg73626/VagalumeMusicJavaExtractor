THRONE OF DEPRAVITY

Burn their gods this false legacy I won't celebrate faceless icons painted black bane of the deranged distorted images....abominations treacherous portrait of truth callous throne of the wicked destined to rust and decay dehumanized existence is worthless kill the will of the father for it is soiled with the blood of its victims innocents doomed and misled from the beginning by vicars of sickness under a godless sky we're left to rot and to die I won't celebrate faceless icons painted black.
