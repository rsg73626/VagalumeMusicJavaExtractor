FILLED WITH SORROW

We are born alone damned and frail searching to lift this curse of despair a cureless disease that bring only pain to those that have been betrayed and scarred left devoid of love another desecrated soul now walks this earth suffering and dying in loneless all that is left memories, lost innocent all that is left stripped of life those left behind have nothing but their shattered hopes and broken dreams all that is left memories, lost innocent all that is left...are these bleeding wounds of despair relinquish in sadness.
