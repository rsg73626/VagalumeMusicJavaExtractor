ETERNALLY DAMNED

Ostracized by the disciples of a dark empire by deamons dressed in white staying the infidels spreading lies bringers of death and horror quenching their sadistic thirst for blood a quest that made this land a mass grave still the chorus of pleas and remain unheard demanding justice for the crimes committed against their people for the memories of those mourned they shall seek vengeance retribution for the martyrs of this world vengeance now judgement's coming pray for the last time and gasp for your last breath.
