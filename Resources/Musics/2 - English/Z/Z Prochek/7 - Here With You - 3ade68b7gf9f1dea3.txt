HERE WITH YOU

From the pain that built my life 
You can take it piece by piece 
Hide it from the voice inside 
Speak to me 
Fractions of the things that passed 
Are telling me to always stay inside 
Stay inside this place forever here 
Me and you, protected from defeat 

Filled my life with thoughts of you and hope 
To be here with you and hold you tight tonight 

Never ending 
Like a lie 
Feels so distant 
All must die 
Nothing in this hollow world is real 
And one time you will forget the fear 
I will say farewell to dying stars 
Greet new friends and kill the things that passed 
Let me end the world 
To see you fade away 

Filled my life with thoughts of you and hope 
To be here with you and hold you tight tonight
