THE ONE

Dark metallic machinery 
Moving backwards 
Counting steps 
Great cynic industry 
The sacred land will never be 

Given life to program fate 
I reject all you gave 
Earning trust behind the screen 
I am one, I can't be seen 

Even though my hands are stained 
You will let me guide the way 
To the vortex of despair 
If you fail no will care 

Given life to program fate 
I reject all you gave 
Earning trust behind the screen 
I am one, I can't be seen
