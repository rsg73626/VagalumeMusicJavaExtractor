IN DESPAIR

Rage awakening deep inside of me 
Making me aware 
To set my feelings free 
What used to be concealed is now brought up 
Visibly taking over me 
When I see what you are doing 
Something's growing frightening me 
I can't hold it for much longer 
Stop your actions immediately 

Step aside 
Do your best to make up to what you have done 
Then I'll be sending your petition for mercy 
Spare me my anger and maybe I will find a way 
To forgive you for proving such disrespect 
I have seen it for a long time 
I've been indulgent with my eyes shut 
I can't hold this for much longer 
I have tired of this proven fact 

Step aside 
Do your best to make up to what you have done 
Then I'll be sending your petition for mercy 
Spare me my anger and maybe I will find a way 
To forgive you for proving such disrespect 
I have seen it for a long time 
I've been indulgent with my eyes shut 
I can't hold this for much longer 
I have tired of this proven fact
