SKIN

You hit me with your eyes 
You defeat me with your smile 
You face me with your looks 
And make me very weak 
You slam me down with your bare presence 
And do you know 
At the time you make me feel so alive 

Forget about the things that I do have got 
Forget about the things that I have to loose 
My mind is a mess 
And I know I want more 
More of you 
That's what I'm longing for 

Seeking reasons not to get even closer 
Not to go pass the line 
Common sense is expired by now 
I shouldn't need to be in disguise 
Searching myself 
Finding my heart belongs there 
No matter what I've got 
This is what you have done to me 
My heart is now in your hands 

Is this just a way to escape my daily round 
An attempt to leave this some what unfortunate path 
Will this take me further 
Or simply bring me down 
This probably will cause me more pain than joy 
Just by being around you're making my day 
Satisfying my heart 
And giving me reasons to stay 
As long as I see you 
I will stay pleased 
I will stay the same 
Loosing myself more and more each day 

Seeking reasons not to get even closer 
Not to go pass the line 
Common sense is expired by now 
I shouldn't need to be in disguise 
Searching myself 
Finding my heart belongs there 
No matter what I've got 
This is what you have done to me 
My heart is now in your hands 

Seeking reasons not to go pass the line 
Searching, finding no matter what I've got 
My heart is now in your hands 
I shouldn't need to be in disguise
