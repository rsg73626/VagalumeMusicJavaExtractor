BEHIND THE SCREEN

Like any other picture flashing by 
We see blood and tears 
We've been used to it for some time 
It is now part of us 
Like any of those former made up worlds 
The screen is filled with our interpretation 
Who will prove this truly is for real 
Are we damaged by our fantasy 

Out of our range 
Outside of our views 
Real lives are taken away 
As we're here in the seamy side 
As we're here behind the soothing screen 

Suffering beyond our imagination 
It seems far away 
Too distant to be real 
We think we have been there done that through our pain 
We are not too knowing 
Not too knowing 
Lives are being taken away 
Evil arise 
Our absence makes it all continue 
Continue without our opinion 
Continue without our support 

Out of our range 
Outside of our views 
Real lives are taken away 
As we're here in the seamy side 
As we're here behind the soothing screen

Who'll be there to console the ones who're in desperate need 
In need for our help
