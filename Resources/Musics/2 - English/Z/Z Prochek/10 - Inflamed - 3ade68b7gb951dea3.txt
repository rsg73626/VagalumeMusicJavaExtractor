INFLAMED

Walk the streets 
Feel the pulse 
See the fake human race 
Walking dreamer I laugh at you 
Walking dreamer you’re in my way 
So many ways 
So many styles 
Poor little thing get out of my sight 
Seek the colors of your life 
Find the answers to make it right 

I cannot feel the light, I can… 
Divide the future from the past 
I cannot feel the light, I can… 
Separate the colors from the light 

Feel the beats of my heart 
Tell the rage from my scars 
Walking dreamer I laugh at you 
Walking dreamer you’re in my way 
So many days 
So many lies 
Poor little thing get out of my sight 
Seek the colors of your life 
Find the answers to make it right 

I cannot feel the light, I can… 
Divide the future from the past 
I cannot feel the light, I can… 
Separate the colors from the light

Don't don't you fear the future 
Don't you fear the light 
Divide the future from the past 
Separate the colors the light
