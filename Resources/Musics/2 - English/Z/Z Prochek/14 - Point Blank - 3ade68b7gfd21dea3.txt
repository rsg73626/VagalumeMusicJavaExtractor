POINT BLANK

Inhale 
The essence of pure life 
And focus on everything that’s right 
Exhale 
The darkness that you fear 
To make the mind 
Become all clear 

Falling to the ground tonight 
My whole life passing by my eyes 
The future takes it course 
You cannot comprehend the truth 

Falling to the ground tonight 
My whole life passing by my eyes 
The future takes it course 
You cannot comprehend the truth

Ready to encounter truth 
I trusted you what I can do 
And in the line with what is left 
Torn to pieces by regrets 
And in line with what is left 
Torn to pieces by regrets 
Coming down on me and you 
And I don’t know what to do 

Falling to the ground tonight 
My whole life passing by my eyes 
The future takes it course 
You cannot comprehend the truth
