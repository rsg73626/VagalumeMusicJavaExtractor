MEMORIES

Why? Don’t crawl 
Why? Don’t fall 
All my hatred 
Is for you 
When you lie 
I see right through 
Eye for an eye 
Live in a lie for me 

Eye for an eye 
You live in a lie for me 
I cannot take that you're alive 
Open your door 
And come out so I can see 
See your face 

This my friend 
Is what you get 
Endless pain 
Fucked up head 
You will hang 
On sinners cross 
You will get 
Your tongue cut off 

Eye for an eye 
You live in a lie for me 
I cannot take that you're alive 
Open your door 
And come out so I can see 
See your face
