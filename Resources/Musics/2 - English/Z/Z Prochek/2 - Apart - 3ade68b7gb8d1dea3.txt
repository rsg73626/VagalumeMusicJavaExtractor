APART

It was never my idea to send those troops 
It was never my will to start a war 
It was never my mind to cause you this pain 
It was never my sign on the paper 
It was never my words to announce this 
So who gave you permission to take my life 

Do you think you rule me 
My ways 
My every will 
Does this very soul belong to you as well 
Do you think you rule me 
Perhaps I'm just a walking dummy 
So who gave you this permission to take my life 

In the seamy side we are put down 
And there is nothing we can do 
Only watching these diseased acts of man 

Do you think you rule me 
My ways 
My every will 
Does this very soul belong to you as well 
Do you think you rule me 
Perhaps I'm just a walking dummy 
So who gave you this permission to take my life
