TREAD THE BOARDS

Let us stay presented 
Let us raise our voice 
Let us show our inside 
And do the right thing 
Defeat your inner fear 
To get somewhere tonight 
Know that you are better 
Than words can declare 

Let us show ourselves 
Let us show ourselves 
Take my hand and 
Let us walk into the crowd of 
People longing for more 
Join hands 
Join hearts 
Join your voices 

Let your heart decide 
What ever is right 
Don't you trust your mind 
It is often there to blind 
Find out what you're really 
Really looking for 
Take the opportunity 
Your one single chance 

Come with me and 
Together let's do what ever is needed 
Come with me and together let's reunite 
In a way we've never done before 

Let us show ourselves 
Let us show ourselves 
Take my hand and 
Let us walk into the crowd of 
People longing for more 
Join hands 
Join hearts 
Join your voices 

And we're longing for more
