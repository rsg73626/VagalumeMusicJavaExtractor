HEAL

They were not there 
Just a mirror full of lies 
Reflecting your reality 
They will not show 
So frightened to reveal 
What makes me heal 
What makes me real 
What makes me heal 
Looking out 
Pull the curtains down 
Nothing to see 
Wear my stinky gown 
Yet another day 
Yet another smile 
Yet another victim 
To scratch from the tile 

They were not there 
Just a mirror full of lies 
Reflecting your reality 
They will not show 
So frightened to reveal 
What makes me heal 

They promised to come 
Promised to seek you 
Up and down 
Fooled us all around 

They were not there 
Just a mirror full of lies 
Reflecting your reality 
They will not show 
So frightened to reveal 
What makes me heal 

What makes me heal 
What makes me real
