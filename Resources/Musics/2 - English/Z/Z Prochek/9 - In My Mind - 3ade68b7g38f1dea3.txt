IN MY MIND

Saving grace while full of pain and hate 
To be me 
And looking for a way to find myself 
To feel free 
But i rot in my cell of guilt 
Walk the path of fading souls 
Dusk is closing in on me 
Erasing my identity 

I see the markings on your skin 
I hear the voices deep within 
I can not see the face I fear 
I know the end is near 
This time the darkness will be seen 
This time my concience will be clean 
I can not see your face 
I know the end is near 

Feelings stain your face in dark blue shade 
Caving in 
And in my mind i think of you as dead 
We will fall 
Leaving broken hope in all you touch 
As a gift 
And we're lost - as it seems 
In this dream - let me be 

I see the markings on your skin 
I hear the voices deep within 
I can not see the face I fear 
I know the end is near 
This time the darkness will be seen 
This time my concience will be clean 
I can not see your face 
I know the end is near
