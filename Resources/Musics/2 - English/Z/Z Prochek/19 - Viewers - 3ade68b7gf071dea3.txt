VIEWERS

I see you are watching just like I am 
Though we all work so differently 
You belong to the mighty core 
At the peak of your career 
You know, you should be satisfied 
Equipped with everything that's right 
Still I can see the longing in your eyes 

I am but the outsider 
Admiring what you posess 
So why this focusing on what you haven't got 

I wish to add more joy 
More lasting joy 
I wish to heal souls 
To release souls into life 
Is there any way for viewers to find what's really inside 
Is there any way for viewers to find true happiness 

We are all viewers wanting more 
We are all unsatisfied 
Never happy too stay 
It gets too much of this daily round 
So this agony we apply 
Does it cause us even more 
Or is it just a way of our nature 
A way of our kind 

I wish to add more joy 
More lasting joy 
I wish to heal souls 
To release souls into life 
Is there any way for viewers to find what's really inside 
Is there any way for viewers to find true happiness
