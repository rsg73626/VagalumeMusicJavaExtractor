AVENGE

Prejudiced souls 
Now step away 
You have caused too much already 
You're about to go down 
If you don't end this here and now 
Hateful ones 
Just say goodbye 
Unmask yourselves 
It's time to face the ultimate price 
For your actions 

You were judging me 
You were judging them 
For not being you 
Are you happy with yourself 
As you're apparently never pleased 
And I know life will go on 
Yours will too 
But you'll never really live 
Cause your hearts are blank 
Cause your minds are all corrupted 

Fearful ones 
Your predetermining thoughts 
Will not bother no more 
Your time is up 
Your sorry minds will be isolated 
Taken away 
We'll let you drown in your fear 
We'll let you die in your lack of knowledge 
You had your chance 
Like I had mine 
Who are you to judge me anyway 

You were judging me 
You were judging them 
For not being you 
Are you happy with yourself 
As you're apparently never pleased 
And I know life will go on 
Yours will too 
But you'll never really live 
Cause your hearts are blank 
Cause your minds are all corrupted
