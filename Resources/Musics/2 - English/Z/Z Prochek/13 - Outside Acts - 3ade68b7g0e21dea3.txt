OUTSIDE ACTS

Be your prisoner inside of the safe field 
Never let your dreams be in your way 
Dying just hold on to what has passed 
Don't let anyone know who you are 
Be the passenger of the ever sinking ship 
Lock yourself up 
Don't let anyone know 

Just stop 
Let ages pass without you 
Just be forgotten like you never were there 
Remain in ashes, in our minds 
Never let the future get to know you 

Leave your presence to the random 
Lay down as you are no one to be seen 
Trust the fearing people in your past 
Let them all be right 
Leave no trace behind you when you're gone 
Make sure no one will get to know who's inside 

Just stop 
Let ages pass without you 
Just be forgotten like you never were there 
Remain in ashes, in our minds 
Never let the future get to know you

Were you ever there 
Is this the way you want to live your life
