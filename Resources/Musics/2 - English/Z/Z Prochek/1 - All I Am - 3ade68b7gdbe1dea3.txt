ALL I AM

Breathing calmly 
Watching gently 
My days falling apart 
As I see you passing by 
Tearing my eyes 
Nobody matters now 
I'm in this hibernation 

This is all I am 
You made me see 
Now go be proud of your work 
This is all I am to you 
It's all I deserve 
I know you will not wait forever 
For me to arrive 
And that's why I'm in this breakdown 
Knowing too much 

All the words to remember 
I repeat to myself 
While listening to the echoing heartbeats 
I heard it all 
I saw it all 
No need to hide from what you know 
This is what I am now 
And still you're in my sight 

Your work is done 

This is all I am 
You made me see 
Now go be proud of your work 
This is all I am to you 
It's all I deserve 
I know you will not wait forever 
For me to arrive 
And that's why I'm in this breakdown 
Knowing too much 

I'm here because of you 
You made me see 
Now go be proud of your work 
This is all I am to you 

Your work is done 
Now leave me alone
ALL I AM

Breathing calmly 
Watching gently 
My days falling apart 
As I see you passing by 
Tearing my eyes 
Nobody matters now 
I'm in this hibernation 

This is all I am 
You made me see 
Now go be proud of your work 
This is all I am to you 
It's all I deserve 
I know you will not wait forever 
For me to arrive 
And that's why I'm in this breakdown 
Knowing too much 

All the words to remember 
I repeat to myself 
While listening to the echoing heartbeats 
I heard it all 
I saw it all 
No need to hide from what you know 
This is what I am now 
And still you're in my sight 

Your work is done 

This is all I am 
You made me see 
Now go be proud of your work 
This is all I am to you 
It's all I deserve 
I know you will not wait forever 
For me to arrive 
And that's why I'm in this breakdown 
Knowing too much 

I'm here because of you 
You made me see 
Now go be proud of your work 
This is all I am to you 

Your work is done 
Now leave me alone
