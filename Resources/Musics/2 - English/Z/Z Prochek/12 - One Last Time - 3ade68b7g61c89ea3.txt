ONE LAST TIME

All this sorrow in my mind
Acting weird, I am just fine
Pulls me closer to the edge
Makes me wish that I was dead
Silent rain that falls on me
From a God that failed to see
All the good things where I stand
Always slipped right through my hands

Of all the times this is the last
Nothing matters but the past
Disapproves my right to live
Fills me up until I can't feel

All the chances that I had
Never knew I did this bad
Blew up all what's left inside
Produced another sorrows' tide
Cannot choose to wait alone
You know it hurts me to the bone
Cannot choose to let you go
What I need is all of you

Of all the times this is the last
Nothing matters but the past
Disapproves my right to live
Fills me up until I can't feel
