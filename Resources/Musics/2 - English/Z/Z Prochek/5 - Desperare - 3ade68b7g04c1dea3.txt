DESPERARE

Summer’s dying, see the end 
Changing seasons brings the rain 
From the skies once again 
I want to live 
I walk alone fear the end 
Fear the answers where’s our God? 
We used to pray to… 

Chorus: 
I have nothing left to say 
I have nothing left to feel 
The voice inside my heart is gone 
I have nothing left to say 
Nothing left to feel 

Nowhere else to go
DESPERARE

Summer’s dying, see the end 
Changing seasons brings the rain 
From the skies once again 
I want to live 
I walk alone fear the end 
Fear the answers where’s our God? 
We used to pray to… 

Chorus: 
I have nothing left to say 
I have nothing left to feel 
The voice inside my heart is gone 
I have nothing left to say 
Nothing left to feel 

Nowhere else to go
