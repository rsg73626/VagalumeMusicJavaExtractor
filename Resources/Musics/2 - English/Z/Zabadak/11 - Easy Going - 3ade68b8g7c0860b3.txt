EASY GOING

Maybe I will kill if war begins
It's easy going cause easy going
Maybe I will steal if I am hungry
It's easy going cause easy going

Maybe I will sell my friends to survive
Oh I am afraid I am afraid of it
Maybe I will tell a lie to you other than fight
It's easy going cause easy going

Everybody's talking everybody's thinking
Naturely we are especially
Everybody's funky like a tiny monkey
It's so silly don't you realize
Oh sorry oh sorry people tryin' to live in a pattern
Oh baby oh baby I want to be so special to you

Men in gray suits are powerful in town
There's no talkin' there's no laughin'
Before I know it's changing all around
It's so uncanny so uncanny

Everybody's talking everybody's thinking
Naturely we are especially
Everybody's funky like a tiny monkey
It's so silly don't you realize
Oh sorry oh sorry people tryin' to live in a pattern
Oh baby oh baby I want to be so special to you

Everybody's talking everybody's thinking
Naturely we are especially
Everybody's funky like a tiny monkey
It's so silly don't you realize
Oh sorry oh sorry people tryin' to live in a pattern
Oh baby oh baby I want to be so special to you

Everybody's talking everybody's thinking
Naturely we are especially
Everybody's funky like a tiny monkey
It's so silly don't you realize
Oh sorry oh sorry people tryin' to live in a pattern
Oh baby oh baby I want to be so special to you

Everybody's talking everybody's thinking
Naturely we are especially
Everybody's funky like a tiny monkey
It's so silly don't you realize
Oh sorry oh sorry people tryin' to live in a pattern
Oh baby oh baby I want to be so special to you
