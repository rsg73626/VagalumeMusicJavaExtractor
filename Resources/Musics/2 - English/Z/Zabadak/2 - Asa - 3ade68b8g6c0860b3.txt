ASA

In the early morning
Who will knock your window?
It's a pretty little thing
A pretty little thing
It makes you love, ooh everything

When the moonlight shines so bright
To fry you to the wonderland
Take a chance to make a friend
Don't ever be afraid
And all your dream will come true

Bye to all
The time will come
Bye to all
You wave your hand
To all those things and sweetst days
When you find out there's no fairyland

La la la
Bye to all
The time will come
Bye to all
You wave your hand
To all those things and sweetst days
When you find out there's no fairyland

In the early morning
Who will knock your window?
It's a pretty little thing
A pretty little thing
It makes you love, ooh everything
