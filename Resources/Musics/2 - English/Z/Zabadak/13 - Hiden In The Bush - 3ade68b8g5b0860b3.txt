HIDEN IN THE BUSH

One day, when I woke up
I didn't know if it's daylight or twilight
In a flurry I open the window
The air full of people's signs surged
I shouted, in bearfoot
I shouted into the street
"Please don't set monday's sun!
I haven't yet finished my morning
Kiss to you! "
A stranger went by tilting his head

Da di di da da di di da... (hide in the bush!)
Please come and take me luna!
I don't feel affection towerd anything
Please come and call me luna!
But the moon has gone behind the heavy clouds

One day, when I woke up
The air was coloured by my gloom
In a flurry. I took out my colours
But gloom was blended in them
But I smiled, with a light heart
I greeted a passerby
"Your smiling face so cold!
I have never seen such an ugly face! "
A stranger went by tilting his head

Da di di da da di di da... (hide in the bush!)
Please come and take me luna!
I don't feel affection towerd anything
Please come and call me luna!
But the moon has gone behind the heavy clouds
