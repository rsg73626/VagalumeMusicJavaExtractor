LA FATE

The old fishrman came back from the sea
He walks heavy steps to his old town
I know him well, scarcely he will talk
But I don't know the treasures of his mind
In-youth the fishrman survived heavy storms
Drifting for one week, he reached unknown land
I know him well, scarcely he will talk
And I know the tales of winterland

I (don't know) want (to know) how (to go)
I (want to) go to winterland
Let (me know) how (to go) let (me see)
How (to go) please sail on
Maybe (I) maybe (go) oh! (so long) for (twenty) years
I'm sure, I want to go

The young fishrman was helped by a young girl
She helped to confort and to gently take care
He fell in love, and she answered his call
Such happy days, the best time in his life
It was such a short time for the spring in winterland
People rejoyced their rebirth and enjoyed la fate of the sun
Dancing all day, such a grand festivity
He was so moved almost crying... crying

I (don't know) want (to know) how (to go)
I (want to) go to winterland
Let (me know) how (to go) let (me see)
How (to go) please sail on
Maybe (I) maybe (go) oh! (so long) for (twenty) years
I'm sure, I want to go

We've been sleeping, the long winter time
Now he must go home, unable to stay
The people all gone, he was left alone
Everywhere covered, the white blanket snow
Again the fishrman tried to go to winterland
But he could not find his old dreams and his lover
I know him well, scarcely he will talk
And I know the treasures of his mind

I (don't know) want (to know) how (to go)
I (want to) go to winterland
Let (me know) how (to go) let (me see)
How (to go) please sail on
Maybe (I) maybe (go) oh! (so long) for (twenty) years I'm sure
I (don't know) want (to know) how (to go)
I (want to) go to winterland
I don't know it want to know it
How to go to winterland
Maybe I know maybe I go to my long for twenty years
