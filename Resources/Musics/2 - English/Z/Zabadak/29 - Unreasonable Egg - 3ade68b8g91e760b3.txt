UNREASONABLE EGG

One day I woke up to sounds so strange to me
Something it seems was lying on my bed
Oh! Such a strange sight
So smooth to touch so white so much
Such great capacity
It was nothing but an egg

I have two eyeballs in my head (so familiar!)
I have two lungs in my chest (so familiar!)
I have two arms and two legs (so familiar!)

But I've never known such an unreasonable egg
Surely I've never seen such an unreasonable egg

The doctor comes and says try to understand
The pastor comes and says confess your sins to us
The teacher comes and says let's be calm
Someone like think it
Someone likes to know it
But sure all are confused

I have a brain in my head (usuality!)
I have a liver in my belly (usuality!)
I have a mouth in my face (usuality!)

But I've never known such an unreasonable egg
Surely I've never seen such an unreasonable egg

We have the knowledge of all (unreality!)
We have the common sense of all (unreality!)
We have the wisdom, but it is (unreality!)

(Hello dr. Seuss! What it is? It is an egg, what's this both wrong?)

One day I woke up to sounds so strange to me
Something it seems was lying on my bed
So white and so big
Unreasonable egg unreasonable egg unreasonable egg
Unreasonable egg!
Unreasonable egg!
Unreasonable egg!
Unreasonable egg!
Unreasonable egg!
Unreasonable egg!
