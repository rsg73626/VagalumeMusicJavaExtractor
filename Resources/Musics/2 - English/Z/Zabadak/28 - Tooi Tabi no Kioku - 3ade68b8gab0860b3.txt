TOOI TABI NO KIOKU

I heard the voice of the air
I saw the signs of some changes
I cannot stay here any more
I wanna across the border line

Though hesitation prevents me
Tear me away from nostalgia
I cannot stay here any more
Something I longed took ties away

I don't know what I'll be
I don't know where I'll reach
I don't know how long it takes
I believe I find a new world

Something which I can see
Something which I can feel
Someday I'll toil along "there"
From there, the future will be

I'm sure that my journey
I'm sure that the temptation
Made to curve out myself
Therefore I think I must go
