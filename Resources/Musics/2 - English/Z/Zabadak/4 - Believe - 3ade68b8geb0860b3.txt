BELIEVE

Anytime, whenever
You're believin' everybody
Anybody, whenever
Wanna live with true face

Your eyes, your kindness
Forming nature sleeping in loneliness
Your smile, your heart
Shining on all beings even in the depths

You make us notice
Kindness is here and there
You make us realize
Nature we have but forgot

Your will, I know
That is just ideal shape but
Our scars, our darkness
Covering nature going to wake out of
For all that
Your voices
Bringing us light forgetting for a long ago

Your eyes, your kindness
Forming nature sleeping in loneliness
Your smile, and your heart
Shining on all beings even in the depths
Awake your kindness
Surely anybody has the seeds
Awake your true face
They'll become a forest soon

Look at the air
Blowing around
Making us realize, making us notice
Look around through true eyes
You'll see the love singing all little shines
