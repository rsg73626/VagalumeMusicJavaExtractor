DREAMER

May I ask you, what do you wanna be
Any time, any way, I'll be watching you
Dreamer, dreamer, you are the dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer, because you are the dreamer

Life's a journey, sometimes a mystery
In your mind lies the key that opens every door
Dreamer, dreamer, you are the dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer, because you are the dreamer

Build your life on a foundation deep and strong
Show the world that it's where you belong
People seem to be racing the hands of time
Feel no need to be standing in line

A new day with new ways
To change a material world
Just look deep enough and you'll find
What life's all about
Look ahead, serious plans shape the future
With a vision of a better world tomorrow
