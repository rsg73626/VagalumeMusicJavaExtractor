YOU MUST NOT SPEAK ILL OF THE LOVERS

You must not speak ill of the lovers
I found my self lost in me and running back to the others.
Once I caught a reflection on the surface of a shining glass.
Ricochet of emotions in the window looking back at me.
You must not speak ill of the lovers
Soft eyes once turned up to the sun
don't look away if the reflection is neatly undone
Great spirits intervene and hassle my soul
Bonfire burning where once was our home
Soft eyes once turned up to the sun
You must not speak ill of the lovers!
She comes to me and touches the fruit of my soul
Howcome is the wind bringing me this holy creature?
Angel of the wasteland, harmless, and so full of love
You must not speak ill of the lovers!
Soft eyes once turned toward the sun
How could we tear our worlds apart
This curse will haunt me forevermore....
Whatever it takes to break me, come break me now
Whatever it takes to save me, come save me now
