BIG RIVER

On a strange hill
there is a steel mill
cast a shadow
on my hometown

Good men...
Good men don't mess around
they work there still
all the good men in the steel mill

(and everyone knows someone who works at steelmill)

Big river
divides our broken souls!
Big river
is lined with broken homes!

And idle hands...
idle hands need exercise
driving down
the government street

quick turn...
quick turn then accelerate!
and up you go the government street!

(everyone knows someone who drowned into that river)

Big river
divides our broken souls!
Big river
is lined with broken homes!

We are racing down the rapids
down stream we float
Broken souls in the brewery...
in the steel mill
up on the hill

And we are rolling down the government street
to the west beach
to the stone beach
and were getting drunk down by the river!
