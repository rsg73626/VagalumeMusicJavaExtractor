JUDAS

Run through the fire
and run in to the light
and if you see me higher
on a plateau of black and white

this is not my future
I never said that I would love you so
every one is drowning
into the snow

I've seen things in darkness too!
(and I know that Jesus had a name)
In his arms I felt the shame
(for i know that Judas won the game)
All day long I try to find the way
through the pain and crazy days
I've seen things in darkness too!

So where are your loved ones?
and where have the children gone
there is no compassion
if you go and go and run

when you find yourself thinking
how the world can fall tonight
I'm afraid you weren't that wrong
this is our final time

I've seen things in darkness too!
(and I know that Jesus had a name)
In his arms I felt the shame
(for i know that Judas won the game)
All day long I try to find the way
through the pain and crazy days
I've seen things in darkness too!

where is children?
and where is your wife?
everybody wants to hide
I see clouds there
over the skies
the devil & and his daughter
in the light

The dark is rising in the laboratory
project for the greatest of deaths
grand old men are circulating,
evaluating, placing their bets
How about a weapon of choice for us?
wipe out the whole race of men?
We have been given a gift from man!
A weapon to save our heads.
