VULTURES

Kiss my mouth!
you lonely girl
Your heart is like an open book.
Salty waters of teenage lust.
panic attacks,
the taste on your tongue
You can chase the stars
Seek for some retribution
You can chase the stars one more time
and try to find some peace of mind.
chase the stars one more time!
try to find some peace of mind.
Oh Peace of Mind
Take your time and these vultures will be circling around.
And if you walk on by all these people try to pull you underground.
Is there a barcode tattooed to the back of your neck?
Reminding of the times when it was so hard to get connection
Connection with your friends
Then you walk away
Ah, you don't walk away
It's all the same to me'
Yes you can change your mind a thousand times but a change of heart is so hard
You can change your mind a thousand times but a change of heart, the hardest part.
Oh Change of Heart
Take your time and these vultures will be circling around.
And if you walk on by all these people try to pull you underground.
You keep building on your very own illusion of a perfect life
You got to work on some kind of solution to ease your worried mind.
people think
and they assume
people debate
bang their fist on the table
and bang that fist on your face.
raise a fist in the air.
like I care?
no one really knows
no one really knows'Â¦You are just a wannabe
and I don't wanna wannabe like you!
