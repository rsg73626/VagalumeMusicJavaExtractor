IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM LIFE?

From a distance a wawe comes crushing
through my body it flies
A fire-demon with a smile everstretching
A preacher with a mission to preach
Running away with a will to be normal
It's how the movement meets the eye
Deeds are hard to measure from pleasant to pleasure
Love of life will grind you down

Priest of chalkland with a rope in his right hand
Dragging around a bible in the ground
The one I love with pain and desire!
The one I love will burn in fire!

Even if my feelings are very clear and bright
stars they shine brighter, moon is my guiding light
How come the whole world ain't heartbroken because I feel so bad tonight
I got devil on my shoulder and the angel by my side
Is this what you want from life?
Is this what you had in mind?
Is this what you want from life on another way round

Like a fragment from a western movie
I see her closing in
From the dusk I see her white body
Walking next to mine

Parasites of paradise are crawling on the yard of The Castle of Light.
Look here is a western freeway,where cars just sleep and die!

Like the Priest of Chalkland with a rope in his right hand
dragging around a bible in the ground
The one I love with pain and desire!
The one I love will burn in fire!

Even if my feelings are very clear and bright
stars they shine brighter,Moon is my guiding light
How come the whole world ain't heartbroken because I feel so bad tonight
I got devil on my shoulder and the angel by my side
This is not what I want from life
This is not what I had in mind
This is not what I want from life on another way round

Troubled wine and a state of bliss
So many times I've had moments like this
This is not what I want from life.
Every time I turn my head it's my time to die
