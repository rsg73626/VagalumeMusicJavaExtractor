CRIMSON HORSE

Out of the sun there came a pale rider
following a trace of thiefs and the liars
Dragged himself in and locked the gates
to the harbour of love

Somewhere behind
the sun there is a mystery
the undying force
The wawe of our history
let it wash on my face,
wipe every little trace that I regret.

A promise that is kept is a gift from a junkie.
for love that is real and hurting me truly can save my mind and my soul is in bliss anyhow.

How could I choose a way to affection.
the caring of you, all that wait in the chains,
how life can lead you to better things
by denying your very soul

Somewhere behind the sun there is a mystery
the undying force
The wawe of our history
let it wash on my face,
wipe every little trace that I regret.
There is no compassion
for anyone who enters
there are rules to be followed
as the fight on our playground
will never ever go down.
Evil is alive in the pages of the bibleWhy not let the wind?
keep on whistling the tune
of praise and forgiveness,
where king is dethroned
and his horse is drowning to the sea,
Come Save us now!

All hail the Crazy king!
He brought us redemption
and gave us our love
He gave us faith
that will conquer all waves,
wash over black days
Come Save us now!
