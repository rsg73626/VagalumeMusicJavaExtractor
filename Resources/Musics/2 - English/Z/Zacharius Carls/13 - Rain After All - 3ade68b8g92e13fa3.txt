RAIN AFTER ALL

I open the door
I say hello
Never spoken a word before

They greet me by smiling
some even laugh
you can sense the hatred
in their voices

I see 3 angels
sitting before me
someone took my wings last night
so now I cry

and right there between them
I see her face on the wall
I see her lips moving
"come out of the dark"

Take me to this place outside...
and when my time comes...
let me die in your arms

And when I really start to enjoy
they are not my children
no not anymore

Rain after all
after all this
for the first time i really feel...
rejected
