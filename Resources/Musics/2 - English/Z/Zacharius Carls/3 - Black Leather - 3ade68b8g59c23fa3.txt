BLACK LEATHER

Outside
They are waiting
wasting Black Leather
on their shoes of fear
Inside
Their world of insanity
someday we all will disappear
Somehow
the world is turning
greeting your smile on your face
New shoes, new hair, new everything I'll see
someday will set me free
Oh There is a town
There is a town filled with beautiful people
How do you feel?
Cigar of freedom awaits you on the table
First breath kicks you down
Outside they are waiting
wasting their time on people like me
