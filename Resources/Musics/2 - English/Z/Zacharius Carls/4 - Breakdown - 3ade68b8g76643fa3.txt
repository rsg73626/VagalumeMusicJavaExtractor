BREAKDOWN

I see you walking there on these clouds and I see you breakdown
Driving in your fancy car. I see you breakdown
Hold me now cos' I don't want to breakdown like ice.
In a restaurant, a prettiest girl
she is just about to breakdown
See em' with a stylish man
We all shall breakdown
Don't fall down
It's allways the same, it's allways around
Hold me now
I don't wanna see your crown
Give me comfort and leave me here
I need to concentrate!
And in the distance the morning brakes
She is ready to hop that train.
Don't fall down
It's allways the same, it's allways around
Hold me now...
I hope you never say Goodbye
I hope you find some sense this time
Keep on shining your tender white light
Straight out from the deepest insides of your innocence,
how everybody needs to love someone
Innocence needs to love somebody,
Innocence wants to love someone
So hold on, hold on, hold on
Try to rise above,
try to reach out for love
but it will find, it will follow.
