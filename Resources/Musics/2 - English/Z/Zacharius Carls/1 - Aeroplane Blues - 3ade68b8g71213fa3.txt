AEROPLANE BLUES

And after a while i look to the skies
And crumbling down comes my aeroplane blues
Somebodys shoes are on your shore tonight baby
Have we found anyone alive have we found anyone tonight?

Mother earth
Father sky
Sister water
Brother fire
They all will fall apart someday

Ocean of wisdom is here for you and me baby
Ocean of wisdom so deep,dark and blue
Should we take a dive and see what we are inside?
Should we take a dive, should we swim til' the day we die?

Mother earth
Father sky
Sister water
Brother fire
They all will fall apart someday

Heaven above should be everyones haven
But tickets are sold out, in goverment we trust!
Damn all you narrow minded people
Trying to sell me your solutions

Mother earth
Father sky
Sister water
Brother fire
They all will fall apart someday
