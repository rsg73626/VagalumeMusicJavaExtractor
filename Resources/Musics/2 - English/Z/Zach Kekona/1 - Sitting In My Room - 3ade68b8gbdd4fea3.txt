SITTING IN MY ROOM

(yeah you know, now love is a special thing, treat your woman right and you stand out in her mind)

Love is the thing someone in this world can bring, world can bring 
But when it goes away it will be your darkest day, your darkest day
She was the love of my life and I gave her my heart, gave her my heart
But she left one day as she tore it all apart oh woah woah

That's why I'm sitting in my room wondering where my babies gone, I'm feeling blue 
I'm sitting in my room wondering if she'll come back to my life one day

I should love you baby and you know I do, you know I do
The feelings that I have are only meant for you, this is how I feel:
Roses are red violets are blue honey is sweet but not as sweet as you
Roses are red violets are blue cant you see that my love is true 

I'm sitting in my room wondering where my babies gone, I'm feeling blue 
I'm sitting in my room wondering if she'll come back to my life one day 

Love is the thing someone in this world can bring, world can bring 
But when it goes away it will be your darkest day, your darkest day
She was the love of my life and I gave her my heart, gave her my heart
But she left one day as she tore it all apart oh woah woah

(Reggae Chorus)

I'm sitting in my room wondring where my babies, gone im feeling blue
I'm sitting in my room wondering if she'll come back to my life one day

(Yeah you know, see, now love is a spesial thing, treat your woman right and you'll stand out in her mind
Sitting here all alone please come back here)
