FILÉ GUMBO

Breaux Bridge Betty called me up on the party line, 
Said, “Baby I just gotta know, 
If you got some-a-dat “Make me feel so fine”, 
I’m talking about that Filé Gumbo. 

“Betty,” I said, “I got what you gotta have, 
I made some just a little while ago. 
It’s got a black pot roux and some ground up sassafras, 
I’m talking about that Filé Gumbo.” 

Bring that boy some -a-dat Filé Gumbo, 
Bring that boy a bowl. 
Bring that boy some-a-dat Filé Gumbo, 
Hurry up before it gets cold. 

I quiver and I shiver from the feeling it delivers, 
And I keep coming back for just a little more. 
It’s got the right spice to make me feel so nice, 
My Louisiana Filé Gumbo. 

So if you down in the dumps and you’re stuck in a slump, 
And you’re looking up the wrong end of the blues. 
Have yourself some-a-dat Filé Gumbo, 
More better than that chcken bar-b-q. 

Bridge: 
Gumbo filé makes me feel so good. 
Although I eat it more ofter than I really should, 
But if I could I surely would have some more gumbo
