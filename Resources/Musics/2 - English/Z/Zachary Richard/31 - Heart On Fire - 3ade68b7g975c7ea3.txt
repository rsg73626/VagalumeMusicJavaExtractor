HEART ON FIRE

Standing on the corner playing for nickels and dimes, 
When I saw you for the very first time. 
You said, “Come away with me gypsy boy” 
Right then I could feel the spark, 
Burning, burning, lighting up the dark, 
And it set my heart, heart on fire. 

The years have fallen like the magnolia leaves, 
The summer storm has become this gentle breeze. 
But like when love was young 
And the flamme was easy to start, 
Burning, burning, lighting up the dark, 
And it set my heart, heart on fire. 

Chorus 
Heart on fire, 
I can’t stop the burning. 
I’m running wild like a mischevious child 
With my heart on fire. 

Hold on to your dreams for if they die, 
The fire burning will grow cold inside.
