MY NANETTE

Hey my Nanette, 
What did you get 
All night long? 

Tell me the truth, 
What did you do 
All night long? 

I’m gonna tell your mama, My Nanette. 

Hey, Mary Lou, 
Tell me the news 
About Nanette. 

In back of the school, 
In black Cadillac 
All night long. 

I’m gonna tell your mama, My Nanette. 

Hey my Nanette, 
What did you do 
All night long?
