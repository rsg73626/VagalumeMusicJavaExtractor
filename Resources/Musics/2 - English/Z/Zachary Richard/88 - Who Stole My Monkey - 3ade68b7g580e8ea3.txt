WHO STOLE MY MONKEY

I woke up this morning, 
And I looked all around. 
I was looking for my monkey, 
My monkey couldnâ€™t be found. 

I called the police department, 
Put out an APB. 
So if you find my monkey, 
Send her on home to me. 

Who stole my monkey, my monkey, my monkey? 
Somebody stole my monkey, stole my monkey from me. 
Who stole my monkey, my monkey, my monkey? 
Somebody stole that funky ole monkey from me. 

So I moved to California, 
Way down in Hollywood. 
I got a brand new monkey 
And we was doing real good. 
Standing on the corner, 
Singing a monkey grinding song. 
When the next thing I new, 
Somebody played me for a fool. 
She took my money and was long gone. 

Bridge: 

My monkey got a cue ball head, 
She got a good attitude 
And them long skinny legs. 
When we get back to the motel room, 
The way she shakes her tail 
It makes my heart go boom, boom
