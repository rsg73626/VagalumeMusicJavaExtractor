ROCK IT OUT

Put up your dust rag and your broom, 
We gonna rock it out tonight. 
We gonna chase away the gloom, 
We gonna rock it out tonight. 
Roll up the rug and put your dancing shoes on, 
We gonna boogie woogi ‘til the break of dawn. 
I wanna go, I wanna go, 
Rock it out tonight. 

Put up the tables and the chairds, 
We gonna rock it out tonight. 
We gonna chase away our cares, 
We gonna rock it out tonight. 
Tell everybody in the neighborhood, 
We gonna get so high, it’s gonna fell so good. 
I wanna go, I wanna go, 
Rock it out tonight. 

Call all the girls around the block, 
We gonna rock it out tonight. 
With no intention to ever stop. 
We gonna rock it out tonight. 
We gonna have ourselves a who-da-dang, 
We might never come back home again. 
I wanna go, I wanna go, 
And when I say I wanna go 
Well lordy, lordy, don’t you know, 
I wanna go, I wanna go, 
Rock it out tonight
