CING THE FLOOR

The pills that I took tonight 
Won’t let me sleep. 
I’m pacing the floor 
With sweet dreams of you. 
I spend most of my time 
Hanging on a bar, 
Running ‘gainst my hard blues 
And losing the race. 
When I get to the finish 
I’m right back at the start, 
Trying to chase another 
Sad memory away. 

I went to the city, 
Felt like playing the star, 
Feeding the fires 
Of the honkey-tonk queens. 
But dealing in the flesh scene 
Won’t get you very far, 
A man needs a woman 
If you know what I mean. 

Chorus : Lonesome moon in a crystal black sky, 
The bottle’s been dry for a while. 
I done walked through the soles 
Of my new cowboy boots, 
Pacing the floor with 
Sweet dreams of you. 

A guitar picker 
Leads a serious life, 
Trying to find the love light 
To put in his song. 
Trying to find the one lick 
That’s gonna make it alright. 
Struggling with the right words 
That all come out wrong
