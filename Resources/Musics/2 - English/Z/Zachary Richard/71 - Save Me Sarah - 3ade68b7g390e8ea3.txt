SAVE ME SARAH

How many nights, 
I’ve wanted to hold you? 
How many times 
Have I waited for your call? 

So many days, 
Alone and lonely, 
So many seasons change 
Since you’ve been gone. 

Chorus 
Save me, 
Sarah, 
My wings are broken from the searching for your love, 
I need you tonight. 
Save me, 
Sarah, 
My eyes are blinded from the watching for your love, 
I need you tonight. 

Baby please, 
It’s a long long journey. 
I’ll never make it home 
On my own. 

Save me, 
Sarah, 
My wings are broken from the searching for your love, 
I need you tonight. 
Save me, 
Sarah, 
My heart is bleeding from the needin of your love, 
I need you tonight.
