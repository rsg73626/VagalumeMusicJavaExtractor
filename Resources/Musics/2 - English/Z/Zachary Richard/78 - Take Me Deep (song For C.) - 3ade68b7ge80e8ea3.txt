TAKE ME DEEP (SONG FOR C.)

Tonight your voice came closer in, 
Through brand new ears, I hear the sound. 
Once again I fell the tenderness within 
As I lay in you, my life reflected in your flow. 

Tonight your troubled arms held high, 
You pressed me deeper than you know. 
I have never felt anything so right, 
Just listening to your heart beating next to mine. 

Take me deep in your loving arms and hold me tight. 
Hold me through the long and the lonely night. 
And if it ever seems to you that Iâ€™m just drifting on away, 
I never never want to leave your side
