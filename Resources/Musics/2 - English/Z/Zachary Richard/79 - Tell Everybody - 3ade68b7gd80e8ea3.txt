TELL EVERYBODY

Tell everybody, 
Baby, this fool’s in love with you. 
My hands started shaking, 
My heart started aching. 
Tell everybody, 
You are my one and only lover, 
You are my sweet sensation, my soul inspiration. 

Chorus: 
I call you up on the telephone, 
It’s me, baby, and I am all alone. 
It’s not something that I usually do, 
But I am upside down for a girl like you. 

Since I met you, 
I have been walking on a cloud, 
I’m telling you baby, 
I’m saying it real loud
