SHADES OF BLUE

Shades of blue on a white snow ground, 
Silver stars in the night surrounding you, 
Love is true for all life, 
Shades of blue, shades of loving you. 

Tonight I just want to be close to you 
All night, all night 
Tonight just let me make love to you 
All night, all night long. 


Story told in turquoise and gold, 
Voices in the wind, calling out to you 
To be true to your story unfolding, 
Shades of blue, shades of loving you.
