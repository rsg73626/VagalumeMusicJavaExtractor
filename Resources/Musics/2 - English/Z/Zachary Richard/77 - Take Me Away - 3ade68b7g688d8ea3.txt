TAKE ME AWAY

I’ve been looking for you all of my life, 
But I never ever knew it ‘til I saw you last night. 
I can barely tell you how it made me feel. 
When the world stopped moving and my heart stood still. 

Take me away. 

Come on, pretty baby, take me for a ride. 
You don’t have to say it I can see it in your eyes. 
Standing on the corner of Hiway 93, 
Here comes the king of Zydeco in a black limousine. 

Come on, pretty baby, come on take me away. 
Make love with me baby each and every day. 

Bridge: 
This place means nothing to me, 
Waiting for the end to come. 
But when I saw you there, 
I knew, I knew that you had to be the one 
To make my life worth living, 
Come on and take me away.
