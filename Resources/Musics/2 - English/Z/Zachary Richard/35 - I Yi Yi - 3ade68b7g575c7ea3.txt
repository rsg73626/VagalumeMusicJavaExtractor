I YI YI

Way down in Louisiana 
Underneath the evergreens, 
I was sitting there and thinking 
When along came a Cajun queen. 
I said, "I’m going to a party, 
Baby, do you want to go?" 
She said, "I yi yi, I yi yi, 
I yi yi don’t know". 

I yi yi, I yi yi, I yi yi, no no. 
I yi yi, I yi yi, I yi yi, no no. 

Way down on the bayou, 
With my friend Thibodeaux, 
We was drinking wine and feeling fine, 
When he jumped in his pirogue. 
He said, "I’m going to the city, 
Baby, do you want to go, 
I said, "I yi yi, I yi yi, 
I just don’t think so"
