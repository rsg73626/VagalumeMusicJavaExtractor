DOWN IN CONGO SQUARE

In the deep of the night, with the beat of the drum, 
Watch out, baby, now here she comes. 
Dancing Colinda just like I said, 
Silver on her ankles and silk on her head. 

I want to meet you tonight, down there, 
We gonna shake it down in Congo Square. 

Just how it got started don’t nobody know, 
It was maybe Dr. Ya-Ya, maybe John Creaux. 
Play the Bamboula with the open hand, 
Swinging to the rhythm from the mother land. 

I want to meet you tonight, down there, 
We gonna shake it down in Congo Square. 

Anything you want it, you can find it there, 
Mojo for money, gris-gris for love, 
Down in Congo Square. 

In the middle of the summer ont he eve of Saint John, 
Full moon is shining, they’ll be carrying on. 
Come from down the river and miles around, 
To see them jump up on the dancing ground. 

I want to meet you tonight, down there, 
We gonna shake it down in Congo Square
