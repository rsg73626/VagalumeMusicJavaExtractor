DANCING AT DOUBLE D’S

Way back up in the country on the Bayou road, 
There’s a little place where all the Creoles go. 
Where they play that old time Zydeco. 
You ain’t never seen nothing like that before. 

I’m talking about the one and only Double D. 
C’est un vaillant bougre et créole aussi. 
He’s always got some boudin and some hot filé, 
Du bon whiskey et du bon café. 

Ch: 
Dancing at DDs. They really know how to please. 
Dancing at DDs. Down at the Double Ds. 

You ain’t never gonna have yourself a better time, 
Take it from the Double D and he ain’t lying. 
It’s just about enough to break this heart of mine 
To see them creole ladies when the full moon shines.
