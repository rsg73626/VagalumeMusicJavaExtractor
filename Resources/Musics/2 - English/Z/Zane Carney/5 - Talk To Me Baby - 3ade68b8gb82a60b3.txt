TALK TO ME BABY

There's music in your voice
A song so soft and sweet
That I had no choice
My love
I'm praying for a whisper in my ear
Just a sound to make it clear
So, I'm sitting here waiting by the phone

Talk to me baby
I don't wanna be wrong
Talk to me baby
What's the use in takin' so long
I will be waiting
For you to come on home
So, talk to me baby
Tell me that I'm not alone

My heart is open wide
And in the safety of my arms you can hide
My love
I lay down my desire just for you
And I know you love me too
So, I'm sitting here waiting by the phone

Talk to me baby
I don't wanna be wrong
Talk to me baby
What's the use in takin' so long
I will be waiting
For you to come on home
So, talk to me baby
Tell me that I'm not alone

Only you
Can prove
Me wrong

Talk to me baby
I wanna hear the music in you
Talk to me baby
Tell me that you're feeling it too
I will be waiting
For you to come on back
Just come to me

Talk to me baby
OOh
Talk to me baby
