DOCTOR DOCTOR

Brace yourself
I'm reaching over to the second shelf
This vaccination isn't for my health
It's just another way to see myself

Alleviate
The pain inside me is an open grave
It's not the mustard seed that gives me faith
But, watch me chew it 'til I seem ok
Hey, hey

Doctor, doctor
Can you see
My need
Doctor, doctor
I believe
I'm sinking
Where we you when my disease
Took me
Doctor, doctor
I'm begging please
I'm on my knees
Can it be?

All of me
You just won't stop 'til you have all of me
And there is nothing that I cannot be
When you are breathing deep inside of me


So, take me hand
Lead me to places I don't understand
There's nothing left to solve or grasp at hand
So teach me how to love surrender again
When I say

Doctor, doctor
Can you see
My need
Doctor, doctor
I believe
I'm sinking
Where we you when my disease
Took me
Doctor, doctor
I'm begging please
I'm on my knees
Can it be?

Here I am
I'm at the alter of the great I am
My eyes themselves cannot encapsulate
Nor height or depth who try to separate

You from me
Nor from this moment that was meant to be
I see acceptance as the sacred truth
That keeps my past and future out of view
Where you hold me

Doctor, doctor
Can you see
My need
Doctor, doctor
I believe
I'm sinking
Where we you when my disease
Took me
Doctor, doctor
I'm begging please
I'm on my knees
Can it be?
Uncover my needs
And be set free
