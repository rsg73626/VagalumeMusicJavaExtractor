DREAM

What does it mean
When you don't ever dream
When you don't ever dream of me?

What do you see
When you're looking at me?
Am I not who you want me to be?

Hold your head up high babe, you're enough
Equal signs are hanging up above
Are these rafters all there ever was?
I guess we only dreamt of something more above us

What does it mean
When you won't ever sleep
When you won't ever sleep with me?

Forgotten ain't freed
But it's too hard to be seen
So, I'm hiding in all of my dreams

Break my bones so I can settle down
Let me lie beneath the fertile ground
Maybe I'm not ready to be found
Or maybe this is just the way it's s'posed to be

Alone
Alone

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe you're right
Maybe it's time to flip it over

But this page it won't turn
Well, let's see if it burns
I'm lighting the torch
Let's get it over with

Ooh
Watch it burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Ooh
Watch it burn
Watch it burn, burn

Remember when we
Thought we needed the beat
Or we'd always be incomplete?

The rhythm between
Is the wonder I need
Now I'm moving with both my feet

I keep taking bigger leaps of faith
Legs get stronger every single day
Hands let go of every resum√©
But, floating in the wind is such an empty feeling

What does it mean
When you don't ever dream
When you don't ever dream of me?
