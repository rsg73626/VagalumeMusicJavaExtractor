DRIVING IN CIRCLES

Memories, they always leave me
Just like you
Left my bed
But those clothes you left behind
They don't believe me
And they can't change
The things you said

So I'm driving in circles
Wishing you would take the wheel and set me free
Cause it's just so painful
To eccept that now is where I'm supose to be

I hoped
That I could leave you
And I tried
So many times
But every time I look into a mirror
I'm staring into your eyes


So I'm driving in circles
Wishing you would take the wheel and set me free
Cause it's just so painful
To accept that now is where I'm suposed to be

OOh
OOh

To accept your love
To receive it
You exceed
Abundantly above
All I've ever asked for
And all I'll ever need
As I turn

So, I'm driving in circles
Wishing you would take the wheel and set me free
Cause it's just so painful
To accept that now is where I'm suposed to be

OOh
OOh

So I'm driving in circles
Wishing you would take the wheel and set me free
Cause it's just do painful
To believe that this is it
To admit that I am here
To accept that I'm who I meant
To be
