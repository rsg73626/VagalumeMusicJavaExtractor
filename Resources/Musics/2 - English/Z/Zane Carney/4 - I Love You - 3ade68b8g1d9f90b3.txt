I LOVE YOU

Open up your eyes and then you'll see
You're the only one who's standing next to me
Does it have to be a mystery
While we contemplate if this is destiny?

Oh where do you go
When you lose control?

I love you
I love you
It's so hard
Being alone
I won't lie
I'm on my own
Oh

I can magnify a hollow touch
But I can't believe that I'm not strong enough
Maybe it's the way I comb my hair
Lulls me to deceive myself I'm all that's here

Oh where do you go
When you lose control?

I love you
I love you
It's so hard
Being alone
I won't lie
I'm on my own
OOh

Don't leave yourself momma
OOh
Don't leave yourself momma
OOh
Don't leave yourself momma
OOh
Don't leave yourself momma
OOh

Oh where do you go
When you lose control?

I love you
I love you
It's so hard
Being alone
I won't lie
I'm on my own
Left behind
Stuck to you
Left behind
Stuck to you
OOh

Cause I love you
I love you
I love you
