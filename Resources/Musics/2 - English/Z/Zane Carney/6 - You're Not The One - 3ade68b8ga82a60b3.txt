YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

Baby girl
You're just my kind of drug
The reason that I'm always on the run
But, together we become the mourning dove
Flying over all the damage that we've done

Cause You're not the One
I've got all the proof in my tears
You're not the One
You've already broken my heart
My dear
It's time
I'm letting go of you

But, every time I look into your eyes
Heart skips a beat
And eyes are hypnotized
I can't give you what I don't even know I need
Moreover is the venom that I bleed

Cause You're not the One
I've got all the proof in my tears
You're not the One
You've already broken my heart
My dear
It's time
I'm letting go of you

Yeah
Go on and save yourself

Cause You're not the One
I've got all the proof in my tears
You're not the One
You've already broken my heart
My dear
It's time
I'm letting go of you

Baby girl
You're just my kind of drug
The reason that I'm always
On the run
