WHY

I can't stop
Thinkin' 'bout you
I'm missing you and me
We used to be
I remember what you said
Trying to get that out of my head
And I never thought that
I would make it through

And I've been trying, trying, baby
I've been trying to understand
Where did this get so out of hand?
I've been trying, trying, baby
I wish I knew the truth
Maybe it was me or maybe it was you

Where did you go? I need to know
Tonight, tonight
Just tell me why, I gotta make things right
Tonight, tonight

I'm tryna be strong
What's taking so long
I gotta know how to right these wrongs
And if it's all the same
I can take the blame
So we can start playing this game

And I've been trying, trying, baby
I've been trying to understand
Where did this get so out of hand?
I've been trying, trying, baby
I wish I knew the truth
Maybe it was me or maybe it was you

Where did you go? I need to know
Tonight, tonight
Just tell me why, I gotta make things right
Tonight, tonight

I take back what I said, I take back what I did
I've never meant to hurt you and I'm sorry what I did
I take back what I said, I take back what I did
I'd never meant to hurt you, can we start again?
I take back what I said, I take back what I did
I've never meant to hurt you, and I'm sorry what I did
I take back what I said, I take back what I did
I'd never meant to hurt you, can we start again?

Where did you go? I need to know
Tonight, tonight
Just tell me why, I gotta make things right
Tonight, tonight
