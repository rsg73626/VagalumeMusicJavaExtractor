NAMELESS

Rescue them and rescue me
From the pain and jealousy
Make them want and make them need
Everything that seems to bleed

Save me from this hellish hole
This hole, this place they call my soul
If this is how you want to end
My life will never mend

Listen to me and thank your God
That he won't leave with just a nod
It's hard... It's hard

Save me from this hellish hole
This hole this place they call my soul
And if you want me to end
My life will never mend

Everything just seems to bleed
My heart my soul when I'm in need
So come and get me if you can
But if you don't I'll understand
