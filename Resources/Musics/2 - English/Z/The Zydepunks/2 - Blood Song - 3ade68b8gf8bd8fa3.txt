BLOOD SONG

You were there then you were gone
Along the levees I ran up and down
I ran and ran until I saw
The fire in you eyes

Not one bullet, but three
Took away your life from me
Were we the ones
For whom you died in vain

I will spill their wicked blood, and
Drag their foul hearts through the mud
Vengeance brother in your name
Vengeance not in vain

He faded before my eyes, so I
Cursed and swore & roared and cried
So damn me God till Judgement Day
Where you will face my wrath

Blood will pay with blood, limb with limb
Oh will the rains ever come
To wash away the burdens
That hang from us like stones?

The tears aren't enough to calm
The spirits of the dead that roam
Will you who haunt our fair town
Find your peace at last

Let your guns sing their songs
Let your bullets right old wrongs
Ils laissent les armes a feux chanter
Tuant la vie sans rien trouver

Hear hear the blood song
Through battles that are lost and won
Through the smoke and fire
Can you see the bullets run?

Dark and evil is the day
When they find you dead like stone
Could you see their deadly kiss
Through the fire in your eyes?

Let your guns sing their songs
Let your bullets right old wrongs
Ils laissent les armes a feux chanter
Tuant la vie sans rien trouver
