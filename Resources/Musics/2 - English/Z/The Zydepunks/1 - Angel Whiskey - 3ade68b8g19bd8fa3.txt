ANGEL WHISKEY

I met her when I got to town
Killing time she'd never found
Dead men telling dead men's tales
Through dirty shades of gray

A who is you and where you at
A thousand words, a smile and dance
Ten shots of Jack for all my friends
Trembling at the hands

Angel Whiskey was her name
It's funny, it was all the same
Romancing in the Vieux Carré
Night turned into day

Eyes like starlight been and gone
A wicked laugh, forbidden song
My innocent caught up by sin
My Lucifer's true love

Angel Whiskey, my disgrace
I couldn't stare into your face
Your eyes stared cold and grey and true
Into an empty soul

Angel Whiskey, my disgrace
I couldn't stare into your face
Your eyes stared cold and grey and true
Into an empty soul

I curse the day I came to town
This dead man's dream, this widow's gown
This spirit from the devil's realm
Jealous to the end

The old folks in their drunken homes
The women roam like battered ghost
Hearts of men are turned to stone
Their children are the damned

In another city God forgot
I left my liver to the rot
Angel Whiskey, please don't leave me
To this fate of mine

Nighttime turning into day
No altar there for me to pray
Forgive me for a thousand nights
That I will never know

Life in dreary paradise
I lost my past but with a price
A wicked roll of the dice
Was all that it took

Gambling on another tab
Till break of dawn to pay them back
Testing fate in my Angel's lap
My sorry quest for love

Some say he took her from my side
Some say she left to kill my pride
With Whiskey as my only guide
You might guess that I was lost

When I stumbled in that wicked dawn
And I saw that she was gone
My heart sank like a tombstone
Into a lake of fire

Angel Whiskey, my disgrace
I couldn't stare into your face
Your eyes stared cold and grey and true
Into my empty soul

Nighttime turning into day
No altar there for me to pray
Forgive me for a thousand nights
That I will never know
