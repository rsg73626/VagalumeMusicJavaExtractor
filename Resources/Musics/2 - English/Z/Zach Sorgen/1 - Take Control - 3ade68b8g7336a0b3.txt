TAKE CONTROL

Take control

I take your breath away
I 'll make you wanna stay
Take control
The game I like to play
The same as everyday
Take control
With you, you only give me love
Please anything at all
No, you
You would give at all
So if was my kingdom fall
Only with you I can lose it
Only with you I let go
Only with you I can do it
Only if you, take control

Take control

You know that nobody is saying no to me
Take control
So don't you take the lead
Girl won't you follow me?
Take control

You
You wouldn't let me win
And now I'm own my knees
No, you
You make me some air, to this power over me

Only with you I can lose it
Only with you I let go
Only with you I can do it
Only if you, take control

Take control

You
You wouldn't let me win
And now I'm own my knees
No, you
You make me some air, to this power over me

Only with you I can lose it
Only with you I let go
Only with you I can do it
Only if you, take control

Only with you I can lose it
Only with you I let go
Only with you I can do it
Only if you, take control
Take control
