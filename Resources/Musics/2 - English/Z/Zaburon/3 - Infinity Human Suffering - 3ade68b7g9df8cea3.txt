INFINITY HUMAN SUFFERING

All the world is conscious 
of the endless suffering 
impending on all humanity. 
It’s vile end perseverant, 
it’s objective is to wear the mind 
and the human soul, 
to destroy the man 
with a mortal delirium. 
So maniac thoughts 
and suicidal tendences, 
will populate your head, 
suffocating your life. 
A slow and suffering decline 
will take you to madness. 
Infinite human suffering. 
You, poor mortal 
will only follow 
the torturing way, 
that will bring you 
to a brutal suicide. 
You will study your decay, 
you will program it, 
waiting in solitude 
and than cancel your traces. 
The fatal moment is approaching, 
you are victim of depression, 
death will be the only way of salvation. 
The last song, the last sighs, 
one smudge word on the wall. 
The freezing body of a boy lie hanged, 
he has lost dreams and all hopes.
