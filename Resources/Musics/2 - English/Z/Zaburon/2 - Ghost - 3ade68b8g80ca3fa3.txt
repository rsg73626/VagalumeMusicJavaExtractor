GHOST

Out Of The Night, They Came With Bad Intention
They Had One Thing In Mind, Rape A Peaceful Nation

Their Motives Were Clear, There's Death Everywhere
An Insatiable Greed, Genocide, Extermination

Like Hounds Outta Hell, Under Satan's Dark Spell
They Raped And They Slaughtered Every Mother And
Daughter

Screams Rent The Air, There's Death Everywhere
A Voracious Machine It Will Lick Your Bones Clean

A Race Is Gone Like Snow In A Summer Sun
Just Names From The Past, No More Shadows Will They
Cast

Screams Rent The Air, There's Death Everywhere
A Voracious Machine It Will Lick Your Bones Clean

Their Motives Were Clear, There's Death Everywhere
An Insatiable Greed, Genocide, Extermination

Ghost Dancer, Hear The Spirits Cry
Ghost Dancer, Whispers On The Wind
Ghost Dancer, There's No Reason Why
Ghost Dancer, Protect Us With Thy Name
