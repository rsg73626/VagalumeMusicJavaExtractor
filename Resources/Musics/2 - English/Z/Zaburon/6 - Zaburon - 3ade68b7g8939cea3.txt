ZABURON

Evil sounds burst in me, 
I’m turning into a morbid beast 
crushing and smashing I escape from my cage room, 
I jump into the darkness, 
where unreal creatures 
all around 
offer me their throne. 
My ego it’s dying 
victim of his majesty, 
macabre illusion on my mind. 
Syndrome of hate and hypocrisy. 
The embrace has began, 
my obscure spirit 
born in the horror cradle. 
The anger and all my fears 
blast my mind 
creating my foolish mask. 
My body has crossed the limit, 
the point of no return. 
The mirror reflect my face. 
I look at my eyes 
But they are too deep. 
My power increase. 
My strength blast. 
Unbreakable armour. 
An evil voice inside me, 
Increasing and control me. 
I’m not me. 
Roar of a violent impact. 
Evil incarnation evil. 
Now I’m the invincible creature 
I always desire. 
I’m falling, 
nothing it’s able to stop me. 
It’s amazing, 
I am the only chief of myself 
It’s a possession, 
I am his slave. 
Great Imagination, 
It can change you in something 
obscure and dreadful, 
but you have to know 
It’s just a dream, 
and life call you back to reality. 
Try to escape 
from the mirrors circle 
that’s reflecting you.
