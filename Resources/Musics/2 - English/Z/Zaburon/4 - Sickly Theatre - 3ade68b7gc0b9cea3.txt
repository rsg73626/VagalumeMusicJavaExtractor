SICKLY THEATRE

The train of death 
continue his mad run, 
unknown is the destination. 
Many questions, many doubts, 
immense terror. 
Terrible visions appear, 
the painful child cry 
Unable to understand and to will. 
People dejected 
over their excrement, 
gagged like dirty animal. 
They are guilty to be alive, 
our lives destroyed 
by the humour of tyrants. 
A long barbed wire, 
dogs and guardians, 
a sickly theatre. 
The sight was obscene, 
thousand of people dying 
without a name. 
Bar code men 
enslaved like beasts 
left into the mud, 
dressed by gray uniforms 
masks of blood 
without an expression, 
trembling corpses. 
Their eyes reflect 
a painful trip. 
A big tower dominate the scene 
spreading ashes and dust, 
doom on the fields. 
A long barbed wire, 
dogs and guardians, 
a sickly theatre. 
We can’t see… 
They have to go 
to the tower 
to meet their carnage.
