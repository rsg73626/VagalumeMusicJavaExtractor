DOTTED LINES

Quiet whispers show the way
But the screams always complain
And I don't know which voice is mine
Or which of the voices tell me lies
No way to run from what's inside
Maybe this body should be sacrificed
To free my soul from the demons
To bring silence to the screaming

Nowhere to Run
Nowhere to Hide
Contemplating My Suicide (x2)

I see things that don't exist
Dotted lines drawn on my wrist
Fact or fiction I can't tell
But what is heaven if this is hell
Why won't the voices quit
That is my only wish
In the end I'll pay the price
To kill the demons I must die

Nowhere to Run
Nowhere to Hide
Contemplating My Suicide (x4)

Bridge

Nowhere to Run
Nowhere to Hide
Contemplating My Suicide (x4)
