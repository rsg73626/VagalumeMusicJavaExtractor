FALLING

Kill this void these scars let me know that I'm ignored
And I'm afraid of my escape, could you never wipe my tears away?

I'm falling deeper into midnight
Where God's face slowly fades away
Into a dream, into a scream
Brought on by all this pain

And I'm falling faster, I always fall apart when I
See disappointment in your eyes
Yeah, I know you love me, but I know you judge me
Apologies for everything - I never could seem to breathe right
I'm sorry that I can't live your life

I'm falling deeper into midnight
Where God's face slowly fades away
Into a dream, into a scream
Brought on by all this pain

This void stares at me
A shapeless dream
Stars search for a home
In this dark sky
And I wipe my tears away

I'm falling deeper into midnight
Where God's face slowly fades away
Into a dream, into a scream
Brought on by all this pain
