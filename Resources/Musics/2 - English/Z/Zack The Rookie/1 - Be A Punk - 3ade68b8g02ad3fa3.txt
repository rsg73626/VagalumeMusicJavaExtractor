BE A PUNK

I get so tired of always keeping my sanity
Being a puppet just for everyone's vanity
There was a time when i was just me
Before i got lost inside the punk rock scene

Now i'd do about anything
Just so i could be a punk
Got a mohawk dyed it green
Just so i could be a punk
Denounced nirvana and the pumpkins
Just so i could be a punk
Now i'm just like everyone else
Damn it's good to be a punk

I'm just a poser
I'm just a loser, a dreamer, a geek
I'm just someone who will spend his life
Lying to you while you lie to me

Now i'd do about anything
Just so i could be a punk
Got a mohawk dyed it green
Just so i could be a punk
Denounced nirvana and the pumpkins
Just so i could be a punk
Now i'm just like everyone else
Damn it's good to be a punk
