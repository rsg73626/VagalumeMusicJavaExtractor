WINTER OF DISILLUSIONMENT

My faith is bruised and my convictions guilty
Of questioning why I've been forgiven
This grace, the state I'm in?
My manifest's spiritual hypothesis

Winter's coming
To destroy what spring created
Winter's coming
To destroy spring

I can't digest their dogma
I feel the bile rising in my throat
Society's hypocrisy
Tries to take away my hope
They disfigure Christ
To fit inside their mind
Blasphemy
They claim sight but they're all blind

Dogma dictates their sins and beliefs
They stand stagnant on hypocrisy
Blindness leads to disfiguring
Hiding the truth behind their beliefs

Chorus

My faith is bruised and I reject tradition
Dogma dictates their sins and beliefs
All the fools and their self proclaimed wisdom
They stand stagnant on hypocrisy
Obstacles and Ignorance
Blindness leads to disfiguring
Standing between the world and God's gift
