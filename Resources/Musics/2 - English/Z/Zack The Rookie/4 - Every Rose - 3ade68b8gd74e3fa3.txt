EVERY ROSE

Forgotton perversions, bathe the truth in fallacy
Ignore the blood just try to breathe
Headstones with starry eyes tell stories of past memories
Ignore the blood just try to breathe
Transcendent qualities manufactured by denial
Ignore the blood just try to breathe
Rising flames reflect a skull frozen in a smile
Ignore the blood, ignore the blood

In this garden where there grows twisted metal and broken concrete
Acrobatic combustion these flowers grow extroverted
Every rose is an addict waiting for another hit
Every rose is an addict, every rose is an addict

These thorns are hypodermic
She's crying out in disbelief
Inject a mother with this serum of dysphoria
She's crying out in disbelief
Tie an arm, tap a vein, just let it kill the pain
She's crying out in disbelief
Tie an arm, tap a vein, just let it kill the pain
She's crying out

In this garden where there grows twisted metal and broken concrete
Acrobatic combustion these flowers grow extroverted
Every rose is an addict waiting for another hit
Every rose is an addict, every rose is an addict
