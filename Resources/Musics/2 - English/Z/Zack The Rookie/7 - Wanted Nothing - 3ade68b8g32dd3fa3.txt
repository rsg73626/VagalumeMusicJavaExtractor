WANTED NOTHING

Why's the quiet so damn loud
I can't hear myself screaming
Need to find myself a crowd
Cause I can't stop myself from thinking
About the way things used to be
About her heart which I can't reach
About all the things I see
Here in this insanity

Would've loved you forever but
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANTED
Would've given you the world but
FROM ME IT MEANT NOTHING
Would've given you all of me but
I'M NOT WHAT YOU WANTED
I can't believe I ever loved you
I REALIZE YOU'RE NOTHING

Deafened by my contemplation
The voices always scream inside
When you left my heart was vacant
And my life was just a lie
Hurt because I dared to dream
Of a life for you and me
What the fuck was I thinking?
Consumed by love's insanity

Chorus

I REALIZE YOU'RE NOTHING
I REALIZE YOU'RE NOTHING
I REALIZE YOU'RE NOTHING

You always make the same mistakes
You can't help it, it's just part of your nature
And you react to fear
Stimuli directs your actions
But I don't have to accept you
Like you are
Or what you do
And when you push me away
I can leave
I am free
FREE
FREE
FREE TO GO

And when I think of you
I thank God you're not with me
And when I think of you
I thank God that finally

I realize you're nothing
I realize you're nothing
I realize you're nothing
I realize you're nothing
