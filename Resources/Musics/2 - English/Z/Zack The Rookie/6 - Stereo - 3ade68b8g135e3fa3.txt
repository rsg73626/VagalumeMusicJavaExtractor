STEREO

I'm a virus, an infection in this arterial america
I'm a part of you, and you're a part of me.
Symbiotic? Parasitic? I don't know which one yet
But I know that you keep feeding, keep feeding me.

Yeah, yeah, a kiss from this syringe
Yeah, yeah, whispers truth under your skin
Your life moves to my heartbeat
I'm the oxygen you breath, you'll never get rid of me
I'm the dream that keeps you up at night
Still there when you open your eyes
The hidden truth in all your little lies

Yeah, yeah, a kiss from this syringe
Yeah, yeah, whispers truth under your skin
I'm the blood that's pumping though your stereo.
