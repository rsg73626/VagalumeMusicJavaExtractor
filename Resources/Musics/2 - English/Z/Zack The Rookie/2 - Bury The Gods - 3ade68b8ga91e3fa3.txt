BURY THE GODS

Can you hear the horrorshow choir sing hymns of redemption?
The circuitry of denial is a deity to believe in
So start a fire and plant a pipe bomb on the g-spot of your greed
After all we're only human, so let's destroy humanity

Olympus has crumbled
Will you help me bury the gods?

I'm tired of dreaming in shades of grey
with charcoal tears running down my face
Revisit the physics of human emotion
The erosion of choices misled by empty voices

Olympus has crumbled
Will you help me bury the gods?

In my dreams these flames burn black and white and they're asking,
"How far can you fall?"
This question burns brighter than their light and keeps asking,
"How far can you fall?"
