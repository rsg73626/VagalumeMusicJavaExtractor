BY US MEMORY

I want to know what you think about me
But I can’t go to you

I want
You want
But we don’t know that this can be right
We lie that we don’t like
And the time goes
And can’t back

I stay alone
And you too
And now
The memory stay only this…

You are in my memory
I am in your memory
We are in us memory
You are in my memory
I am in your memory
And We can change all

You are my best thing on the past
And I don’t go to without you
But Now It’s look to the future
But know that your heart is my heart
And that you is thinking in me…

You are in my memory
I am in your memory
We are in us memory
You are in my memory
I am in your memory
And We can change all

And now It’s look to the future
Know that your heart is my heart
Maybe you is thinking… in me

On the past…
