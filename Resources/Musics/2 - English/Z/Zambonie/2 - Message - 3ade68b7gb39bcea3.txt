MESSAGE

Painful truth you come and hurt me
I’m not worthy of this kind of abuse
I think I could fit in your shoes
If you tell me nothing but the truth

So here we are at crossroads of yours and mine
We can make it if we work things out this time
Let me tell you how I feel tonight
Tomorrow’s too late

I’m not perfect like you want me
I just pretend, I’m such a loser
I know you don’t want to hurt me
But you words just cut me to little pieces
