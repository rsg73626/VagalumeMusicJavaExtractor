THE SUN NEVER CAME

I wish that I could change the story line
I wish that I could take you out of my life
You’ll never know how much that knife hurts
In my heart, that knife is your words

This is my last thought
This is the last song
This is the last dream
So I can move on
You ruined my life
I’ll never be the same
Even if I could
The sun never came

Like a bullet fired into the head of my soul
You left it and me for dead
Take back you paintings and all your photographs
And save them for someone else

Burn down the bridges and forget we happened
Just go away
go away…
