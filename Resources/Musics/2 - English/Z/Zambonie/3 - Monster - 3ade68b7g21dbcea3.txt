MONSTER

Someone told me long before you knew
Known what you had done
You fail to see this hypocrisy, you just laugh
Look at what you’ve become
A monster that hates and kills, killing me, killing you,
Killing all the things you do
But you don’t do much anymore, you just kill
And you kill, and you kill…

How do you like yourself now
With your feet up in the air you hit the ground
With your feet up in the air

So it’s come to this, my loneliness
My broken heart cries out
The tears that you caused,
You had the world in your hands, you threw it all away
I wish you could change,
I wish you could change yourself, turn it inside out
But inside i know you just kill and you kill and you kill…
