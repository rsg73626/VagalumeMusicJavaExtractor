YOU’RE ALL RIGHT

Never Knowing
Where I’m going
I feel so empty
I think God hates me

You treat me like your pawn, I want to be your knight
But now I sit and wonder if you’re all right
If you’re all right

I can’t see you
Every night
If you wanna see me
Then just close your eyes

Everything comes to an end
But you still want to be friends
Well you slammed me
And you think that it’s all right
Now I know that I can’t see you every night
