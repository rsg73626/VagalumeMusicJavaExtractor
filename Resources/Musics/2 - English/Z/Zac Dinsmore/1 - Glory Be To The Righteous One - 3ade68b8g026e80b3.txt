GLORY BE TO THE RIGHTEOUS ONE

Verse 1
Longing for the return of the saviour who paid my debt
With blood He saved my life and claim my soul from death

Pre-Chorus
For I know, the time is coming soon
Lord I wanna be ready for You, so hear my cry
With one voice, we will sing this song
To hasten the splitting sky, we let it rise

Chorus
The Spirit and the bride say, "Come"
Glory be to the righteous
Sing this song until You come
Glory be to the righteous

Verse2
I'm yearning for the return of the lover who's ravished me
He chase me down and jealous love pursue my heart
Preparing for the fairest of bridegroom to take my hand
With loving soul, my heart and soul, He won't let go

Bridge
It doesn't matter what the world is singing
I will lift my voice until I see Him
It doesn't matter what the world is screaming
I know He's coming soon and so I'm singing
