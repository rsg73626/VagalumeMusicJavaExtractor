One rainy day in december
The sky was cloudy and gray
I said farewell to the city of stone
They say there is an island
Where people sing this way
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a

Sad to be lonely
Good to be free
Sad to be lonely
Good to be free
As a bird not a care in the world
Gonna fly here and fly there and everywhere

I stole away in a sail-boat
The wind blew heavy all night
But if you break off be very strong
I seemed too hear the sound of a far away voice, it
singing
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a

Sad to be lonely
Good to be free
Sad to be lonely
Good to be free
As a bird not a care in the world
Gonna fly here and fly there and everywhere

A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a

A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a

A lonely tropical island
A paradise in the sun
As I was taking a breath of fresh air
Two thousand motor cars and the sound of a telephone
it ringing

A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a
A-a u-a-e
E-e-u-a-a
Sad to be lonely
Good to be free
Sad to be lonely
Good to be free
As a bird not a care in the world
Gonna fly here and fly there and everywhere
