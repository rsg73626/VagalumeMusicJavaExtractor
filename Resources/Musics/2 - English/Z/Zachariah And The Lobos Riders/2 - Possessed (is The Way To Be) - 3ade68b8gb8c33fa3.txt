POSSESSED (IS THE WAY TO BE)

Alright, let's try to get this right on the first take, for cryin' out loud 
One, two 

Well, I've had my car, my phone, 
My trailer, my home repossessed 
And I've had my boots, my wife, 
My truck and my life repossessed 

But I never thought it would happen to me 
It feels as if the government came after me 
I've been possessed by a spirit from beyond the grave 
I've become the afterlife's loyal slave 
They've repossessed nearly everything from me 
So I've reassessed my situation and possessed is the way to be 

Well, I've had my harp, my sink 
My pipe and my drinks repossessed 
And I had my dog, my beer 
My mom and my tears repossessed 

But I never thought it would happen to me 
It feels as if the government came after me 
Yeah, I've been possessed by a spirit from beyond the grave 
Well, I've become the afterlife's loyal slave 
Well who'd have guessed that they'd take everything from me? 
I've reassessed my situation and possessed is the way to be 
Let's go! 

Now I've had my body, my mind 
My soul and my time repossessed 
And I've had my horse, my clothes 
My eyes, ears and nose repossessed 

But I can't believe I let this happen to me 
It feels as if the government came after me 
I've been possessed by spirits from beyond the grave 
I've become the afterlife's loyal slave 
But I pay no bills and all my plumbing's free 
'cause I reassessed my situation and possessed is the way to be 
I got no job, and that's just fine by me 
'cause I reassessed my situation and possessed is the way to be 
I'll prob'ly live to be one hundred and sixty-three 
I reassessed my situation and possessed is the way to be
