THESE ARE THE DAYS

These are the days we're making up as we go
We drift through the hollows to find the old road
Don't remember days of your sorrow
Remember when you heard the call
Carry today & tomorrow

And rightly count the who's and whens
Some people say money, and others say plans
But I'm hungry for freedom that never changes hands
Spring, summer and autumn leave me restless
Will winter bring its peace to man?
But hidden in time there is a constant

If we can only enter in
I've been to your house once
The doors were tall & wide
So I was surprised when it was warm inside
Take me to a room I can lay down in
And let me hear the songs they sing
Or quiet my mind - let me hear softly
The simple song you're whispering
