CITY

City of gold, city of face
City of love, city - no base
City undone, city low play
City street-drunk, city turns none away
And we saw through our windows
Every door where the men go

She was low cut, she was dumb-faced
A ribbon of lust wherever she lay
See her undone, see her freeze-frame
See her drunk li (m) p, see her tease play
And we watch still as she goes downhill
City hangs out where the beasts sway

City's passed out in the hallway
Before she fell down what did she say?
"I haven't seen a bird in twenty-three of these days"
To say we told her so was no thrill
But we don't mind a quiet kill
