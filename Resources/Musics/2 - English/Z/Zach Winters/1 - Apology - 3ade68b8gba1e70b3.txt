APOLOGY

Sorry love
I didn't mean to hurt you, I apologize
I love your hands
Please come out
Out from behind the red holly tree
I'll prune their horns
Foolish tongue
Speak kindly to a lady, your ever-wife
And wash her arms
Holy light
See it - through the window of her skin
A mirror shines
Sorry, love
I didn't mean to hurt you, I apologize
Know I love you
