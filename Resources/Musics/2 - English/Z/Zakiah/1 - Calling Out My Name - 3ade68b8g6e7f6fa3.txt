CALLING OUT MY NAME

Chorus:
Baby I want you
I'm gonna have you
Callin' out my name

Honey I like your style
Why don't you stay for a while
And let me love you?
Oh baby

Tell me you got it goin' on
And now it's time to put me on
And let me love you
Oh baby

Give me your lovin'
Kissin'and huggin'
Bein'your baby
That's what I'm thinkin'
I'm not afraid, boy
To let you in my heart
I'll keep you happy
Baby, you will see

Repeat Chorus Twice

I wanna love you up and down
Movin' my body all around
Just let me love you
Oh baby
So now that you know
Won't you let your feelings go
And let me love you?
Oh baby

Give me your lovin'
Kissin' and huggin'
Being your baby
That's what I'm thinkin'
I'm not afraid, boy
To let you in my heart
I'll keep you happy
Baby, you will see

Repeat Chorus Twice

Let me, let me
Let me love you
All night long
Let me, let me
Let me do you right

Repeat Chorus and fade...
