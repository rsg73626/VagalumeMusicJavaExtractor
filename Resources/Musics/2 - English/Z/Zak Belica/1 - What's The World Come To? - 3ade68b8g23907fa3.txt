WHAT'S THE WORLD COME TO?

What's the world come to
When everything's going the way of the gun
What's the world come to
If life is a shadow of what has been done

I want you to know
Don't take it slow
Just come undone
And the sin will take hold
I can't hold it back
It's too much to ask
You know the way
You're up to the task
But please don't ever say

What's the world come to
When bullets are all that you can undestand
What's the world come to
When all that I touch will leave blood on my hands

I want you to know
Don't take it slow
Just come undone
And the sin will take hold
I can't hold it back
It's too much to ask
You know the way
You're up to the task
But please don't ever say

What's the world come to

What's it all come to
Nothing to see through
It's all been spoken
Shattered and broken
Give it to me

Don't tell me
What's the world come to
