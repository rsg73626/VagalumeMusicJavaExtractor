ALLAH KNOWS

When you feel all alone in this world
And there's nobody to count your tears
Just remember, no matter where you are
Allah Knows, Allah knows
When you're carrying a monster load
And you wonder how far you can go
With every step on that road that you take
Allah knows, Allah knows

CHORUS   No matter what, inside or out
               There's one thing of which, there's no doubt
               Allah knows, Allah knows
               And whatever lies in the heavens and the earth
               Every star in this whole universe
               Allah knows, Allah knows

When you find that special someone
Feel your whole life has barely begun
You can walk on the moon, shout it to everyone
Allah knows, Allah knows
When you gaze with love in your eyes
Catch a glimpse of paradise
And you see your child take the first breath of life
Allah knows, Allah knows

CHORUS

When you lose someone close to your heart
See your whole world fall apart
And you try to go on but it seems so hard
Allah knows, Allah knows
You see we all have a path to choose
Through the valleys and hills we go
With the ups and the downs, never fret, never frown
Allah knows, Allah knows

CHORUS 2x

Every grain of sand
In every desert land, he knows
Every shade of palm
Every closed hand, he knows
Every sparkling tear
On every eyelash, he knows
Every thought I have
And every word I share, he knows
Allah knows
