LORD OF ALL THE WORLDS

In the name, of Allah 
Lord of all the Worlds
There is no God but Him
the Living, the Eternal
His throne extends
over the heavens, and the earth
He alone do we worship
He alone we ask for help
Show us the straight path
The path of those You love
Protect us from all evil
From the path of those astray
O Provider of all things
To You we turn each day
O Merciful Creator
only to You we pray
