SPREAD THE WORLD

We are the Muslim Ummah
And each day that goes by the harder we try
In gratitude we pray to Allah
Chosen as part of the best of Mankind
We spread the word of Islam
Each minute, Each Hour
In awe of His power
Each Flower, Each Tree
Everything that we see
Chorus:
Spread the word O' Man
Spread the word Islam
Oh Fortunate One
Paradise must be won (x2)
Each Day and each night
Through Darkness and Light
Cry it out to the World
Spread the Word, Spread the Word
Spread the Word O' Man, Spread the Word of Islam
Every difficulty faced in our lives
Makes us realise that it's just part of Allah's plan
Feeling stronger we take it in our stride
He will always favour the patient one
While we spread the word of Islam
Every sigh, sad goodbye
Every tear from my eye
Every yes, every no
Every high, every low
Chorus
