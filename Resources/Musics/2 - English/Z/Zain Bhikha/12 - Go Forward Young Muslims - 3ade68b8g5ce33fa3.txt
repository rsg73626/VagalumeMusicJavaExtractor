GO FORWARD YOUNG MUSLIMS

Go forward young Muslims, 
wherever you are
In the shadow of the sun or by the light 
of a star
Your supreme protector is Almighty Allah
Go forward young Muslims, 
wherever you are
Go forward young Muslims, 
whoever you are
Press forward and forward to the light 
of Allah
And repeat and repeat, 
al-Hamdu li 'Llah
Go forward and forward, 
whoever you are
Go forward young Muslims, 
say bismi 'Llah
Together we shall stand for the pleasure 
of Allah
He'll forgive us all, say insha'a 'Llah
Go forward young Muslims, 
al-Hamdu li 'Llah
Go forward young Muslims, 
wherever you are
Go forward young Muslims, 
al-Hamdu li 'Llah
