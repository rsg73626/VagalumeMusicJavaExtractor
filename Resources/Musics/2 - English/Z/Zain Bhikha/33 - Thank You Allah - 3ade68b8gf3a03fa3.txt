THANK YOU ALLAH

When I wake up in the morning
What do I say?
Thank you Allah for this beautiful day
I sit down my breakfast
My porridge I eat
I pray to Allah for the people on the street
I go to school
About Islam I have to know
What about those people who can't afford 
to go
And when it's time for me in bed to be
I thank Allah for everything He's given me
