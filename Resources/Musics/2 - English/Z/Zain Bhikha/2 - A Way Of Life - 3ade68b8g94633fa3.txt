A WAY OF LIFE

Do you know what Islam is?
It's a way of life for all
It is taught in the Qur'an
For big and small
Chorus:
A way of life, a way of life
A way of life, a way of life
Islam is a way of life
A complete way
Do you know what Islam says?
It says that life's the greatest test
It says that life's a borrowed space
Returned upon rest
Chorus
Islam solves all of it's problems
Allah leaves no stone unturned
Perfect with no flaws at all
Are the laws of Allah
Chorus
