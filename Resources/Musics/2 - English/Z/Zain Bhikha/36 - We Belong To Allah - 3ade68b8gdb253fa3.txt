WE BELONG TO ALLAH

The earth on which we walk
The sky above so high is Allah's work
To Him we belong, to Him we'll return
Ya Allah, to You I pray
What did you bring me in this world for?
To live for Islam and You, Allah
Obey our Prophet, Rasulu 'Llah salla 'Llahu ‘alayhi wa sallam
The air that we breath
Everything we see
Is created by Allah
So why do we live?
And why do we die?
It's all for Allah, don't you see?
Shaytan will try to make us stray from Islam
But we are strong, we have iman
Together we'll stand as Musalman
O Allah, keep us on the straight path
All over the world
They see that we are strong
In our beliefs
They'll try to bring us down
And make us lose iman
For Allah's sake, I will fight for our Islam
As in the times of the Sahaba
They fought for the Prophet and his Ummah
They fought for the pleasure of You, Allah
Brothers and sisters so must we
The earth on which we walk
The sky above so high is Allah's work
To Him we belong, to Him we'll return
Ya Allah, to You I pray
What did you bring me in this world for?
To live for Islam and You, Allah

A Child's Prayer
I sometimes lie awake at night
And wonder at the stars so bright
I dream about my future too
And the things that I will do
Soon the world will count on me
I'm the future, they agree
People depend on me somehow
Though small and timid, I am now
So you and I my dearest friend
Must stand together till the end
For we are one by Allah's grace 
No matter what our creed or race
We must prepare ourselves today
While we journey on life's way
So education we must crave
From the cradle to the grave
So those entrusted with our care
Train us please and do your share
We'll make you proud of us somehow
So waste no time and teach us now
We need your love and tender care
Your sincere and ardent prayer
So much there is to learn and see
For true believers we must be
O Allah we love you so
Give us health and make us grow
Be with us each passing day
While we journey on life's way
