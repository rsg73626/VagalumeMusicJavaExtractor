HUSH LITTLE BABY

Hush little baby, pure and small
He created you, He created us all
Hush little baby, don't you fear
We're never alone when Allah's so near
Hush little, breathing so calm
He'll protect us all and keep us from harm
Hush little baby, still and serene
You are a Muslim, Islam's your din (x2)
