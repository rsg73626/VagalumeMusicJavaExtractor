MOUNT HIRA

The same moon, the same star
Gazed right down at rasulu 'Llah
They saw him climb, down from Hira
Now a Prophet, Prophet of Allah
And in the sky, was angel Jibra'il
He said O Muhammad, O rasulu 'Llah
And so he walked, into Makkah
In his heart echoed Iqra, Iqra
And from the world, darkness was gone
with salvation, rising with dawn
for here was a blessing, a gift from Allah
and the light of Muhammad, outshone that star
Chorus:
Muhammad is, and always will be
the last and final Prophet of Allah
He was a mercy, unto the universe
peace and blessings be on al-Mustafa
So he began, this perfect man
SendIng hIs word, across the land
leading only, by his sunnah
And the Quran, the word of Allah
He brought the answer to this cruel world
Our beloved Prophet, Muhammad
Chorus:
So from that cave, in Mount Hira
To the holy city of Madinah
in life and death, he showed Islam
Opened our hearts to the wealth of Iman
So o Allah, hear my duâ€˜a
Keep me as part of the Prophets ummah
Chorus:
The same moon, the same star
Gazed right down at rasulu 'Llah
They saw him climb, down from Hira
Now a Prophet, Prophet of Allah
And in the sky, was angel Jibra'il
He said O Muhammad, O rasulu 'Llah
He said O Muhammad, Nabi of Allah
He said O Muhammad, Prophet of Allah
