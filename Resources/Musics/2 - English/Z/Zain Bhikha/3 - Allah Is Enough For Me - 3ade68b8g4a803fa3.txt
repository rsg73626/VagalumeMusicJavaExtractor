ALLAH IS ENOUGH FOR ME

(the story of Prophet Yusuf)
When he was placed in the well
or locked in the dungeon
betrayed by his own flesh and blood
convicted of what he did not
handsome Yusuf sighed
Allah is enough for me! 
Taken in as a slave
made to work night and day
resisting all temptation
Allah is enough for me!
Until the king had a dream
Many hard years had gone by
patience and repentance
Allah is enough for me!
Till...the fortunate day
there he sees his father
in the land of content
Allah is enough for me!
Handsome Yusuf cried
Allah is enough for me!
Every night brings a new day
Allah alleviates all pain
Everything has its end
Allah is enough for me!
Everything has its end
Allah is enough for me!
Allah is enough for me!
