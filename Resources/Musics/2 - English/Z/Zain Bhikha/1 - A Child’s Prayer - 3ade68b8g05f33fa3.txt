A CHILDâ€™S PRAYER

I sometimes lie awake at night
And wonder at the stars so bright
I dream about my future too
And the things that I will do
Soon the world will count on me
I'm the future, they agree
People depend on me somehow
Though small and timid, I am now
So you and I my dearest friend
Must stand together till the end
For we are one by Allah's grace 
No matter what our creed or race
We must prepare ourselves today
While we journey on life's way
So education we must crave
From the cradle to the grave
So those entrusted with our care
Train us please and do your share
We'll make you proud of us somehow
So waste no time and teach us now
We need your love and tender care
Your sincere and ardent prayer
So much there is to learn and see
For true believers we must be
O Allah we love you so
Give us health and make us grow
Be with us each passing day
While we journey on life's way
