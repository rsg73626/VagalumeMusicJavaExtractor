CLOUD OF ISLAM

You know, from the start 
A message was sent from above 
A message so clear and so true 
A message so final for you 
The time has come 
To let the whole world know 
This message of peace and love 
Came only from Allah above... 
Chorus: 
Have faith, step onto the cloud of Islam 
And you will discover the light of Iman 
Proclaim this message entrusted to you 
And the cloud of Islam... will carry you 
You know, for all Man 
messengers were sent to guide 
From Adam to Nuh to Musa 
Ibrahim, Isma?il, ?Isa 
Then came, Muhammad 
the last and final messenger 
confirming what was said before 
perfecting this din of Allah 
Chorus 
I know that its not always easy to see 
the difference from right and wrong, what would it be 
but people this message lies here in our hands 
Happiness, peace and the answer for Man 
Chorus 
So now, don?t you see 
Inviting to Allah should be 
every Muslims responsibility 
Everybody, you and me 
Chorus
