I AM A MUSLIM

When I was born, the first words that I 
had heard
Were the words of Allah being whispered through my ear
And as I felt Allah's power in my soul
That day Islam took me in it's fold
Chorus:
I am a Muslim
Islam my din
Allah my Lord
His word Qur'an
Muhammad, Prophet
Praise be upon him
I am a Muslim for all of time
As I grew up, walking in this great big world
I gazed in awe at the wonders of Allah
And as I learned the cruel lessons of life
Islam shone through as my guiding light
Chorus
Look at me now, family around my deathbed
I know not when Allah will call me home
This life I led, o what a blessed thing
As death comes to me these words I 
will sing
Chorus (x2)
