MUSLIM SCHOOL ANTHEM

All praise is due to Allah
For what he's given us for today
And in the morning that will come
We'll face the bright tomorrow
We, the Pretoria Muslim school
We learn to live for Allah
And side by side we'll always stand
The Ummah of rasulu 'Llah
As long as we believe in You, we'll never 
go astray
Our five namazes we will pray
O Ya Allah! That's what we'll say
And in the month of Ramadan
We'll fast and strengthen our iman
O Allah! Protect us all with Your help we will not fall
La ilaha illa 'Llah
Muhammadu 'r-rasulu 'Llah
As long as we believe in You
We'll never go astray
We walk the halls of learning
To clarify our vision
The flame of truth is burning
For our iman will never die 
We are the children of Islam
Together we'll stand as Musalman
The Ummah of rasulu 'Llah
The servants of only Allah
As long as we believe in You
We'll never go astray
As long as You are in our hearts
We'll never go astray
