INTRODUCTION

O Mankind!
We created you from a single pair of male and female and made you
Into different nations and tribes, that you may know each other.
Verily, the most honoured of you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you.
And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted with all things!
Qur'an 49:13
