TALA‘A ’L-BADRU ‘ALAYNA

Tala‘a 'l-badru ‘alayna 
min thaniyyati 'l-wada' 
wajaba 'sh-shukru ‘alayna
ma da‘a li 'Llahi da‘
O the white moon rose over us
From the valley of wada'
And we owe it to show gratefulness
Where the call is to Allah 
Tala‘a 'l-badru ‘alayna 
min thaniyyati 'l-wada' 
wajaba 'sh-shukru ‘alayna
ma da‘a li 'Llahi da‘
Hmm, rasulu 'Llah, rasulu 'Llah, rasulu 'Llah, rasulu 'Llah
Nabiyu 'Llah, Nabiyu 'Llah, Nabi of Allah, Nabiyu 'Llah
Ayyuha 'l-mab‘uthu fina 
ji'ta bi-al-amri 'l-muta‘
ji'ta sharafta 'l-madina
marhaban ya khayra da'
O you who were raised amongst us
Coming with a word to be obeyed
You have brought to this city nobleness
Welcome! best caller to God's way 
Ayyuha 'l-mab‘uthu fina 
ji'ta bi-al-amri 'l-muta‘
ji'ta sharafta 'l-madina
marhaban ya khayra da'
Hmm, rasulu 'Llah, habibu 'Llah, nabi of Allah, shafi‘u 'Llah
rasulu 'Llah, habibu 'Llah, nabi of Allah, shafi‘u 'Llah
Tala‘a 'l-badru ‘alayna 
min thaniyyati 'l-wada' 
wajaba 'sh-shukru ‘alayna
ma da‘a li 'Llahi da‘
Ayyuha 'l-mab‘uthu fina 
ji'ta bi-al-amri 'l-muta‘
ji'ta sharafta 'l-madina
