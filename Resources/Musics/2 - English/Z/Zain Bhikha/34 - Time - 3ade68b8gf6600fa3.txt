TIME

Driving past, walking fast 
To the field of dreams, hear the children screams 
Every corner represents, a different image in my mind 
A momentary emotion, space banked in time 
In time 
Memories fade like a dusty window pain 
And you can't see you past no more 
The only thing that remains is that feeling of warmth 
In your heart that will always be there&#133; be there 
An immortal smile, stays only for a while 
But down the line, it strengthens us inside 
We all live the illusion of many days to come 
Not realizing that tomorrow lies with Allah 
The only One, 
The Only One 
Time goes by on the wings of a butterfly 
And what goes with it is all that you have 
So take the best of every moment, take the best of every man 
Then move on and don't ever look back.. Don&#146;t look back
