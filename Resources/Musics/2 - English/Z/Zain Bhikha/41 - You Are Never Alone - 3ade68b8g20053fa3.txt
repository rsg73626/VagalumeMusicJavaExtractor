YOU ARE NEVER ALONE

Sometimes, when the world's not on your side
You don't know where to run to
You don't know where to hide.
You gaze, at the stars in the sky
At the mountains so high
Through the tears in your eyes.
Looking for a reason,
to replace what is gone.
Just remember, remember
That you are never alone.
You are never alone (you are never alone)
Just reach into your heart
And Allah is always there.
You are never alone (you are never alone)
Through sorrow and through grief
Through happiness and peace
You are never alone.
So now as you long for your past
Prepare for your future
But knowing nothings going to last
You see this life is but a road
A straight and narrow path
To our final abode
So travel well O Muslim
And Paradise will be your home
And always remember
That you are never alone.
You are never alone (you are never alone)
Just reach into your heart
And Allah is always there.
You are never alone (Allah is there)
Through sorrow and through grief
Through happiness and peace
You are never alone.
You are never alone (you are never never alone)
Just reach into your heart
And Allah is always there.
You are never alone (you are never alone)
Through sorrow and through grief
Through happiness and peace
You are never alone.
