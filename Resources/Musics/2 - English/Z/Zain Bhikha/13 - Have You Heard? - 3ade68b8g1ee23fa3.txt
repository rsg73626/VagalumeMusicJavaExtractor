HAVE YOU HEARD?

Each day we are reminded
and each day we say
there's not much that we can do
it seems so far away
So we live our lives in silence
pretending not to hear
the voices of our people
The cry is so so clear
Why do we stand by spectating
while our brothers cry jihad?
We are bound by one conviction:
we believe in Allah
Chorus:
Have you heard of Kosova, of Afghanistan?
Have you heard of Palestine [2nd chorus: Bosnia]
of Chechan?
Have you heard of all these people
persecuted in their land?
Do you know that all these people are dying for Islam?
Have you heard, have you heard
have you heard?
Each day is like another
Nothing seems to change
Today he'll lose his brother
Tomorrow will be the same
Yet his faith makes him stronger
he's come so so far
The pain in his heart is eased
by his love for Allah
O I envy you my brother
in adversity you pray
You know that heaven awaits you
at the end of this day
Chorus
