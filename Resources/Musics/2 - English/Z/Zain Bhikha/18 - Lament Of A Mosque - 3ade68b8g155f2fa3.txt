LAMENT OF A MOSQUE

I want to know
Where you've been for so long?
I want to know
Why you've left me alone?
I want to know
What has attracted you so?
O dear Muslim, I really would like to know
I want to know
Why you come on â€˜Eid day only?
I want to know
Why you come for Ramadan only?
O please do tell me
I really would like to know
O Muslim don't you see?
For your marriage you came to me
And there's one thing that will always be
That the last place you visit before the grave will be me
