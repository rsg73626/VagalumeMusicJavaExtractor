FAREWELL

Assalaamu 'alaikum warahmatullah
Brothers and Sisters we all love RasulAllah
Our journey goes on, this journey for Allah
Forward as Muslims for the sake of akhirah
To my teachers and friends I stand before you
May the blessings of Almighty Allah shine on you
You have passed onto me your wisdom and your love
With the heart of a lion and the wings of a dove.
Assalaamu 'alaikum warahmatullah
Brothers and Sisters we all love RasulAllah
Our journey goes on, this journey for Allah
Forward as Muslims for the sake of akhirah.
To my mother and father, my pillar so strong
You've always been there
Guiding me to right from wrong
May Allah fill your days with happiness you see
Don't ever forget how special you are to me.
Assalaamu 'alaikum warahmatullah
Brothers and Sisters we all love RasulAllah
Our journey goes on, this journey for Allah
Forward as Muslims for the sake of akhirah.
Here we are O Allah
The children of Islam
Guide us, protect us from the evil of shaytaan
You have blessed us with teachings from the Holy Qur'an
And the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, al Mukhtaar.
Assalaamu 'alaikum warahmatullah
Brothers and Sisters we all love RasulAllah
Our journey goes on, this journey for Allah
Forward as Muslims for the sake of akhirah.
Assalaamu 'alaikum warahmatullah
