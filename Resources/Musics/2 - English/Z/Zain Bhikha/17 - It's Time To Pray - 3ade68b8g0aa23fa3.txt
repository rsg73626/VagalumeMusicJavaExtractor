IT'S TIME TO PRAY

Boys and girls, it's time to pray
Adhan is called five times a day
Stop your playing and leave your sleep
Ignore the noises in the street
Pack up your toys and leave your games
Remember Allah, most Glorious of names
Come in a hurry, come clean and smart
Speak to your Maker and open your heart
Praise and thank Him all day long
And say you're sorry if you've done wrong
He'll forgive you all and give you the power
To think and do good each second and 
hour (x2)
