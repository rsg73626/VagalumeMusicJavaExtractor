ORPHAN CHILD

She was just standing there, little girl all alone 
Barely covered head to toe, barely just twelve years old 
Why is she all alone, why's the world just so cold 
Why don't we play our part what has hardened our hearts? 
What has hardened our hearts? 

Underneath the waterfall, million dollar shopping mall 
Two boys play their games, helps to keep them nice and warm 
Thousand people walking by, feeding their vain desire 
Don't they see, are they blind, Allah loves the orphan child 
Allah loves the orphan child 

Like our Beloved Muhammad, Peace be upon Him 
He was an orphan and Allah sheltered him 
What status is given to these children&#133; children? 

Just by the riverside, right next to that orphan child 
Families come to play, they don't see that's where she stays 
Looking through empty eyes, who cares that she might die 
O my child, don't you cry, Allah loves you more than I 
Allah Love's you more 

She was standing there, barely just twelve years old 
What has hardened our hearts, why's the world just so cold.
