WEDDING SONG

Chorus:
Nikahun mubarakun
zawajun mubarakun
an-nikahu min-sunnati
ma qala 'n-nabi huwa 's-sahih
nikahun mubarakun
Today you become man and wife
fulfilling the sunna as way of life
Today you'll find serenity
may your life be filled with sincerity
There is no happier day in your life
than the virtue of being man and wife
There's joy without any end
Allah's blessing on this day does descend...descend
Chorus
As you walk together, hand in hand
Allah has given you a companion and friend
To stand, and always be seen
as man and wife, fulfilling their din
From this day on, forever be true
cherish this life that's destined for you
Live your life with kindness and care
remember, Allah will always be there...be there
Chorus
There is joy, there is happiness
in this union, let there always be bliss
Allah will bless your home with light
your heart with never-ending delight
Two worlds today have now become one
the road ahead is as bright as the sun
O Allah, keep this marriage so strong
in Your hands does their future belong...belong
Chorus
