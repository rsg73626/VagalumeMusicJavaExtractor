SMALL

I never meant to hurt your feelings
I never meant to make you blue
Funny how one can start with good intentions
And wind up doing exactly
What they meant not to do
I didn't want to lose you

I never meant to put up this wall
And now it looks like I'm a gutless liar
And I'm feeling very small
Yeah, I'm feeling very small
We all lose our way
Yeah, we all lose our way

And I know that that's just an excuse
But it's true just the same
And that's my side of the story
That's the reason why I called
And I guess you probably hate me
But if it's any consolation I feel very small
Yeah, I feel very small
I feel very small
I feel very small
