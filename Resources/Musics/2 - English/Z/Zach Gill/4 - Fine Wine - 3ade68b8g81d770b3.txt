FINE WINE

Maybe we didn't write the book
Maybe we left out that page
Or maybe we're like fine wine
Getting better with age
Well I think it's time that you arrived
Inside your heart and inside your mind
Cause you're beautiful and I see it
And I see you starting to believe it

You're beautiful and I see it
And I see you starting to believe it
You're beautiful and I see it
And I see you starting to believe it
Believing it's true
Believing it's true
Believing it's true

And I know you've got regrets
And I know you feel undone
But when I look at your life
It looks to me like your life
Has been made out of love
And I think it's time that you arrived
Inside your heart and inside your mind
Cause you're beautiful and I see it
And I see you starting to believe it

You're beautiful and I see it
And I see you starting to believe it
You're beautiful and I see it
And I see you starting to believe it

Believing it's true
Believing it's true
Believing it's true
Believing it's true
Believing it's true
Believing it's true
