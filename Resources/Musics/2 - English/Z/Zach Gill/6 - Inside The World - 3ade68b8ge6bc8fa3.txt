INSIDE THE WORLD

blinded by the sun
staring at what I feel
my ears begin to open
and my mind begins to clear

I'm inside the world and world is in me
I'm inside the air that swings the trees
I'm inside the world and the world is in we
gonna build ourselves a circle
and fill up with what we belive

what is ilusion and what is real
if you can't belive in what you see
than belive in what you feel

I'm inside the world and world is in me
I'm inside the air that swings the trees
I'm inside the world and the world is in we
gonna build ourselves a circle
and fill up with what we belive

I can feel myself still breathing
so I know that I'm alive
I'm gonna stand above the valley
and let my dream, spread their wings
and flow
