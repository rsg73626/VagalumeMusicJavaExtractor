BEAUTIFUL REASON

You don't know me, but I know you
In times of trouble, your words
Have helped pull me through
Sun is in your vision, possibilities
Emerge from the dark
Start off with just a spark
And suddenly the room's ablaze
With new ideas and sunny days

Ahh you, you got a beautiful reason
Ahh you, you got a beautiful reason
Too many programs open at once
A heart gets caught inside ones thoughts
Tangled emotions between pause and rewind

Try to find a way to make more time
But things are the way they are
Ahh you, you got a beautiful reason
Ahh you, you got a beautiful reason
Gonna try to get caught up in a
Momentary lapse- oh
