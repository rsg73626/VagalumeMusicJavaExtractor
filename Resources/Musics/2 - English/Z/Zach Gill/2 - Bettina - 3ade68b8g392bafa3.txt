BETTINA

She was my neighbor in the EPA,
smoked a pack on Menthols almost every day.
And in the morning we would hear her croon
as she coughed up her lungs outside our bedroom
She said, My name is Bettina

Yeah, but you can call me Betty
and when you gonna give me some liquor already?
do do dodo dodo do dodo do do..
She had a short term memory,
I know because she'd always ask me
The same questions again and again
like, when you gonna let me sit in with your band?

She said, my name is Bettina
Yeah, but you can call me Betty
and when you gonna give me some liquor already?
do do dodo dodo do dodo do do..
It was the chapest rent we could find
in East Palo Alto, double wind

Houses built to the new
but they weren't goin' anywhere anytime soon
She had a bind on her finger tip
from trying to feed a squirrel with corn chip
I think about her every once in a while
and whenever I do, it always makes me smile

She said, My name is Bettina
Yeah, but you can call me Betty
She said, My name is Bettina
and is you need me I'll be ready
She said, My name is Bettina
Yeah, but you can call me Betty
and when you gonna have me over 
for some liquor already?
do do dodo dodo do dodo do do...
