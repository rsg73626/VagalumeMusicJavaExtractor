LONG

I picture you long and beautiful
Stretching out into the universe, unrehearsed
Guided by instincts the night light is on
I picture you long and beautiful
I picture you long and beautiful

Well I've been thinkin'
And maybe that's where the problem starts
Don't need to be thinkin'
Just need to be listenin' with our hearts
And you'll know that where ever you go
My love is traveling with you
My love is traveling with you

I picture you long and beautiful
Stretching out into the universe
Guided by instincts, the night light is on
I picture you- long and beautiful
