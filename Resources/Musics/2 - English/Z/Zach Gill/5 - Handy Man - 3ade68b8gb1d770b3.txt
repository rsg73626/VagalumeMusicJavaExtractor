HANDY MAN

Well, I'm not so good at
Fixin' the belts on the vcr
Not so good at changing
The tyres on your mother's car

Not so good at hangin' the
Lights on the christmas tree
But darlin' if you're in the mood
You can call on me
Cos' you know just what I am
I'm your handy man

Well, I've never laid cement
And barely pruned a tree
And baby if you wanna call a pro
Well that's alright with me
If our kitchen sink, it spring a leak
Let's call the plumber out
But darlin' if you're feelin' weak
I'll hold you where it counts
Cos' you know just what I am
I'm your handy man
