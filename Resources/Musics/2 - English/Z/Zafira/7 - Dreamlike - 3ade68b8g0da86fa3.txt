DREAMLIKE

Dreamlike
Dreamlike 

Faded dreams are far away 
Faded dreams are far … 

Faded sun, dreamlike visions 
Faded dream 
Before a grey sun a delusion for us 

“not seeing anymore 
Should I be in thy deepest ocean forever 
I cannot feel my own soul 
It`s like waiting for nothing 
Staring at the distance 
It`s like letting me die 
…but it doesn`t matter anymore” 

In dreams a sort of peace I find 
Searching for some relief 
Drifting by just only…just a vision 
A few passing waves of faith 

Will all these far-off dreams come true? 
I wilt…will you come true? 
Make this consuming decease turn to joy! 
Oh shall you, my sweetest untouched angel, come back? 

Freezing in a lie, overwhelmed am I 
Breathing in a lie, to lay down and pass away 
Freezing in a lie, like a pounding spring sun 
Frustrated by a lie, to be fast asleep again 

Dreamed landscape of an olden age 
I`ve seen 
Unfolding …just to feel 
Despite of nothing lasts in time 
I await to your longing rise 
I die…
