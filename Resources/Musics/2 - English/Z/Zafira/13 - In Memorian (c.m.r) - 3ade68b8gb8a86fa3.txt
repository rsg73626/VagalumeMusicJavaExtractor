IN MEMORIAN (C.M.R)

In Memorian (C.M.R)
A tired heaven dying 
its clouds fall staining beautiful 
the shade sets in her garden 
winter gardens around me 
without pityâ€¦ 
winter, desolation, silent of dead 
waters are flowing, a flood 
and joyful was devoured 
today heaven is your absence 
that farewell to persist 
and our recalls are clinging on me 
with an oblivion 
you went away 
for aye
