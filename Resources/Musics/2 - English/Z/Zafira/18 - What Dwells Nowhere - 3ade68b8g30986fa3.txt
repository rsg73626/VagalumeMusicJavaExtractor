WHAT DWELLS NOWHERE

What dwells nowhere 

Fear in the arms of tonight, this night 
Failure for the one that has blind eyes 
And anyone is calling you, stay 
To be standout, entangled in this 
Hate comes out, mistakes me 
Feel this faceless time go by 

Sickness undefined 
And every losing man plays against life 
For only you`re life sight 
Revealing !!! 

These fucking dreams mean something! 
Here I`m running away 
Real life is here again 
Losing !!! 

I`m getting to corners of life 
Fucking day after day it kills me inside 

And anyone is calling you, stay 
To be standout, entangled in this 
Rage wraps, mistakes me 
Feel this roaring I canÂ´t hear 

Sickness undefined 
I`m in stone to conquer and fall 
In her soul all is total change 
A poisonous flow in dying hands 

Contemplate your corrosive hope 
The ever losing men frustrated
