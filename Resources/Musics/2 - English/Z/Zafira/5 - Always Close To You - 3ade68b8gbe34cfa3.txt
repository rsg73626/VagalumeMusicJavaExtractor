ALWAYS CLOSE TO YOU

Days of woebegone suffer
your wings…embraced me
and fled you I can’t forget you
oh love I need you so much
my heart often weeps
begging to be found
always close to you, close together
one we are and you know
for aye entwined
waving grass whispers a song
in god’s hands she ascends
around her coffin I wake
I pine away
