ALONE WITHIN MYSELF

Alone within myself 

Myself mislaid I`m set aside 
No signs of life but dreaming 
Uneven I feel (I don´t know) who you are 
Dejected in the deepest flame 
I still see no exit 
Forever lost you`ve taken all away 

Foreboding of death seeks me 
Closing I feel (I don´t know) who you are 
Dead am I, I take you on 
An unforgotten dream stolen 

In a lane lovers holding 
I`m the dwelling of my own mind 

God I plead for just one breath! 

First love a roaring it wakes 
Goodbye blows before to sleep 
Eyestrain, I`ve been here so long 
I ask for help to the loveless save me!!! 

Lonesome within myself unshaken set aside 
I still see no way 
The roaring I hear (now I know) who you are 
As the older I get the weaker I become 
I`m just myself and I come back 

First love a roaring it wakes 
Goodbye blows before to dream
