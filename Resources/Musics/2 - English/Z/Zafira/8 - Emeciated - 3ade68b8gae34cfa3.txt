EMECIATED

Came thee, flew thee
you gladded and confused me
you have turned happiness into grief
love into condemn
an emaciated face you are dead
you fled to the heaven’s confines
in love, for aye unreal
ran thee and you are hidden, ghostly
and I still stay immersed in your history
in an azure without glory
oh you and I are so tired
she’s in throe but I still love her
