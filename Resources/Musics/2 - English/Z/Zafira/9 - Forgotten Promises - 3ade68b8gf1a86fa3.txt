FORGOTTEN PROMISES

Forgotten promises 

Your cold hands turning pale 
All promised has been uprooted 
By the relentless 
The felt does vanish away 
Is it you the flame I looked for? 
The binding of lives 
I see in your wandering eyes 
Countless dreams 
You don`t see in my wandering eyes 
We forget mutuality (why aren`t you?) 
I wished we had stayed 
Now I forget myself all has changed 
But it seems the same 

I couldn`t face again in this life 
I want you now 
(I want you now and foraye) 
You forgot to dream and feel 
(And feel for us, for you and me) 
So did I 

Secrets buried dreams died 
Hearts did tremble 
Lying dispersed near 
We both resignedly wept afar 

(You forgot to dream, so did I) 

Lying dispersed near 
Secrets buried dreams died 
We both resignedly wept afar
