A FADING FAINT

A fading faint 

Soon I will dive into nothing I need to forget away 
Dimmed mask I begin to see me 
Touched by the cold disappearing day 

Unreal lost kills me 
Breaking the circle that my mind creates 

Up high in the skyâ€¦a farewell 
I can`t see me but I`m still breathing 
Blowing in the light undone 

Here inside all floating away 
Closer the conciseness 
I await at the door of the unknown 
Dying consuming all forsaken 
Timeless all vision unbroken 
All the passion drowned by indifference 

Insane, insane, insane 

By the circle of this floating air we are 
A stone`grave to this faith 
For this dream crashes into me 
Drawing the untold future 

Your fucking eyes stare at me 

After all the reason our life will be gone 
All is you forbidden, a failure in a fading calm 
For scratching words written of lost tragedies 
After all the reason our love will be over 
Driven, tortured, astray on this land 
Into the recognized forever unseen 

Days of light that tear us apart 
I will keep finding a burning sun 

Staring into the way of leaving 
Crimson crashes into me
