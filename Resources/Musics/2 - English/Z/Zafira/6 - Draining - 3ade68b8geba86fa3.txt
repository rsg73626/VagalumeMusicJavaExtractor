DRAINING

Draining
Draining 

Searching light stayed I will be 
Seconds hurt in the shade of leaves 
By this silhouette I`m still waiting 
While your sickness consuming me 
Could I feel thy trembling fever 
From your mountain of faith 

Unreal faint, a spring-like passion comes to an end 
God of leaving save this tragedy! 
Midnight crowns a weak crusade 

To be in disgrace 
Into scarlet corrosive wrath 
Losing faith at the edge of far-reaching 
Nothing carved in your body 
Will tell who you are 

Violent in your violet 
Colors of rainbow dwell nowhere 
I`m still so cold angels voices cry out alone 
I`m not sunrise mind`s oblivion burns 

Clarity, black consuming me 
Into the cave`s darkness 
Aura is falling I`m a river draining 

Myths sprawled I`m a thunder uncontrolled 
Gods unknown floating and vanishing 
Astral dust slowly collapsing 

Gone, a sun blinded and drown 
Undone, a stupid thought corrodes
