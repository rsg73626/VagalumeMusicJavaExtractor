ALL RAMBLING

All Rambling
All rambling 

All rambling as I be 
Now I`m my own enemy 
A false promise came back 
Turns out to be a lie I keep coming down 
I`m losing control as ever 
While you`re laughing and saying bye 

Here you`re closing the door day by day 
At the radio I hear your beating 
I see stupid world on T.V. 
They`re trying to get me missed 
As spinning stars make me remind your name 

This even voice quiet steps of void 
To the farthest dreamscape 
No angel will stop the real storm to come 
I ever wanted to get lost in your bed 
Ever rambling till to find some escape 

For selfish closing in falling hearts of ache 
Out there rainboy starves brightness fades 
Untouched land by the fountain of joy 

God walking away from me 
Everlasting sin condemned me 
Frozen mother and son wave a goodbye 
Free at last 

Like you were not a human being you`re laughing 
As I cry out please 
Souls entwine all rambling 
Sun`s fire died I`m not a visionary 
“The burden of grief doesn`t relent” 
Feel it
