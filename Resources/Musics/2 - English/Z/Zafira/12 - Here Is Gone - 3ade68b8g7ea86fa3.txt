HERE IS GONE

Here is gone 

Your pride will not resist a change 
Grey iris 
The sweetest lovers night goes by 
Over the unseen stream I run 

You`re calling me so far in 
You`re haunting me a scattered victory 
A sound that descends shattered by your breath 
My shade lies dead frozen time 
In intervals of time I weather for a while 
Caged in a stone 

Tormented stillness you`re holding me 
It`s too late for understanding 

Rain child far gone scars of age 
Angel is whispering singing songs 
Not for meâ€¦
