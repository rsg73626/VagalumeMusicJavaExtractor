28

Twenty-eight is not the age 
When the game is over. 
I'm feeling good; I'm at the stage 
When I'm here with you. 

Time is creeping through my eyes 
Day by day to nowhere. 
All that time I left behind 
Will never come, never... 

Twenty-eight is not the age 
When I left the party. 
Twenty-eight is not the age 
Of creeping death anxiety. 

Time is flowing through my eyes 
Day by day to nowhere. 
All that time I left behind 
Will never come, never, 
'Cause It's gone forever... 

Twenty-eight - 
The game is not over! 
Twenty-eight - 
The game is not over! 
The times flow. 
I feel the times flow now... 

Twenty-eight sides of my cage. 
How many will come? 
Twenty-eight times turning page 
With the runes of my life. 

Time is running through my eyes 
Day by day to nowhere. 
All this time is only mine 
Till I'm gone forever 
Through the gates to nowhere... 

Twenty-eight - 
The game is not over! 
Twenty-eight - 
The game is not over! 
The times flow. 
I feel the times flow now... 

Twenty-eight is not the age...
