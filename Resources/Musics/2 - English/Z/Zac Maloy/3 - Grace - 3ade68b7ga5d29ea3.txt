GRACE

When you were young
You thought that maybe you could be the north star
You didn't know better
By age 14 they had your feet firmly planted on the ground
Some day you'll find out
What it is
That you wanted to be
Someday you'll find
What it is
That you wanted to be
All the things you were supposed to be will lead the way to what you are
When do you feel the most alone you've ever felt
Only filling empty space
There's something still I see in you
Sure to me you radiate
Still to me the truest form of grace
