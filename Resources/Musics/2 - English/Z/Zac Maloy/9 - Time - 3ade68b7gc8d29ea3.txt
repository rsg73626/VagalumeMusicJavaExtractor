TIME

I don't want to be the one to tell you
You're bringing us down
Negative energy you keep bringing me
It's getting around
You keep hashing out the same old story 
Again and again
Caught between what I want and what I should be
A shrink or a friend
It's got to end
Why is it when I'm up you're always down
It seems to me you're fine when I'm not around
Time isn't something that your money buys
Time should be spend and not saved (all right)
Would you feel much better if I were on your level
Life is too short for us to do things
We don't want to do
If you're not happy with the life you're living
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you
