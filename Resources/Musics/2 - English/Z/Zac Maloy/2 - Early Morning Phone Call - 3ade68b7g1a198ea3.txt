EARLY MORNING PHONE CALL

It was an early morning phone call December
That got my attention
They called to tell me that you were gone
You were the strength of all my hopes and inspirations
You were the music in my song

Sometimes what doesn't seem so fair
That's what makes us more aware

I know you're smiling
I know you're singing, I know that you're in a better place
Where angels wings caress you
But I still miss you

More than leaves are falling this October
It's just that I wanted to stand with you for awhile
Now I"m walking throught a doorway to tomorrow
More like running, running out of time

Sometimes what doesn't seem so fair
That's what makes us more aware

I know you're smiling
I know you're singing, I know that you're in a better place
Where angels wings caress you
But I still miss you
