LIFE

Rolling in and out of love
You're spilling ink on the pure white dove
You had a dream for how it'd be and it was not this
Slowly turn and look behind, your water never turned to wine
The third pitch came across the plate and you missed
Breathing in and breathing out
He came into this world about, 30 hours after you began
You had him for 15 years
But you blame his actions on his peers
ANd the songs of a rock and roll band

And I said, yeah this is your life...
Yeah, this is your life.

You turned and went down the wrong damn road
But you went on just to see where you'd go
The dancing lessons getting complicated
You tried to win but you tried too hard
Tried to run but you went too far
You'd gotten further if you'd sat and waited

And I said, yeah this is your life
You only go around once, so get it right
Yeah, this is your life

Here's to the moon, here's to the lasso
I'm not saying it's wonderful cuz I just don't know
Rolling in and out of love, you're spilling ink on the pure white dove
You had a dream for how it'd be and it was not this

And I said, yeah this is your life
You only go around once, so get it right
Yeah, this is your life
