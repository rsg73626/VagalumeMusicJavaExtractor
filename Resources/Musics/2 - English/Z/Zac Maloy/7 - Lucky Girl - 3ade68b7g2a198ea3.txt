LUCKY GIRL

I know what they don't know and all the things you hide
I see what you don't see behind your eyes
There's more to the picture than you'll ever see yourself
All you have to do is try

Hey, you're a lucky girl
Hey, you're a lucky girl
A lucky girl

You're dreaming of a life you think you'll never have
But it's yours for the taking anytime
And I'm here when you need a friend to remind you
I'm right beside you all the way

Hey, you're a lucky girl
Hey, such a lucky girl
Hey, you're a lucky girl
A lucky girl
Lucky girl

Why do you hide the light inside you?
Why can't you see, you're beautiful?
I can't believe that you don't know
You're a lucky girl..
yeah.
You're a lucky girl

Yeah,
Hey, you're a lucky girl
Hey, such a lucky girl
Hey, you're a lucky girl
A lucky girl
Lucky girl
