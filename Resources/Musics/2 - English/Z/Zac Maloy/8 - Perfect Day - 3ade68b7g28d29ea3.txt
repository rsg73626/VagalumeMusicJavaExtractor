PERFECT DAY

On a Sunday morning, far enough away, to understand
Why they say things never last
I hardly can remember, which way the road is going
i'll count a hundred cars before an hour's past
And I thank you, for the real life
Though my words usually stay inside

I'll pick you up, when you're down
And I'll be the sun shining down
Any day with you is a perfect day

Another song is wading, thorught the radio
Every word reminds me why I had to go
I hardly can remember what I had there
In a second, I know that I will know
Cuz your touch is like magic
It's more than I could imagine
In your arms I drift away

I'll pick you up, when you're down
And I'll be the sun shining down
Any day with you is a perfect day
