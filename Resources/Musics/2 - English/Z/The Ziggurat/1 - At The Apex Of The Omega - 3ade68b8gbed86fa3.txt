AT THE APEX OF THE OMEGA

At the Apex of the Omega
Beyond the seething Absu 
Lies the plain that contains the gate of Cthulhu 
And in the realm of the dying sun where no life dwells 
The incantations of the blackened souls will make HIM rise 

Rise...rise from the chains that bind you 
Rise...rise from your darkened slumber...oh ancient one 

Dingir Xul Kanpa 

And as he wakes from his dream 
Infinite voices from the abyss begin to scream 
Lord...we awaken thee 
Rise from your darkened slumber ancient one! 

Ia Ia Cthulhu Fhtagn.........
