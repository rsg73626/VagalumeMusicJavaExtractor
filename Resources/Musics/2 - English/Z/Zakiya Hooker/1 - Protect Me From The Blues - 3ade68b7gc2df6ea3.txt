PROTECT ME FROM THE BLUES

How many times have I asked myself why
All the good things in life seem to pass me by
Trouble and pain is my claim to fame
No matter what I do, I can't find a love that's true
Gave you all I had, then I gave you even more
But all you ever did, was make me blue

Where were you, when I needed you, oh oh baby
Where were you, to protect me from the blues?

My days grow long without him
I don't think my lonely heart will ever mend
Go through my days feelin' tired and blue
All I have left are memories of you
There's danger in this heart of mine
I think I see a real real bad time

Where were you, when I needed you, oh oh baby
Where were you, to protect me from the blues?

I gave you all I had, then I gave you even more
But all you ever did boy, was make me blue

Where were you, when I needed you, oh baby
Where were you, to protect me from the blues?

Ah baby, ah save me from the blues
Ah baby help me, ah protect me from the blues
