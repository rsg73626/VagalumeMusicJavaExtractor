TWO LONESOME HEARTS

Betty wiped tables since she was a girl
From longview to lubbock that was her world
Jimmy herded cattle on his buckskin horse
Since he was thirteen that was his only course

Chorus
They were two lonesome hearts, riding on the wind
Blowing like tumbleweeds, hurting like sin
Two lonesome hearts, that's a big space to fill
Wishin' they would, wonderin' if they will

He never dropped roots, and neither had she
That ol' texas highway was as far as they could see
When you live that way love don't last long
One day you got it, the next day you're gone

(chorus)

Jimmy met betty at a roadside bar
They talked for hours out in betty's car
So much to say but so little said
Then the wind picked up and blew 'em their separate ways

Out on the highway, in between towns
It's easy to run with your wheels spinnin' 'round
But inside the heart, there's no guarantee
That if you break loose you will ever be free

They were two lonesome hearts, riding on the wind
Blowing like tumbleweeds, hurting like sin
Two lonesome hearts, that's a big space to fill
Wishin' they would, knowin' they never will

Two lonesome hearts
Two lonesome hearts
