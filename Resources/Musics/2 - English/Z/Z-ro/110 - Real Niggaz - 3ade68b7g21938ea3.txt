REAL NIGGAZ

(*talking*) 
2000, Z-Ro, Z-Ro the motherfucking Don 
Y'all know me, talking about this shife ass life that we live 
Brothers killing brothers, sisters killing sisters 
Fathers killing sons, god damn 

[Z-Ro] 
Let me continue by saying, that I don't love these hoes 
My only love is found Ro, dumping optimoes 
In an attempt to get lifted, trying to separate the real from the wicked 
Be grown ain't as easy, as we thought it was is it 
Nigga but you can visit me in prison, or keep in touch by the letters 
Just seeing my partnas face, will make me feel better 
Cause this earth is cursed, so I'm identified by pain in my verse 
And will the final face I see be a nurse, for what its worth 
I wanna die while I'm sleeping, not while I'm creeping 
Because my closest homies, might be into grim reaping 
Hard for me to believe, that I became the man I am 
Went from bible study to moving grams, on a digital scale 
I make mail, cause in yale I sell 
Guaranteed to make a profit, never fail 
Cause they run and tell more money for me, cause I wanna be able 
Not to ball, but to keep food on the able, believe that 

[Chorus] 
Real niggas keep it real with God, keep your head up 
Stay down on your knees, cause this life is hard 
I know you don't wanna live in jail, for living shife 
Hoping you might receive a kite, from your child and your wife 
Real niggas keep it real with God, keep your head up 
Stay down on your knees, cause this life is hard 
I know you don't wanna live in hell, for living shife 
Or in the house of the Lord, all the days of your life 

[Z-Ro] 
Remember me and T, I still got love 
But somebody been looking for me, so that's the reason I got slugs 
Loaded up in a twelve gauge, holding it close when I walk around corners 
Trying to stay sober, to be on my P's and Q's so no marijuana 
But if its destiny for me to fail, I'd rather 
Kick it in Heaven, and leave the jealous in this hell 
I'm built to last so I'm gon blast, with intentions to kill 
Because we living under the devil, for real 
God don't love the world, Eddie Davis only son to save him 
If it was me, I would of told my father pop I can't fade it 
Because the world is so hateful (hateful) 
Scandalous, conniving and ungrateful (ungrateful) 
And if it ain't a nigga from the streets, then look to your family 
Cause they gon tip with you, wait for you to get paid and try to sip with you 
But y'all ain't drinking up out my cup, cause that will leave a poisonous 
stain 
Its hard enough to keep my pistol from my brain, maintain 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
Rest in peace Grand Pappy Mafioso, day before yesterday 
Another statistic, cause somebody let the AK spray 
You know its hard for me to deal with, but I know what 
I gotta do, get something to make them hatas blood spill with 
Kill me if you can, then you's the better man 
But I'm telling you right now, I'm a motherfucking veteran 
Gotta spill them niggas be talking about, I'm about to pick this nigga 
Gotta watch these hoes, because they skinless ass dickless niggas 
And I don't wanna die, so if I have too I'ma blast on sight 
Better take cover, because I'm coming for your ass tonight 
And even still I try to keep my composure 
But I find myself, drowning in codeine and the doja 
I'll forever be thugging and mean mugging, while I'm clutching a fat nine 
Eager to make a motherfucker, flat line 
But I never start nothing with niggas, I just end it with a bang 
When you do dirt, you get dirt mayn 

[Chorus]
