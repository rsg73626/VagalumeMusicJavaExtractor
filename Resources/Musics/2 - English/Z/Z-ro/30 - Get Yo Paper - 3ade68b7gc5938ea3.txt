GET YO PAPER

[Z-Ro] 
You got to get your paper in this game 
If you a hustler (if you a hustler) 
Niggas be playing with this thang, but you all about your change 
They can't touch us (they can't touch us) 
24/7 all day, and in business 
But on the low, 5-0 ain't gon witness it 
I'm in the alley with them quarters and halfs up in my hand 
Thinking of a master plan, I can 
Hustle all night, to the early morn', I can 
Flip and serving rappers, serve his dome 
And if a nigga plotting on me, I disturb his home 
And then straight up fore' they even, as I swerve his dome 

[Chorus] 
Get your paper hustling up in these city streets 
Don't forget to spending 10 thousand dollas on c.d.s 
And if you rapping ain't no handouts in this industry 
Whatever you can take your time 
Get your paper hustling up in these city streets 
Don't forget to spending 10 thousand dollas on c.d.s 
And if you rapping ain't no handouts in this industry 
Don't let it take over your mind 

[Z-Ro] 
I use to set up shop bout six o'clock 
In the morning on my grind 
Powder packs and crack and nerve sacks 
Out of the ghetto was on my mind 
Needed to relocate with the thought of location, keeping it on the low 
Cause when niggas beep you all the time 
It seems they act friends, just to get your dough 
But it ain't no raw to me 
I ride with the armory, the AR 1-5 
Collecting my digits and spinning my tires 
No time for conversation, I gotta ride 
Back to my safe place, stash spot for the waste plate 
Cause I'm a go getter, if the game escapes 
Balling was the picture, cause there was no hitter 
Niggas is sinning major 
Nothing but home runs when I swing my bat 
But some of these niggas be playing crooked 
So I can't forget to bring my gat 
And when it's all said and done 
I'ma redo my walls with platinum placks 
At the Source Awards, with a granddaddy 
Couple of drinks, straight like that 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
I'ma get my paper, hustling up in this rap game 
I'm moving my units, I'm moving my heart it's all for stacks man 
And once I get it, it ain't gon be no turning back 
Fuck the boomerang affect, making motherfuckers hate me 
From a distance, hopping fences in an instant 
Trying to get away from the long arm of the law 
Jepordize my benjamins, I will be forced to put some harm on your jaw 
My attitude be raising it's amazing, I'm not locked for man slaughter 
Because I love my plastic princess, and I can't keep my hands off her 
She be right next to my nuts, everytime I deal with hoes and crews 
Send my bitch to fucking suck it bitch, before I know they move 
Is that gangster enough for you baby, Ro gotta get his dough bro 
Bending corners, in a tinted out four do' Volvo, blowing dro hoe 

[Chorus - 2x]
