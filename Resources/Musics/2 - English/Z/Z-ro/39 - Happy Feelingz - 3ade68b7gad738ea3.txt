HAPPY FEELINGZ

Lately, my luck has taken a turn for the worse I used to 
ride in luxury now i'm headed for a hearse and if it deals 
that way, my day-to-days are full of sufferin' my headaches 
they be relieved by asprin or bufferin and my children got 
mo problems that you can't solve but everytime i try to 
rise all I do is sing slow like the water in the Pacific 
got my vessel capsized seems like I been going through it 
since I got Baptized (It's the Jesus I can feel him all up 
in my bones..) cuz' he be givin me game on how to live my 
life long can't forget about the Angels at the psychiatric 
center, helpin' me to feel like i'm a winner..got me takin 
Lexapron, just so I can improve my movin' got me feelin' 
like I'm giant though obsticles steadily movin' fuckin' 
flatening the process of me reachin' to the top, ya'll know 
that i'm the cream of da crop and i'ma have people 
sayin'...... 


(Chorus x2) 

(chorus) 
Get yo' ass up out my Satan 
I got a mansion, robe, and a Crown waitin, never again will you catch me livin in sin, cuz when the pearly gates open I wanna be steppin in
