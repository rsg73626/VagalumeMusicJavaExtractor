SAME ONE

Woke up wit 50 some odd niggaz bumpin they gums 
God I tried to be calm 
But everywhere I go its like Veitnam 
I tried to be Joseph McVay 
But niggaz be bringing the killa back out in me everyday 
The same niggaz,I broke bread wit and got feed wit me 
Stood behind the trigga when the infared led hit me 
In my cunfusion ain't no such thang as a friend 
All I know,homocides are homies plotting trying to sniff out my endz 
Like they a blood hound or a cuz hound 
Fuck few dollars,them or they blood or cuz down 
It'll be the same niggaz you be rollin wit and fucking wit hoes 
That'll tell yo woman you unfaithful 
Cuz you fucking wit hoes 
Same nigga sit down to piss 
Unable to stand up straight 
They the reason real niggaz doing time upstate 
Talkiing to 222 clips cuz they hustle is dead 
The block is too hot fo em 
So they snitchin to get they bread 

Chorus: 
It be the same one screaming that he down 4 life that'll come and lay you down tonight 
Same nigga 
I retaliated 4 wit 45's and K's 
One that got me doing time today 
No lie 
Same nigga I done fed when they low on his bread 
Same nigga trying to get between my lil mama legs 
It be the same one you figure the closest to ya 
That'll treat you like he never even knew ya
