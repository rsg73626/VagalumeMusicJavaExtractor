ANOTHER SONG

[Talking] 
Hold up let me hit my Hypnotic 
aight you rollin? 
I'd just like to take a minute to apolgize to my listeners 
I just wanna say I'm sorry for not havin any songs about happiness 
or bein in peace and shit like that 
see I can only display my personal feelings and experinces 
and so far I ain't felt what happiness feels like 
and experinced anything but hard times and heartache 
so I apoligize for not makin you dance 
I apologize for not havin any sarcastical songs 
you know that good feeling with e'm 
that put a smile on your face 
I ain't had nothin to offer accept for frown 
so for that I'm sorry I promise if I can sing another song 

([Verse 1] 
I wish I could tell you my life was good but it's not 
I wish misery, city runners were cold, but they're hot 
so many situations to deal with, I can't concentrate 
a hundred homies and everyone is fake 
how can I make it out the ghetto it want let me go 
seems like everytime I do a good deed, good deeds never return to 'Ro 
I gave up my last so somebody could have a start 
then somebody got me locked behind bars 
what a way to show ya love back-homie you a friend for life 
for your crime I'm doin time in the Penn tonight 
it's bad enough I lost a family my luck ain't live 
mama died when I was 6 and Daddy ain't have enough time 
to kick it with me-like I wanted him to kick it with me 
now that I'm incarcarated you wanna come and visit with me 
but I ain't holdin no grudges Daddy I love you that's my word 
even though you had me sleeping on a curb...I wish I had another song 

[Chorus] 
These are the days(these are the days) 
we cherish them because soon they'll be gone away(soon they'll be gone away) 
on to another place 
pretty soon I'll be gone 
twenty-summod years of calling God on this mobile phone 
if it wasn't for my life style I'd sing another song 

[Verse 2] 
I wish that I was ridin around in a Bentley 
but maybe Z-Ro living lavish just ain't meant to be 
cause I'm the type of fella that'll give a bum a hundred dollars 
I'd rather help out my people instead of poppin my collar 
I wish that I could get a million copies sold 
if I'm broke I'd rather die I don't want no more poverty-'Ro and oh 
sometimes I wish that I was somebody else 
cause I can't even pay bills even though my CD's want stay on the shelf 
strugglin and I'm strivin and just barely strivin 
bobbin and weavin-my last breathe time after time 
and it seems that I want ever get no rest I'm exhausted 
tryna make it-compare the price and pain is what the cost is 
maybe if I was evil I'd be rolling in bread 
until somebody with a pistol come and opened my head 
but my mission is keepin ambition 
I'm trying so hard even though my soul is scarred-oh Lord... 
I wish I had another song 

[Chorus] 
These are the days(these are the days) 
we cherish them because soon they'll be gone away(soon they'll be gone away) 
on to another place 
pretty soon I'll be gone 
twenty-summod years of calling God on this mobile phone 
if it wasn't for my life style I'd sing another song 

[Verse 3-singing] 
I wish that I could sing another song 
but my rhythm is too much pain 
sunshine is the level that I think I'm own so tell me why it's so much rain 
day to day it's a struggle in my lifetime 
to keep from creepin I be stayin in the G 
no crimes commited so tell me why I'm doin time 
and want nobody come and sit with me for free 
sometimes at night I smoke a cig and sit back 
and wonder why the whole world hate me 
so much ambition I just gotta pull my wig back 
wishing murder would come on and take me 
I wish that I could sing another song 
I'm tired of sleeping in rivers of tears all night long 
no point in wonderin why my people use to do me wrong 
stuck in this reality until my life is over and gone 

[Chorus] 
These are the days(these are the days) 
we cherish them because soon they'll be gone away(soon they'll be gone away) 
on to another place 
pretty soon I'll be gone 
twenty-summod years of calling God on this mobile phone 
if it wasn't for my life style I'd sing another song
