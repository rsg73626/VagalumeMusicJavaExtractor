EVERYDAY

[Verse 1: Z-Ro] 
My nigga Redd been assisting me with holdin my head 
but I can't focuse cause so many niggaz in the street owe me some bread 
and if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed? 
if all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby 
my forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht 
might take alittle time for me to see bigger living (??) or not 
but I want stop until I'm touchin my figures, you better move(bitch) 
cause I be bustin my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through 
been so broke and embarrased couldn't afford a tooth brush fool 
if it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O 
offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low 
runnin up and down Houston slangin dimes and nickles 
performing for my hood niggaz spittin rhymes and riddles 
forever stayin on our grind because of the shine it give us 
and fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us 

[Chorus: Trae - repeat 2X] 
Everyday it's like I can't maintain 
but still I feel I'm in it for the same thing 
all I ever wanted is just to get my change 
living strength is my only type of mind frame 

[Verse 2: Z-Ro] 
It's in my blood, it's in my body, it's in my soul 
gettin' paper been so important since I've been on my own 
don't nobody love me in this cold world 
fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl 
is a motherfucker I ain't tryna hear it, I ain't tryna know ya 
unless you be a hustler tryna come up on some mo' bucks 
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun 
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond 
fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march 
cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin on this cross 
witness the J.Prince runnin the south 
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide recievers cause we all be runnin our route 
I'm goin long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong 
cause it be crucializing everything that be goin on try to maintain 
cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne 
win it just to stay in the game (mayne) 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Z-Ro] 
Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness 
kickin it with the jealous got me beggin for forgiveness 
this record label presidental think they live like me 
think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me 
they living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name 
but they can't sell records without me that's a godamn shame 
hoe nigga get ya roll up, everytime I flex you cats in check 
cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch! 
everytime I speak bitch niggaz steadily be plottin 
on removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin prison 
but it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out 
but me you've seen I'm havin things in my dreams I can't get it out 
God blessed the child that can double his fetti 
duckin and dodgin trouble cops and trouble times come get me 
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone 
and live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home 

[Chorus] - repeat to end
