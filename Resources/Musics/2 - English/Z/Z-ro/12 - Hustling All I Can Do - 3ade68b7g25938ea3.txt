HUSTLING ALL I CAN DO

[Mr. 3-2] 
May life be a trip, I never knew, things could ever get bad 
As I got no love my 17 shot glock with extra clips 
That's it, I'm going all out and if I die then remember me 
Cause in these last days I'm feeling like I'ma hit the penitentiary 
For real, trying to deal with this every day struggle 
You got to get up, up off your rump baby and hustle 
I tussle, work my muscle, and boss hog 
Take what's mine, and still screaming fuck y'all 
If I can't ball, they better lock me up 
Shackled down, hand cuffed, on sight I'ma bust 
What's up, where your nuts, I get rushed to the head 
Thug for life, motherfucker till I'm dead 
Mr. 3-2, boss of all bosses 
And I ain't, tolerating no losses 
And no excuses, cause this world is so shife 
Street game forever, and it's like that for life, nigga 

(Chorus) 
Will I ever see the stage again 
Radio D.J.s gone respect my rhythm 
Feeling like I'm fin to hit the pen again 
What will I do for food 
Living in the ghetto turning boys to men 
Crooked cops and killers interrupt my mission 
Tell me will I ever pimp my penn again 
Hustling is all I can do 

[Verse 2] 
I was born on a fucked up day, had to be, holidays 
With nothing but frowns on my face, the sadness brought madness 
To a family that was built, unconsciencely I love em 
But some consciencely, running these streets, living constantly 
It's costing me, way too much, but the slums got me 
Jacking niggas work something, exclude before I hurt something 
Inhale, exhale, ok, I promise things 
Gone get better, just give me one more day 
So I can work my jealous friends to have around 
So I can tote my shit and hurt my belly for trying to stay down 
Stay focused on what I'm trying to accomplish, and not be accomplice 
Stay real, stay true, pay dues, and don't become a victim of some mob shit 
I never let this misery, push me to do something I regret 
But just notice you in danger, I want you to feel my anger 
And if I ever feel like I'm danger, I'ma empty the chamber, oh-oh 

(Chorus) 

[Z-Ro] 
These motherfuckers want me dead, at least that's how it seems to be 
An army of motherfuckers against me Dean and E 
Who you gone call, when my commratery come down rain 
Nothing but revenge to keep me sane, it ain't nothing like pain 
Cause when I squeeze it then you bleed, satisfaction is guaranteed 
Black hearted ever since the first murder, off precious is my breed 
Enemies, fuck all my foes, fuck all my friends 
Unless I'm in the penn, I've got nobody to call my kin 
Cause all the real niggas are dead or in jail, but I've been 
Left in struggle for success trying to get a check from Southwest Wholesale 
Look at all the 16's that I've wrecked, and I'm practically poor 
On top of that I'm homeless my niggas don't want me no more 
Fuck being ten to get in, these motherfuckers act like they don't know my face 
Better remember I'm quick to click and hit don't act like you don't know my pace 
Well fuck rapping, I need some right now money, it's getting crucial 
If I pimp my pen, I got to wait 3 months for trade me scratch for lunch money 
Monday night the sirens seemed so loud 
I hope that I can lose this crowd 
Lately, it go down that way 
That's why a nigga quick to get the K and spray 
We could of been so throwed together 
But because I was short it's on my cheddar 
I haaaad to get up and bleed the block, and it don't stop 

(Chorus)
