THE MULE

[Z-Ro] 
What? 
King of the Ghetto what they call me cause I rule this Bitch (rule this Bitch) 
I'm bout business I don't participate in foolishness (foolishness) 
But every now and then somebody want to get the trippin with me (trippin with me) 
And thats when I get stupid and them gorilla niggaz be with me 
But I'll rather be running up in something wet and slippery (wet and slipperrrry) 
Waiting on a nigga baby mama to come visit me (visit meeee) 
They know I'm working with something so they be trying to holla (trying to holla) 
They nigga just make them moan they hit me when they trying to holla (trying to holla) 
Guess I be digging to deep they emotions start growing 
Got they husband wondering who they been fucking four in the morning (four in the morning) 
Lil mama cover you track if ya man find out and call his self 
trying to check me I'm a beat his Bitch ass (Bitch ass) 
He just mad cause he be missing and needing his bitch ass (Bitch ass) 
And he mad cause I be rubbing and squeezing his bitch ass (Bitch ass) 
He in love with the chick and she don't even remember his ass 
She down for Z-Ro and do anything I ask 
Cause I hit her with the mule 

[Chorus 2X: Devin the Dude] + (Z-Ro) 
Thats the reason why these broads be tripping don't want me to be with no other women 
(Cause I hit 'em with the mule) 
Going to deep when I be diggin up in them bumping up against they kidneys 
when I stick them 
(Cause I hit 'em with the mule) 

[Devin the Dude] 
Valerie is mad at me because I ran up in Kim 
Kim got a nigga so Val told him 
How I be sneaking with his gal yeah massaging that monkey 
Slapping her on the ass while she riding that donkey 
And now my name in the mix 
But thats what you get putting your thang in a bitch 
You got to butt em' up stick 'em ha ha and dip 
Flush the rubber yep and get in the car and flip 
But hoes always know where your ride at 
Or at least where it was they notice the tire tracks now they flat 
So I learned to be polite move over please 
grind it up in them an damn near damage their ovaries 
Jack that ass up look at a minute 
Then urghhh ride up in it 
It's a certain way you stroke the hoes 
Take her on a vacation poke her nose 

[Chorus] 

[Juvenile] 
Look I can't help but see her she got that big ol' bumper behind her 
When I see her she remind me of my lil mama Mia 
I don't want rewind back to my bahama dear 
She was out chea this lil nigga got her here 
You wanna know bout my neighbor yeah I kinda knew her 
She was impress with my whips I wasn't kinda sure 
Kinda blew her off cause she was playing me tight 
Bumping down and let them whitey boys change her life 
I hope you ain't beefing 
And my past ain't got nothing to do with me hitting that ass 
Ma I'm tweaking, I'm from a different world 
Where you don't tie a woman down if she want to look around go head and get it girl 
Flexxa time to have sexxa 
Look how ya got me I don worked up a sweat 
Calling my number cause no one do it better 
Got you at home at night writing me letters 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
Pissed of cause too many people been in my face 
Mean mugging everybody two seconds from catching a case 
Plus somebody just hit my car man the shit don't stop 
Go thru my phone and choose a victim take it out on the cock (on the cock) 
Ma thinking bout gripping ass thats why I hit it swift and fast 
I'm a put this log on you you gon' feel it all in your calves 
A gangsta so I'm raw with it I know what I'm doing 
Thats why she pop up at my residence trying to see what I'm doing 
She knocking if the lights on ready to get her fight on 
Cause last night she had orgasms all night long 
Made her feel like she was married with children 
But ain't no Al and Peggy I'm strictly here to do some drilling in your man filling 
There would be my hand filling all up in your you know 
But you disappointed cause you ain't my numeral uno 
So you go acting a fool breaking all a players rule 
Straight forgot you had dude at home 
Cause I hit you with the mule 

[Chorus]
