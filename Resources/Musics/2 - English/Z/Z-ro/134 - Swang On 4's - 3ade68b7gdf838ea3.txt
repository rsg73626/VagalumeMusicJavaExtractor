SWANG ON 4'S

(Big Moe) 
Swingers, and droppers, Southside 
We're gonna ball baby, living so lavishly 
And you know that I'll, grab and break 
Wreckshopping all night long baby 
Swing on 4's with me 

[Verse 1] 
Swing 4's with me, come roll with me 
As the po-po, cause I'ma flow the tree 
Make tracks stop, beating up the block 
Ass end hop on the 4's and chop 
Can't let these haters take what I got 
Blue and frail, fresh out the shop 
Some gone bop, the lighters gone light 
That's why I keep glocks with infrared dots 
No time to plex, got to push the lex 
Keep them diamonds shining round my neck 
Shots of chrome while I'm on the phone 
Popping legs walking in my home 
Walking through the doors, on marble floors 
Chandeliers and studios 
Got to pimp the pen, when I'm in the wind 
And swanging 4's with optimos 

[Hook - 2x] 
Swang on 4's with me, and I like it 
Shoes finest on my rims cause I swing on 4's 
Swang on 4's with me, oooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Shoes finest on my rims cause I swing on 4's 

[Z-Ro] 
Oooooooh I'm one swinger, with wood grain 
All on my dash, when I pass I'm looking oh so clean 
Oooooone in the chaaamber they must be 
Out of their minds if they're trying to take my bitch from me 
I won't be taken, releasing shots from my gun 
Ain't the one to get took off my four 
Cause I know these jackers be waiting 
That's why I'm strapped at all times, I think you better let go 

[Hook - 2x] 

[Z-Ro] 
Bubble lights they shining bright, bull-guard in the turning lane 
I'ma rock candy coat, then I'ma play with a remote working with wood grain 
Z-Ro gone bleed the block not with the rocks, I bleed red like the flesh 
It ain't no more hoops, just candy Coupes rings filed in the STS 
Little young got a gun and beam, and I make you scream 
I work too hard when I grind, for niggas that wanna take my shit 
And niggas will get hit, I promise these fellas gone mind 
If I got to pull my piece to make a hater retreat 
Then I'ma focus on taking him out with red dots, they will smell 
It in the wind 'fore they try to move in I'm busting in the parking lot 
In a big body Dave & Taylor ain't no haunt day 
Going the wrong way on the one way, screams falling 
Like rain drops, they gonna try to take me one day 
But I'm armed and dangerous, eliminated the plex 
When it came to us unlike these muts 
I ain't no bust, riding on 94's and the game to us 
Realizing that there ain't no changing us, re-arranging us 
Homicide be naming us, drunk too many 4's now there ain't no waking up 
And ghetto hoes be paging us, and steady broads be claiming us 
But I'ma hit my switch, drop the top and unlock my kid 
From South coast to a million copies, we swinging bitch 

[Hook - 2x]
