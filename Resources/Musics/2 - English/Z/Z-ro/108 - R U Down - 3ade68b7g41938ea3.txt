R U DOWN

[Z-Ro] 
Stained all broke ass niggas in my mix, mix 

[Z-Ro] 
I heard a stranger say geurilla till I die but motherfuckers be claiming 
A name in vein nigga you ain't never witnessed the pain 
But I got a diploma for making bitch niggas hold they jaw 
When I pull a nine out, I'ma find out witch nigga told the law 
When my homie was located incarcerated and simming on one 
It's like going from heaven to slum, motherfucker now you know 
This is dedicated to you, dear bitch 
This is dedicated to the coward niggas of your click 
Then jamming out killing to go and get the motherfuckers 
but they fin to feel approach from behind 
For the mighty motherfuckin power ranger danger becuase of my anger 
Never been stranger to run in the chamber so run 
Or I'll be coming across the chamber with my gun 
No coming back, welcome to my world, I'll show you pain you never seen 
Or slapping patches out of niggas and we mean it when we scream it 
Never be given a good god damn so don't they go and get us started 
Now it's time to show these niggas we the hardest 
all I want to know is are you down 

[Chorus - 2x] 
How many niggas want to ride with me 
They say my mob is a threat to society 
Because we mobbing in masks 
Get the gauge and we blast 
And quick to put a motherfucker on his ass 
Are you down 

[Trae: Geurilla Maab] 
Now which one of you niggas is fake 
and tell me which one of you niggas are real 
I might now find out now 
but I guarantee if you cause me then I got your grill 
Cause I don't feel, a nigga should chill, with me still 
For me, smile in my face and stabbed me in my back seat 
Obviously, that nigga ain't down with me 
And he ain't who he claim to be, but it ain't no game to me 
I take it seriously, and keep my eyes on my motherfucking enemies 

[Geurilla Maab] 
Got to keep my distance g, cause i know they plotting on me 
To set me up for a homicide or robbery 
But it ain't no thang to me, cause I got my family 
Killa Klan and Geurilla Maab coming cotastraphy 
You get snatched if we, feel you less than a man 
I'm in a clan where niggas trained to kill with that by hand 
But they don't understand, untill they been there 
Are you down or what, cause if not than beware 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Z-Ro} 
Stained all broke ass niggas in my mix, mix 

[Z-Ro] 
Now most of the time I'm by myself cause all of my friends are fake 
How many more chins willI have to check 
untill the bones in my wrist and my fist finally break 
But I was born, as a child of the corn 
Now between heaven and hell I'm torn and trapped in a motherfucking storm 
I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die, my mind is constantly gone on fry 
You laughed when I bumped you off 
then I jumped you off thinking it's about time 
To close shop, get the nine glock, put a nigga in a pop box 
I need some gin, instead of rate 
the murder death kill of a nigga that really won't breath again 
But there ain't another nigga that's as cold as I 
And I'm gone hold on to my geurillas untill I'm told to die 
But motherfuckers be coming in sets when they be rolling by 
But motherfuckers are horizontal with a swollen eye 
I'ma keep me a lean on rubatussin, got to keep me a glock that I be busting 
I got to to keep my eyes open wider, motherfuckers be thinking they Mckeiver 
Pull a stunt got a trick up they sleeve 
hate me motherfuckers don't like breathing 
When a geurilla like me never be leaving 
I got a man with a verse that I be reading but are you down 

[Chorus - 4x]
