NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE

[Hook - 2x] 
They'll never take me alive, sleeping with one eye open 
I'm paranoid fuck sleep, and I'm drinking and I'm smoking 
Ain't no love in my heart, too many times it been broken 
So my lifestyle is fuck y'all niggas, and I ain't joking 

[Z-Ro] 
They'll never take me alive, I'ma be dumping till it's over 
A soldier, with a 50 caliber pistol in my holster 
Ready to brandish my weapon, on the bitch made 
Hoe ass niggas like Crooked Profit, get the switchblade 
I hope you bitches, and you hoes know 
That I don't love you, you can get a blow to your nose 
Just like a nigga catching cases, ain't shit to a nigga that do it daily 
Dropping salt on my enemies, till you bitches come and face me 
Let's get it cracking, what you waiting on 
Better pray to Jesus, cause my neighborhood is Satan zone 
Set tripping is what I do, wet niggas and bitches too 
Loc up on you riding, cause I'm violent all my roll dogs looking for you 
I handle my own beef, ain't gotta get nobody else to solve it 
Cause my 3-57, can just revolve it 
Or we can go with them hands, in the middle of the sand 
Going out on my own terms is my plan, I'm paranoid

These motherfuckers got me clicking, running out my mind 
M double A-B till I D-I-E, I ain't slowing down 
I've been a soldier from the jump, don't run up to get you stomped 
Or dump the side of my trunk, this reality ain't no punk 
So I clicked up with guerillas that was Maabing, drug dealing and robbing 
On the block shifer than vaulters, cause motherfuckers was starving 
My brother got caught in the midst, they hit him 3 with a L 
So the only thing that we got, is communicating through mail 
Fuck the judge and the district attorney, and I'ma catch him 
All the pain building up, is gon teach them bitches a lesson 
I ain't never did shit, and I ain't never had shit 
So don't you look like you confused, when I hop in my mask bitch 
Blast bitch, or become another victim of homicide 
You in danger if my anger, provoke a nigga to ride 
I'm wishing murder on every friend, that turned to be my foes 
I'm a asshole by nature forever, so fuck you hoes 

[Hook - 2x] 

[Trae] 
Ain't no escaping guerillas, when they coming in packs ready to attack 
With a black gat, only to leave your lifeline flat 
We don't know how to act, and you can blame it on the cops 
On the block late night, running with rocks and it don't stop 
Because we untamed, trying to escape the rain 
No matter how hard that we try, we just can't escape the pain 
Insane, is what I be going I'm never gon be the same 
Screaming all of you motherfuckers names, simple and plain 

[Z-Ro] 
DJ and DJ, wanna see how many hearts I rip 
But you be friendly in the presence, of a gangsta bitch 
When you talk down on my family, bro you fucking with mine 
So catch me one deep out the window, as I'm bucking my nine 
Ain't got no love for nothing, that got love for a nigga 
Cause in the end, they end up having slugs for a nigga 
So fuck a vest, if I'm destined to get one in my chest 
I guess I'ma hook up with Pac, and puff on some of heaven's best bitch
