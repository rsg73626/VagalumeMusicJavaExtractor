THE DIRTY 3RD

Shirt off at the Kappa, (trousers on) 
Dirty Third, Dirty Third 

[Z-Ro] 
24/7 and around the clock, I'ma keep 
My fingas around the glock, when I bust 
I be giving no mercy for no damn body 
That's gonna get around the shot 
I'm the 007 outta Ridgemont 4, with W double O-D 
Can't take no ill to the eye, we come so fly 
Don't get it twisted I swear I'm fly, I split up jaws 
When I spit out rounds, and I really don't give a damn 
When a nigga pull the trick up outta my sleeve 
I'm making a deuce to the pistol pad 
But I'm figgering that hoe, and she call me hurt 
Whatever take yourself, or the blood gon squirt 
Give me my money for shots or first 
When I lick my shots, I clear the concerts 
Jay-Jay and the Den-Den, we gon make a mill in the end then 
Going overseas, in the jabos and fresh benefits 
Decked out to Europe in outfits, steady stacking chips 
Slanging birds, with a pen and beat the shit out these verbs 
Vocabulary spit nothing but words 
Drop mo' songs, than a bird do terds 
Riding Excursions, no more 'Burbans, steal them niggas SUV 
Screwed Up Click cause my family name, abbreviated like S.U.C. 
Cause in the Dirty Third, niggas put prices up on our heads 
Cause our cars, be running and haunting 
Bitches lose weight, like Jenny Craig 

[Hook - 2x] 
Its the Dirty Third, slanging rings stacking chips 
Quick to pull a strap, empty clips if you trip 
Its the Dirty Third, slanging rings stacking chips 
We killas with pistol grip, steady letting our rugas rip 

[Wood] 
We ain't burning the home grown, and Dirty Third where I roam 
Slanging birds flipping zones, sipping syrup out our styrofoams 
Quick to pull a strap empty clips, if you trip 
We killas with pistol grip, steady letting our rugas rip 
At the peak of my game I'm gets the grain, I'm leaving a stain 
Piece and chain its bezeltaine, bracelets watch and pinky rings 
Twenty inches to roll, played and stole and pulling hoes 
Serve drank by the four, blowing bud in studios 
Its paying me feddy and cheese, triple beams and doja cream 
Chop on blades and swang on threes, SUV's and Humvees 
The W double O-D, Z-Ro and Enjoli 
He said it once befo', look at what you done to me 
Thought it was over but it ain't, I separate the real and the fake 
You sugar coated bustas, you put the filling in the cake 
I'm still balling while moving J-A-T's, SKA no AMG's 
In the Dirty Third we shipping ki's and, platinum c.d.'s nigga 

[Hook - 2x] 

[Enjoli] 
Little figga to you hoes, and all my foes 
I done squashed the plex so what's next, I rose 
From the bottom to the top, Third Coast won't stop 
Southsive for live, when trunks knocking tops drop 
And the G's body rock, I ride to these 
Looking good gripping wood, with a ounce of the tweed 
Having fun in the sun, making money by the tons 
Stacking papas pulling capas, staying sharp for the evil ones 
So lay it down 'fore the sparks fly 
S.U.C. full of moves, niggas we on the rise 
Hopping outta wide bodies, and it don't stop 
Enjoli be the queen, and you bout's to ride (say what) 
It be so lovely it be so nice, being twice 
Stay blinding you hoes, six figgas and reunite 
Moving state to state, pushing albums like weight 
Better regulate, and still screeeeaming 

[Hook - 3x]
