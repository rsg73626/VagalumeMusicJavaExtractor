HOW DOES IT FEEL

(Chorus - 2x) 
How does it feel, when you can't make the pain stop 
Walking in the rain so your tears can blend in with the rain drops 
When your kin people done turned they back 
Every family that I know is just like that, my nigga how does it feel 

[Z-Ro] 
How does it feel, when they don't believe anything you say 
Always, got to show and prove yourself every single day 
Man this ain't living, nothing but drama all through the week 
And if they don't respect my words, why they want me to speak 
I'm feeling worse, even though I put my family first 
I'm shedding tears cause I feel as if I'm headed to the dirt 
Ghetto on me, stressed out, mama buried ain't dead 
Ain't got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head 
Have you ever told a lie to make the drama stop 
Watch the world you love turn against you no more family problems 
How does it feel to be the black sheep, how does it feel to 
Victimized yourself for one time and evermore after the g 
And roses on the dresser bad, liquor approaching fast 
Sitting around, waiting on death to come, watching time pass 
My life, my life, falls under the wicked and shife 
I wonder where I got to sleep tonight, nigga tell me how does it feel 

(Chorus - 2x) 

[Z-Ro] 
I could of sworn I wasn't the only person on this earth 
But it seems, that I've been one deep ever since the day of my birth 
I'm sick and tired of being lonely in this crooked land, people think 
I'm tripping cause of my facial expressions but they don't understand 
24 years old and use to frowning daily, trying to figure out 
Who was the friend, and who was the foe, you know it's bout to drive me crazy 
Mama, tell Jesus I can't handle the pressure, look at 
The way they do me down here, my vision is Z-Ro on the stretcher 
Can't I breed in peace, won't y'all leave me alone 
Like Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home 
Bout a Mo City block, a place that ain't no glocks, and it ain't no sin 
No longer watching my back for the retaliation 
How does it feel to wish that you was dead, I can 
Answer that cause many of nights my pistol's to my head 
But I'm so scared, my life, my life, 360 degrees 
Of being neglected stressing enemies nigga tell me how does it feel 

(Chorus - 2x) 

[Big Rodsta] 
How does it feel, to be broke in this rap game 
You have skills and fame, but no car in your name 
With dreams for shiny things can you still hang 
But the T lady's house got cracks in the window pain 
How does it feel to have that shit under your seat now 
You must start with your face on these c.d.s now 
What's the deal now, what it do on them zones now 
Got them feds at your door so when you go now 
How does it feel to have these seeds that you can't feed 
And these blocks full of rookies that you can't bleed 
20/20 vision clear day, but you can't see 
That you can't be the broke nigga haters wanna see 
How does it feel to be brave full of street game 
Rap game, dope game, damn near the same thang 
How to maintain, I don't know rings don't bling 
Big Rod looking at the window birds don't sing, how does it feel 

(Chorus - 2x) 

(outro) 
How does it feel, how does it feel 
My nigga how does it feel 
My nigga how does it feel
