BELIEVE

I believe what comes around goes around
There's a place it just makes sense
To be a man where there's meaning in life
There's a message to learn but everybody's concerned
About my bizness, my actions, they're justified
And if we say back off that means step aside
'cause would we do this to you what's your meaning of friend
Or have you given it up I got your friend till the end
And I believe we should be over this
But we always disagree
I believe we learn from each other
And I've had enough this time
I believe in fairness and good things come along
To those who are aware of this
So keep in mind when you're doing your thing
That if it hurts someone it might just bring
Bad karma, dilemmas, they're coming for you
And you'll be giving it up and you'll be giving it up
Then you might learn your lesson
Or maybe you won't, 'cause it's righteousness
Selflessness and everything goes with this
And I believe we should be over this
But we always disagree
I believe we learn from each other
And I've had enough this time
Is this who we are
Have we come too far to tell
If we'll always disagree
