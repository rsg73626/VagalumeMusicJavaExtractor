LET'S CHILL

(Mexican D) 
What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this 
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill 
Come through, blow something, smoke something 
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side 
Letting y'all broads know, we too real 

[Z-Ro] 
What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like you don't know me 
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a little bit lonely 
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of your butt 
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up 
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up all your time 
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind 
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on you 
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke marijuana 
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers through your hair 
Go to the Residance Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of underwear 
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so don't leave no scars 
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars 
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have 
do a little wine and take a little bath 
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you down 
All you got to do is put me in the penn 
got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way 
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something 
Keep it on the low and we could do this today 

[Chorus] 
Let's chill, so I could knock you down 
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you 
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind 
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do 

[Enjoli] 
Ok, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump in my ride 
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside 
With our minds, you got something that I cut for 
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust you 
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls 
Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the curb 
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could receive 
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease 
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill 
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight up and real 
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise 
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife 
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds 
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on your mind 
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late 
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to chill baby 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure 
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been captured 
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away together 
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on the lever 
Get aquatinted with eachother as we feel the Mo City 
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never show pity 
But if you scared, I mean you not alone 
it might be the ghetto but I call it home 
90 percent of the killers are cool with me 
so it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me 
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I was lying 
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in between the thighs 
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance 
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and then slow dance 
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon 
The stereo bumping our slow jam song 
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it on 
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in your life 
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your life 

[Chorus - 3x]
