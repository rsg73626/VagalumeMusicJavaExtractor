FRIENDS

[Z-Ro] 
I thought I had a lot of partnas, but I've only got some 
Since I can't depend on my niggaz, I put my faith up in my shotgun 
Rolling around in my '78, reminiscing on the past 
16 years old trying to get into Boomerang, smelling all our lil cash 
Now it's like we never knew eachother, motherfuckers act strange 
It's like they got intentions, on putting bullets up in my brain 
Why they can't look me in my eyes no mo' 
Even though I miss my T. Jones, at least mama ain't gotta to cry no mo' 
I done seen my nigga get rich, leave the hood, make a lot of rich friends 
But try to come back to the po' partnas, when all the richness end 
Tell him to come watch me perform, but they don't go, and if I'm 
Stranded and I need a ride, they say they coming but they don't show 
Picture me walking down the feeter, everybody masking me up 
Oh good it's that nigga from the hood, chunking a deuce passing me up 
That's alright though, I gotta make a top flight hoe, smoking and thinking 
When I get I want no nobody, but a Benjamin Franklin cause uh 

[Hook - 2x] 
Friends just ain't friends no more 
Ain't no love, cause money is all we adore 
Friends just ain't friends no more 
I don't need you motherfuckers round me

Most of these hoes say they your friend, but they really ain't down 
Cause when you broke and got no ends, them same hoes don't come round 
The main hoes that talk down, most friends turn to foes 
That's just the way it go down, that's why I stay blowing pounds 
Cause Mary Jane don't change she stay the same, help maintain 
And ease the pain, stay free from the bullshit people bring 
Cause the world is full of evil mayn 
That's why I stay one deep, fuck these niggaz and these hoes 
I be solo on my creep, no one in the passenger seat 

[Den Den] 
First he's riding high, now he busting Mack 10's 
Watch you go from homie to foe, then try to come back again 
There ain't no returning with the fuck shit, that's why I murder with one click 
These fake ass G's I'm done with, selling my shit for one sill 
But claiming you down to the ground bitch, bitch you ain't down with 
Just another fake friend, trying to chop the Benz 
Helping to plead my ends, looking for a win 
Lying with a grin, trying to sneak back in

Remember back in '97, we was living it up 
If they had it and we wanted it, they was giving it up 
Through it wrong together, I think we wrote our first song together 
Matter of fact, we smoked our first zone together 
Look at you now oh you a rich nigga, thinking that you running thangs 
But you ain't running a damn thang but your mouth, cause you's a bitch nigga 
Going against the grain, cause you done made a lil change 
But I can't flip the script wanna get rich, I gotta remain the same 
I had visions of us balling together, pulling up at the Past at New Orleans 
Together, everyday all day shot calling together, but now I'm only rolling solo 
Don't get it twisted I still got love for my niggaz, but I don't fuck with em no mo' 
Cause everybody want me to do, what they want me to do 
And they want me to do it, but I'd rather stay full of embalming fluid 
But you know what you can do for me, give me a whole lot of leave me alone 
Cause the only partna I got left, got 17 partnas of his own and uh 

[Hook - 2x]
