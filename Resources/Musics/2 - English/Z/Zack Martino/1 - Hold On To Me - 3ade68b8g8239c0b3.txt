HOLD ON TO ME

Close your eyes
Only got one night
Just put your trust in me
Give me everything
I need your love tonight
So baby please don't fight it
Put your trust in me
I'll give you everything
So hold on to me
Never let me go
Right here in your arms
Is where I want to be
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
so hold on to me
never let me go
right here in your arms
is where I want to be
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
So hold on to me
