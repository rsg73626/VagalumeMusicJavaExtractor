GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU

Lately I, been wondering why
You seem so far from me
Day by day, you slipped away
You're so out of reach from me

It's pulling me apart
To see you in such pain
If only you could let me in
I'll help you break this chain
Together we can find a track
Take it to the moon and back

Baby, if you want me to

I'll go anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere you want me to
I'll go any place, any time, to the end of the line
Out of the dark, I will carry you
I'll go anywhere with you
Baby, anywhere

Come, lay down
By my side
I'll give you what you need
You don't have the put up an act
You know, you can't hide from me

Run away, for a while
Think of something else
Take the pressure of your mind
Oh baby, I can help
Together we can find a track
Take it to the moon and back

Baby, if you want me to

I'll go anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere you want me to
I'll go any place, any time, to the end of the line
Out of the dark, I will carry you
I'll go anywhere with you
Baby, anywhere

I'm running your horizon
And lightening up your days
Fill the sun, come shining
And kiss your face
Together we can find a track
Take it to the moon and back

Baby, if you want me to

I'll go anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere you want me to
I'll go any place, any time, to the end of the line
Out of the dark, I will carry you
I'll go anywhere with you
Baby, anywhere
