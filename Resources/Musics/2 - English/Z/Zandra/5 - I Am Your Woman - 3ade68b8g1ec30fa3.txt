I AM YOUR WOMAN

There is something, you must realize
What you have, what you can lose
I'll be gone one day
Tell me now
If our love was real or just a game
Would you care if just heard my name
I give you one more chance

Together we can make it through
Broken words and lies
I can feel you deep inside my soul
And that's everything

I am the woman in your life
I can show you what is right
Making love all through the night
I am your woman
I will lead you to the light
Everything is out of sight
I'll show you love and all about
I am your woman

Your woman
You're the man I always wanted to give my hand

You never know what you are looking for
So this time you know, you should be sure
Hear me now, what I am telling you
You must believe, can't you see that you belong to me
This time it's serious

Together we can make it through
Broken words and lies
I can feel you deep inside my soul
And that's everything

I am the woman in your life
I can show you what is right
Making love all through the night
I am your woman
I will lead you to the light
Everything is out of sight
I'll show you love and all about
I am the woman in your life

I am the woman in your life
I can show you what is right
Making love all through the night
I am your woman
I will lead you to the light
Everything is out of sight
I'll show you love and all about
I am your woman

Your woman
You're the man I always wanted to give my hand

I am
