LET YOU FLY

Lying here writing ´bout us, trying to keep the distance from the cellphone / While the coffee´s pouring out in the kitchen, I´m kissing the shirt of yours / Outside there are thousands of snowflakes /  Wonder what it´ll be like when the spring and the sun wakes / Gonna take a little while, figuering out what´s inside / There´s a little sparkle that you´ve turned into life / Gotta let you go now, gonna let you fly / Good times come and they go, only God knows why / And he plants odd thoughts into my mind / If I let you go now, when the love´s still alive /  We´re assured that there´ll always be a you and I / Damn, you keep your fingers crossed and don´t walk under that latter / My strength gone with ease, like the wind carrying away a feather / Waiting for a fall, searching for perfection, now won´t you cut it off, don´t need a single day more in your direction / Forgetting the slush and the cars and the gutter / You´ve got her to smile, yeah you´ve really got her / Gonna take a little while, figuering out what´s inside / There´s a little sparkle that you´ve turned into life / We´re only a book of one paper, only a brick in that big skyscraper / But I love you yeah / And that´s good enough
