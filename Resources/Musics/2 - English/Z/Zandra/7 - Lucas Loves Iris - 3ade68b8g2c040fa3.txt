LUCAS LOVES IRIS

They both liked music and grew up in the same town     / A little town with people who did everything to keep each other down   / They worked and lived on different sides of the city and with different kinds of circumstances   / He had it coming, he had it all    / She played her piano, she knew what it was like to fall    / He loved the city and the people who lived there    / He would become someone big someday    / He worked at his father’s firm and  knew what was coming    / But some things sometimes turns out to be, something that  wasn’t planned to be, something    / Because, Lukas loves Iris and Iris loves Lukas    / They just don’t care right now what people will say    / If destiny wants it then they’ll be together    / Now and forever, let love lead the way    / She loved the winter and the loneliness    / Twinkles and starlight and happiness    / She hardly earned enough to pay the bill once a week   / But she once swore to God that she would never be, out of will to stand up on her feet /  and hope is one thing that she’ll always keep    / And once in a while they cross each other /  once in a while she says hello and he smiles    / Once in a while they belong to each other and they both know why
