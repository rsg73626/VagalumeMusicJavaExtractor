BREATHE

I always tell you the truth, because I want you to know / I´m afraid that you think I´m trying out how far I can go / One misstake can make a heartbreak but I never lie and I know how to cry / I swear I didn´t feel a thing / And I was unawared ´bout the pain it would bring / but if we´re worth more than a lie / can´t we give it one more try / I´m sure we´ve cried equally and we lied a little bit / and while we hate eachother openly / we´re planning to get over it / oh, baby won´t you look at me / listen, open up and try to breathe / I never tell you a lie and I thought that you knew / and I refuse to go through another night like this feeling this blue / I´ve cried enough when it was all that I could do /  but I learned one thing / I love you /  And I´m sorry, for everything and for every way I´ve hurt you
