MY HEART

It wasn´t long time ago, since I saw that pretty smile / it wasn´t long time ago, since I saw those sparkling eyes / In a peppermint rock dress and her doll to her chest / she stood proudly watching daddy take the photo of her life / to remember of a time, when fairytales were alive / oh no, that wasn´t long time ago / Now, My heart´s speaking that´s all I know / That my heart´s speaking now wherever I go / With my boots, I´m taking the freeway, I´m off / with this ocean wide love that I´ve got / Yeah, this cowgirl has got enough / You gotta earn it baby / Gotta care for maybes / They say that´s all there is / To survive this business / Always knowing what you´re doing, though your legs almost can´t bare / Are you there to share my dreams and remember once in a while / How the school was burnt down and mommy was a clown / I know, that wasn´t long time ago / I love to watch your fingers on my fingers as you dream away / And playin´that you´re flying like a bird / Up in blue and singing like the angels / whispering softly you breathe in / before you´re saying I love you
