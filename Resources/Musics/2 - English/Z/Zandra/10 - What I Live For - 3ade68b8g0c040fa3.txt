WHAT I LIVE FOR

Don’t regret the time, the thought of the fact that you were lonely    / Loneliness is just a name, a game, the price to pay to get the funky /   I wasn’t drifting, / I was swimming    / Little in my shoes, little in my dress,   / tiny as I was, could have cared less   / This small town made me cry,   / but here I am, I smile    / No money, not poor,   / it’s not what I live for   / Fighter,   you walk the mile, you run the heat    / You climb the wall, you scrub your knees,   / Life is bout believe    / Don’t ever loose the grip of love,   / Love for every dream you’ve got    / It’s a struggle being free,  I find strength in being me   / I’m not scared of being foolish or embarrassed, I’m just human    / And making to much gossip, crap is always coming back to you   / I were just walking   / Hearing myself talking    / Making music in the garden,   / And the bird’s my only friend    / Looking at the blue sky, wondering were it’s been   / I knew someday I´d feel the wind beneath my sails   / No being indoor, it’s not what I live for   / Every little girl has her problems, like a weight over her chest   / I should have twist that little nose, when he trampled on my toes    / That would have been ok, but, thank you anyway
