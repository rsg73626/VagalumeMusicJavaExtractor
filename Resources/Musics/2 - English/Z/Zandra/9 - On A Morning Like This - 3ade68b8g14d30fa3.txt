ON A MORNING LIKE THIS

Who's that girl, walking down the street now
(Oh yeah) I've got news for you
She stand on her own feet now (Oh yeah)

I'm finally free
There's nothing or no one I need

On a morning like this
I just feel like, everything is allright
Yesterday was upside down
On a morning like this
I just feel like, nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna hold me down
There's nothing that I miss
On a morning like this 

Who's that boy, telling me you're sorry
(Oh yeah) You know it's too late for that
And I'm not gonna worry (Oh no)

Cause I'm standing tall
I feel I'm OK after all

On a morning like this
I just feel like, everything is allright
Yesterday was upside down
On a morning like this
I just feel like, nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna hold me down
There's nothing that I miss
On a morning like this

On a morning like this
(Uh-uh-yeah) 
On a morning like 
(Uh-uh-yeah)
There's nothing that I miss 

On a morning like this
I just feel like, everything is allright
Yesterday was upside down
On a morning like this
I just feel like, nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna hold me down
On a morning like this

Yesterday was upside down
On a morning like this
I just feel like, nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna hold me down
There's nothing that I miss on a morning like this
