CAN'T STOP LOVIN' YOU

You showed me things inside myself
I never knew were there before
I'm stronger than I thought I was
It's like you've opened up the door

I have much more to give
I have more life to live
That's why

I just can't stop lovin' you
It's the only thing I ever do
I just can't stop lovin' you
Love you more than I could ever do

Nobody can know, what I want, what I need
What I get from you
Nobody can know what I feel for you
I just can't stop lovin' you

You gave me strength when I was down
Put my feet back on the ground
You showed me how to choose my past
So I can be myself at last

I have much more to give
I have more life to live
That's why

I just can't stop lovin' you
It's the only thing I ever do
I just can't stop lovin' you
Love you more than I could ever do

Nobody can know, what I want, what I need
What I get from you
Nobody can know what I feel for you
I just can't stop lovin' you

I can't see you
No matter where I am
Cause I think of you
All the time, and I'd love to live my life with you

I just can't stop lovin' you
It's the only thing I ever do
I just can't stop lovin' you
Love you more than I could ever do

Nobody can know, what I want, what I need
What I get from you
Nobody can know what I feel for you
I just can't stop lovin' you
