SUDDENLY NOTHING

We were on the way
Shot out into the night
Leaves falling through limbs
Of old memories of you

But what’s been said is gone
All that’s left is stone

We could not live on
They took the land from home
Stars collide with night
Night collides with depth

And suddenly its gone
Back to where it came from
And suddenly there’s you
Standing all alone.

Suddenly it’s nothing
Suddenly it’s nothing
