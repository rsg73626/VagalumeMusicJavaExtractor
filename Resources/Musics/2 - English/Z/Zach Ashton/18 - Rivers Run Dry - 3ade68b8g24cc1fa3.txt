RIVERS RUN DRY

Rivers Run Dry

My love for you was like a flowing river,
And you drank me up.. you took too much,
Now my bed is stone.
And over the shallows,
where once the water kissed you…
there flies a bird, though he flies alone.
And he flies away…into unknown tomorrows,
And he waits for the water to return.
Until that day he sings his song of sorrow,
And I wait for him to change his tune.

Oh bird, are you singing just for me?
Or are there other rivers that run dry?
Oh bird please fly away and see.
I need to know if she’s alright.

So he flies away…
Though desert sands and mountains.
His wings are tired…
but his strength is in his song.
And he comes to green wide open pastures,
Cut with a river painted the deepest blue.
So he stops to drink and then he sees her.
She swims in the shallows,
Just like she did before.
He sings his song though she can’t hear him…
For she drinks the water of another love.

Oh bird, are you singing just for me?
Or are there other rivers that run dry?
Oh bird please fly away and see.
I need to know if she’s alright.
