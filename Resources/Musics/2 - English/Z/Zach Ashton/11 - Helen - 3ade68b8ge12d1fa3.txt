HELEN

Well we took off.
And we left our families at home…
And they told me we were fighting for love,
But my love was not gone. 
Oh Helen of Troy what you done for me?
Oh Helen of Troy you’ll destroy me. 
Oh Helen of Troy what you done for me?
Oh Helen of Troy you’ll destroy me. 

And her face was just like a box of Crayolas.
Spread out on paper- and I don’t want to see her.

She had a face just like the tigers of Africa.
Fooling scholars and other wise men.
And I don’t know why he sent ships after he.
To catch her would sure be his end.

And her face was just like a box of Crayolas.
Spread out on paper- and I don’t want to see her.

Her place was just like the palace of India.
You can look but you can never go in.
And I don’t know why he sent me after her.
Oh to catch her would sure be my end.

Oh Helen of Troy what you done for me?
Oh Helen of Troy you’ll destroy me. 
Oh Helen of Troy what you done for me?
Oh Helen of Troy you’ll destroy me. 
You’ll destroy me.
You’ll destroy me.
