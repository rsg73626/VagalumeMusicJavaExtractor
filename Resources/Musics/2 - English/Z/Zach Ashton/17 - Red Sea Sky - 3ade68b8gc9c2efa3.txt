RED SEA SKY

Living on the sand for a while
Taking everything that we could
I could be somebody you want
Take a chance

Emptiness is part of the wind
Heat rises up from the ground
We can be whatever we want
If we want

Under the red sea sky I thought about everything we've done.
Follow the dark of night you'll find the way to get back to the sun
Under the sinai moon you say the names of people that you’ve loved
Follow the dark of night you'll find the way to get back what you've lost

Color in a colorless land
Mountains are fading away
Faces come out of the stone
Of the stone

Staring at the sea, it’s alive
Drinking tea in the afternoon sun
We can be wherever we want
Sometimes

Under the red sea sky I thought about everything we've done.
Follow the dark of night you'll find the way to get back to the sun
Under the sinai moon you say the names of people that you’ve loved
Follow the dark of night you'll find the way to get back what you've lost
