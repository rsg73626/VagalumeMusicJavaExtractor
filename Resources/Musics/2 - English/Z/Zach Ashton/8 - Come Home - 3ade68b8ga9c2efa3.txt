COME HOME

The lights at the bar turn on to signal she’s leaving
And the late night they crowd all want her to go
She looks at her phone and reads a message from the evening
“Come home”

And you step outside into the world you know its freezing
And you think of how your mother always said “take a coat”
And you wonder if you’ll ever find a reason
To come home

The party’s always better when your with someone you know
Stick with me a while, we’ll tear this town apart.. oh oh oh oh
Together we’ll be partners in a crime
No witness to our love, you and I wanted by everyone

And you wait by the window to hear for when she’s coming
And a taxi pulls up and the door slams shut and its gone
And the boots on the stairs make a sound that’s so familiar
Come home

The party’s always better when your with someone you know
Stick with me a while, we’ll tear this town apart.. oh oh oh oh
Together we’ll be partners in a crime
No witness to our love, you and I wanted by everyone

The lights at the bar turn on to signal she’s leaving
And the late night they crowd all want her to go
She looks at her phone and reads a message from the evening
“Come home”
