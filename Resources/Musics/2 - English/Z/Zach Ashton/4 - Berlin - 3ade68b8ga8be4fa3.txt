BERLIN

You say
You're going
Away
To Berlin

Oh, Paula don't you understand
That I'm hanging on you now
Oh, Paula don't you understand
That we can work it out

I have been in so many places
Seen so many towns
If you're leaving in the morning
Take me with you now

You could go to
Paris, France
Or even
London, England
Or maybe
China
I'll be
Right behind ya

Oh, Paula don't you understand
That I'm hanging on you now
Oh, Paula don't you understand
That we can work it out

I have been in so many places
Seen so many towns
If you're leaving in the morning
Take me with you now

And would it be the same
If I never went away?
And would it be the same
If you had asked me just to stay?

You say
You're going
Away
To Berlin
To Berlin
To Berlin

Oh, Paula don't you understand
That I'm hanging on you now
Oh, Paula don't you understand
That we can work it out

I have been in so many places
Seen so many towns
If you're leaving in the morning
Take me with you now
If you're leaving in the morning
Take me with you now
I say if you're leaving in the morning
Take me with you now
