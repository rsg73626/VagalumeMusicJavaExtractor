CLOSER THAN THIS

Why do we do the things we do
Is there destiny in every step

Don’t you cry my child, life will work it out.

They said we could accomplish anything
They said we could be anyone
Don’t you cry my child, life will work it out.
Don’t you cry my child, we can work it out.

I want to be, a little bit closer than this
I want say things on my mind
I want to heal, the wounds of my soul, from so long ago.

They say the world has open hands
She gives she takes in circumstance
I said id give my world to you
What is love if its not true

Don’t you cry my child, life will work it out.
Don’t you cry my child, we can work it out.

I want to be, a little bit closer than this
I want say things on my mind
I want to heal, the wounds of my soul, from so long ago.
