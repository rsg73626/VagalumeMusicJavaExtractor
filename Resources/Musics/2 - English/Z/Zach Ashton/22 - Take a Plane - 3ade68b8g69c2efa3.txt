TAKE A PLANE

Why you wanna give a blame to this distance between us.
Why do you wanna point a finger at someone?

Why we have to make it up and tell our friends stories?
Why we always have to be the one who wins?

Now you wanna take a plane, leave it all behind you.
We always want the other side of what we got.

The other side, a place you wanna go when things aren't working right.
Baby, please stay tonight.

We'll talk it out.
You know that with is always better than without.

Why you wanna give a name to this feeling between us?
Why do you wanna build it up just to tear it down?

Now you wanna take a plane, leave it all behind you.
We always want the other side of what we got.

The other side, a place you wanna go when things aren't working right.
Baby, please stay tonight.

We'll talk it out.
You know that with is always better than without.
