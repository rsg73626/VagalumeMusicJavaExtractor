ANGELS

The angels must have smiled,
When you were just a child.
Oh to look at you then...
Must have been heaven.

And I was just a boy
doing things that boys always do...
oh running around town,
Chasing heaven.

And we don't know just where we'll go.
And we can't see who we'll be.
But I want to be closer to heaven.
And I want to see us closer to heaven.

The angels must have flown,
When you had finally grown.
Oh to be with you then...
Must have been heaven.

And I became a man.
Doing things a mans got to do.
Making my way.
Trying to make it to heaven.

And we don't know just where we'll go.
And we can't see who we'll be.
But I want to be closer to heaven.
And I want to see us closer to heaven.

And all these days are delicate.
For we don't know when we'll go.
So treat your days as delicate
For we can't foresee tomorrow.
