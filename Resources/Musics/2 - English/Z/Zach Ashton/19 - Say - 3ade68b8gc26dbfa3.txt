SAY

Say
Something before it's too late
And we're walking alone
Tears falling like diamonds in a waterfall
Oh, to know is not to know at all
Could there be anything more laughable?
The picture's perfect but the frame is broke

Stay 
A little bit longer now
The show must go on somehow
And we're building up walls 
Confusion like butterflies in a hurricane
Oh, to know is not the same
And we live in separate hemispheres
I can't touch you but your body's near
Could there be anything more laughable?
The picture's perfect but the frame is broke

If saints come marching in
Into this love
Is that the end?
If God could save us now
Would you run or would you bow?

If saints come marching in
Into this love, is that the end?
If God could save us now 
Would you run or would you bow?
