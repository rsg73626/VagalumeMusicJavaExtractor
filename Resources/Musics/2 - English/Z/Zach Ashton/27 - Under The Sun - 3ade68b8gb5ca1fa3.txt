UNDER THE SUN

I will try, I will try. I will try.
‘Cause Abraham had many sons,
And you and I are one.
So why can’t we just live together.

Under the sun we live as kings,
But we die just as men.
Under the sun I tried at love and I lost a friend.
Under the stars I don’t know if I will survive,
But I’m living.

I will try, I will try. I will try.
‘Cause Abraham had many sons,
And you and I are one.
So why can’t we just live together.

I will try, I will try. I will try.
Yes, I will try, I will try. I will try.

‘Cause Abraham had many sons,
And you and I are one.
So why can’t we just live together.

Under the sun.
Yes under the sun…
Under the sun.
Yes under the sun.
