ONCE I WAS

Once I was a soldier with a gun in a country far from home in the night
Once I was a cowboy on the run
Money for my life dead or alive

Show me the life that’s good
Make it a life worth living
I used to take it all
But now is the time for giving

Once I was a captain lost at sea
My treasures drowning me, like a stone

Once I was a gypsy with a guitar
I never got too far, but I never tried

Show me the life that’s good
Make it a life worth living
I used to take it all
But now is the time for giving

You could say I’ve lived everything before
But I’ve never been to a place like this
You could say I’ve lived a thousand years or more
But I’ve never felt quite like this
