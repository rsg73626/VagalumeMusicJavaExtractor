TODAY

Today, I want to give you all
The time we had apart. Here I am.

Today, I want to touch your soul
I’ll buy you something small, just to show you I care

Today, I’ll cook you something good
We’ll cruise the neighborhood
We’ll watch the kids play in the park

Today, Today, Today, Today

We can do anything you want
Give you pennies for your thoughts, or the wishing well
You can wear your favorite dress
Maybe we can dance, or play your favorite song

Today, Today, Today, Today
I want to give you all the time we had apart
Today today

I’ll give you all you need. You’ll be my everything
Today, Today, Today, Today

I want to touch your soul
Pennies for your thoughts
Wear your favorite dress
Play your favorite song.
