CHILDREN

Well children don’t you know?
You can’t believe all the things…
That you see on the TV screen.. Oh no!

They’re telling lies of damnation.
They’re throwing stones at your reputation.
Children don’t you see?
It’s education that sets you free,
From the political monarchy…
Of the media… I said Oh children! 

Newspapers, journals, magazines…
They all come from the same machine.
Printing lies from currency- Oh children! 
They can’t believe them now…
No you can’t believe!
Said you can’t believe them now!

Oh children!
Oh children!
