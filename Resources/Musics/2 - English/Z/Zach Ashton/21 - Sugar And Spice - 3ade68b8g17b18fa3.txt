SUGAR AND SPICE

Sugar and spice
I would search the world for you
Climb aboard a sailing ship
And sail the oceans to you
So if you see me coming
Please, don't go running
'Cause you know I am 
Your lovin' man

Sugar and spice
I would buy the stars for you
If they named their price
I would give them all to you

So if you see me coming
Please, don't go running
'Cause you know I am 
Your lovin' man

So if you see me coming
Please, don't go running
'Cause you know I am 
Your lovin' man

Your lovin' man
