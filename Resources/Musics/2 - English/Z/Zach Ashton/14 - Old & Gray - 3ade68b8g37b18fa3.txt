OLD & GRAY

When I’m old and gray I hope to say your still with me
And the promises we make today they come true.
And I hope in time you’ll find the mind to remember me…
The way I was when I first met you

And these are the days we’ll talk about then
The pictures we take we’ll hold in our hands
Of memories we made way back when…
I first met you.

We started out on your apartment down by the beachside.
I had an old camera and id spend my time taking black and whites
And you said to me we got to get out of this city…
WeÂ’re still young and there’s so much I want to see.

And these are the days we’ll talk about then
The pictures we take we’ll hold in our hands
Of memories we made way back when…
I first met you.

And I don’t know where we’re going.
But I know where we’ve been.
And the days of my life aren’t slowing.
Will I see you in the end?

And these are the days we'll talk about then
The pictures we take we’ll hold in our hands
Of memories we made way back when…
I first met you.
