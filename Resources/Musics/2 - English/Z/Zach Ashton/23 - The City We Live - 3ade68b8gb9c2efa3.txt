THE CITY WE LIVE

You run. You Fall.
You’re chasing the wind. Your horses are strong, but they never win.
You laugh. You smile.
Something is missing. Your web is wide, but nothing is sticking.

The city we live is where love goes to die
The people we meet, all say goodbye
But if you ask them to stay, they will find a way
To a place that one day we'll call home

It's lonely sometimes in the dead of night
The streetlights flicker inside my mind
All I wanna be is a little bit closer
When we get together we’re so much stronger

You sing your songs,
But no-ones listening. you draw your guns, when no one’s shooting
You spend it all
You’re saving nothing.
You want everything, but no one’s giving

The city we live is where love goes to die
The people we meet, all say goodbye.
But if you ask them to stay, they will find a way
To a place that one day we'll call home

When everyone seems so far away
I close my eyes and I see your face
All I wanna be is a little bit closer
When your not around its so much colder

It's lonely sometimes in the dead of night
The streetlights flicker inside my mind
All I wanna be is a little bit closer
When we get together we’re so much stronger.
