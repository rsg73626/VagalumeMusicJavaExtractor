AM I DREAMING?

This time might be the last time...
So lets make the best of it.
This time might be the only time…
So let’s not go to quick.

I want to swim in the ocean of your arms,
And taste the salt on your skin.
Drown in your covers,
To be saved by your lips.

This time might be the perfect time.
For me to say to you.
I’ve waited such a long time.
To be here with you.

Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
