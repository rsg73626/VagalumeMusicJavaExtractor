LOSING

Well, there was a girl named Sharon
And she moved away to Spain
If we met in Barcelona
Would she even know my name?
And there was a boy named David
They say he's living in LA
And I haven't even seen them
Since my graduation day
Oh,we are losing touch with our past
Everyday that goes by
And we aren't choosing
To live our lives in the American style
And there was a girl named Ren√©e
They say she split tihs town
She live somewhere im Germany
I think she's married now
And there was a boy named Mathew
He played a mean guitar
And I haven't even seen than
Since I drove away my car
Oh, we are losing...
Oh, sometimes I cry
When I think about all the people
I have somehow left behind
Never knowing if I'll see them again
And sometimes we need
To pick up the phone and call those ones
That we have not seen
In such a long time
I think I'm losing
