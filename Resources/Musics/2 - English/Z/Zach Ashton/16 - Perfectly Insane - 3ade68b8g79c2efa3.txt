PERFECTLY INSANE

Is it delicate? Can we break this thing we got
Are we honest? Will the truth tear us apart
Is it serious? Do we need to tell our friends?
Is it  starting or is it coming to an end?

I heard you leaving but I stayed in bed
Your perfume lingers and it makes me mad
I wonder if you'll ever understand

Everybody wants what we got
But we don’t know if its broken or not
Are we perfect? Are we perfectly insane

Nobody ever seems to understand
We’re miles apart but we’re holding hands
Are we perfect, perfectly insane
Perfect, perfectly insane.

Are we jealous? Do we wish that we would fall?
Is it fading, are the colors running out?
Is it serious? Do we need to tell our friends?
Is it  starting or is it coming to an end?

I saw you walking on the street alone
I know its crazy but I let you go
I wonder if you’ll ever know

Everybody wants what we got
But we don’t know if its broken or not
Are we perfect? Are we perfectly insane

Nobody ever seems to understand
We’re miles apart but we’re holding hands
Are we perfect, perfectly insane
Perfect, perfectly insane.
