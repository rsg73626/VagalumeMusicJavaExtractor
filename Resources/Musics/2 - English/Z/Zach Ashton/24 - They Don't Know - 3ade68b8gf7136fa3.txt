THEY DON'T KNOW

Well I was
Travelling to
All the places
That you and I know

And I saw
People I've never seen before
Looking at me standing by the door
Looking for you

And they stared
Like I wasn't supposed to be there
But I didn't care
I didn't care 'cause they don't know
They don't know
They don't know
No, they don't know
