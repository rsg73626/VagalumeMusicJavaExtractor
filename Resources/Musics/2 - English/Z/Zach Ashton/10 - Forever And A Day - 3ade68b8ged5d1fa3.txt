FOREVER AND A DAY

Forever and a Day

We destiny is falling down…all around.
I don’t know if I can hang on now. 
Sometimes in this life 
we must let go of things we love,
and let them fade away. 
Old man do you have some advice to offer me?
For you know this road I’m on so well.
Well son he says to me 
”love comes and goes. And you can’t fight it…
sometimes things just weren’t meant to be.
“So be strong and take long…”
to find the one your heart is dreaming of.”

And we see destiny is falling down… all around.
But I know it’s time to let you go.
Memories fading fast… 
I wish I could make the good ones last…
Forever and a day.

So fade away…
Fade away….
