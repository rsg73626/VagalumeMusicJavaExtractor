BRIDGES

Bridges


She builds he bridges, just to burn them down.
Her heart’s an island, with no ships to be found.
So I sail to her in a sea of love,
And though I don’t have wind enough…
To conquer the currents pushing me down. 
Well I don’t know, but I’ve been told…
If you throw your anchor close..
When the sun goes down,
A shadow sometimes kisses you.
It’s a story of a thousand years, a thousand ships…
And a million tears.
This Island won’t be broken.

It’s so sad these things she’s seen.
The sunken ships, the sunken dreams.
Although I try I know it’s hopeless.

So I pull my line and sail away.
Knowing that she’ll sail someday.
But will my island be of welcome.
