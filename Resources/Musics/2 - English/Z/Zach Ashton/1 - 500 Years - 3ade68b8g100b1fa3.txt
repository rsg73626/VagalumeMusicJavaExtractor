500 YEARS

500 years ago they sailed the sea in search of gold,
for the king and queen of Portugal.
A savage land was what they found…
So they sent their slaves to cut it down.
What has been done will not be forgotten.

Amazon where have you gone?
Amazon where have you gone?
They cut you. They cut you. 
They cut you. They cut you. 

500 years ago they sailed the sea in search of gold,

They cut you. They cut you. 
They cut you. They cut you. 
Down, Down, Down….

For the company.
Just for the factory.
They said for prosperity.
They said humanity.

They cut you. They cut you. 
They cut you. They cut you. 
Down, Down, Down….
