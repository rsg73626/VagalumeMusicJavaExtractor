OCEAN

ocean take me to your shore.
I haven't been there in so long, so long
wind-blown sand on my skin,
Oh what I'd do to feel you again...again

And there's a girl i want to share you with.
she's so far away
you are her gift
ocean, bring her, down

ocean take me to your shore.
I haven't seen you in so long, so long
wind-blown sand on my skin,
Oh what I'd do to feel you again...again

And there's a girl i want to share you with.
she's so far away
you are her gift
ocean, bring her, down

baby, you know I'm dying and crying for you
to come on down to my ocean town
come on down and...
come on down and...
come on down and...
come on down to my ocean town
ocean town why don't you?

come on down and...
come on down and...
come on down and...
come on down to my ocean town
ocean town why don't you?

I said...
come on down and...
come on down and...
come on down and...
