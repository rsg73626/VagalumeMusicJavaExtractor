SERIOUS

Tell me right now
Tell me right now
I need to know
If you're serious

I can't beleive
Is it a dream?
The way you look
Under these stars tonight
Your smiling at me
I'm smiling at you
I need to know if I should make my move

'cause the nights almost over
And I better know ya!
(I better know ya)
And you've been on my mind
Since the time that I saw you
Baby take my hand and come with me!

Tell me right now

Am I just waisting time thinking about you, tonight?
(Baby, Im serious)
Am I just waisting time thinking about you, tonight?
(Baby, Im serious)

The nights almost gone
And it be so wrong
If you didn't dance with me before you leave
'Cause I never had
This feeling I have
I'm hoping you feel the same way as I do

'cause the nights almost over
And I better know ya!
(I better know ya)
And you've been on my mind
Since the time that I saw you
Baby take my hand and come with me!
