WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE?

What can I do, what can I say
To make you want me more
To have your love and show you more
That's all I'm asking for,
I've been around the block so many times
And I need a place to stop

I only want whats right for you
And you could be right for us
I hear the same thing all the time
And you know that I don't care
I don't like the way your hanging around
And I sure don't like your hair

Ooo oooh
Why won't you give me your love?
Ooo oooh
Why won't you give me your love?

I chain you up I make you mine I keep you
Locked downstairs with all the bugs
And all the rats I'll feed you rodent hair
I'll keep you in my celler safe
And I'll keep you there 'till dawn
I'll wait until the sun comes up
Then I'll poke and prod you more into your tired
And your having a date
But that don't mean much to me
And when I see you out in town
I'm gonna hide so you can't see

Ooo oooh
Why wont you give me your love?
Ooo oooh
Why wont you give me tour love?

Why wont you give me your love,
Why wont you give me your love,
Why wont you give me your love,
Why wont you give me your love (give me your love)
Why wont you give me your love (give me your love)
Why wont you give me your love?
