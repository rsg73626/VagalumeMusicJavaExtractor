HAUNTS ME

It was a long time ago, but it still haunts me. 
Well the good times are payin', 
but the bad times they come free. 
It's been a good few years in the lonely lane, 
but still it lingers like a stain. 

It was a long time ago 
but it still haunts me. 
I've got a hole in my head 
and it just won't let me be. 
Well somedays I'm happy, and other days I just weep. 
Well if I told you what 
I done that day, I know you'll never talk to me again. 

It was a long time ago but it still haunts me. 
All the time I'm hangin' out, and dodgin' all the danger. 
Oh.. I dream of days when I was young, 
and I was just a stranger. 
Oh.. Now don't you worry yourself, 
'cause your friend now lives in peace. 
Even though you had to bury all the evidence in the seat. 
The found his head and his brains in an open bag, 
at the bottom where a war-torn ship had sailed. 

It was a long time ago, but it still haunts me. 
All the time I'm hangin' out and dodgin' all the danger. 
I dream of days when I was young, and I was just a stranger. 

Oh.. Haunts me. Haunts me. 
Haunts me. Haunts me. Haunts me. 
Haunts me. Haunts me. Yea yea yea yea yeah....
