SECRETS

Everyone's got secrets
dirty little secrets
Have i got one on you
(Have i got one on you)
Although they may be secrets,
they may show your weakness
Well are they really true
(well are they really true)

Don't tell your mates
on the council estates
cos there's no one to trust
Don't tell the sky as it spits down in your eye
but tell the priest if you must

cos everyone's got problems
everyone's got problems
And everyone's got stress
Controlling our relations avoiding situations
That end up in a mess

Don't be afraid
if your thoughts are mislaid
cos there's nothing to fear
Don't get upset if your memories
make regrets because we've all got them here

Secrets, secrets, secrets
Are for keeping, keeping, keeping
And if you tell them
They lose their meaning

Don't tell your mates
on the council estates
cos there's no one to trust
Don't tell the sky as it spits down in your eye
but tell the priest if you must

Secrets, secrets, secrets
Are for keeping, keeping, keeping
And if you tell them
They lose their meaning x 2

Everyone's got secrets
dirty little secrets
Have i got one on you
(Have i got one on you)
Although they may be secrets,
they may show your weakness
Well are they really true
(well are they really true) x 3
