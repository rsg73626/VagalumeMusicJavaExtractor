HOW DOES IT FEEL?

How does it feel to have love to have lost
And i know how to feel anymore
And how many times do you have to be cruel to be kind
And show feelings the door
Well isn't it strange how much you can change
in a year or minute or more
How can it go from so good to so bad
and my soul is now squished on the floor

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel on your own
when you can't even deal with yourself

How can i move the ground is so loose
And the sun wants to peel off my skin
And how can i laugh when my mouth is held back
And i'm struggling now just to grin
I hold myself up till i run out of luck
While the world carries on in a spin
And now it's so real and it's paying off well
cos my feelings are letting me in

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel on your own
when you can't even deal with yourself

I've been asking the same old questions
time and time again
I find that i don't want to live this life
but i know that i'll have to pretend
Cos everyone's hiding from the truth
and they're just lying to themselves
How do you expect me to deal
with this when i can't even deal with myself

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel on your own
when you can't even deal with yourself

I've been asking the same old questions time and time again
I find that i don't want to live this life
but i know that i'll have to pretend
Cos everyone's hiding from the truth
and they're just lying to themselves
How do you expect me to deal
with this when i can't even deal with myself
