I KNOW I'LL NEVER LEAVE

There's something going on 'round here, in this neighb ourhood
But what it is i'm not quite sure, in this neighbourhood
I just can't put my finger on, what makes me bite my nails,
and later on i feel the same, as though i would.
The people never say hello, they just walk on past
I try to look inside those cars, but its blackened glass.
I hear the screams late at night, behind my bedroom wall
And later on i'll do the same, and hear the drunk man call

Well i know i'll never leave, 'cos there's no way out for me
Now and then i tend to dream, dream of what might be

Well i know i'll nver leave, cos there's no way out for me.
There's a fear that i know, If i left where would i go?

The pavement has a cactus skin, and a knife like edge.
My feet keep sticking to the floor, where my toes have bled.
I hear the screams late at night, behind my bedroom wall.
And later on i'll do the same, and hear the drunk man call.
Where's the love that i once had? It's dying somewhere in the past
I sold my TV, radio. To someone, someone i don't know

Well i know i'll never leave, 'cos there's no way out for me
Now and then i tend to dream, dream of what might be

Well i know i'll nver leave, cos there's no way out for me.
There's a fear that i know, If i left where would i go?

Well i know i'll never leave, 'cos there's no way out for me
Now and then i tend to dream, dream of what might be

Well i know i'll nver leave, cos there's no way out for me.
There's a fear that i know, If i left where would i go?
