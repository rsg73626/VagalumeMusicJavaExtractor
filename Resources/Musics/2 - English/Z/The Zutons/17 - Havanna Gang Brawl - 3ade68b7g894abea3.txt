HAVANNA GANG BRAWL

Well the cops are at the door
and you know that they want more
theyve got spears made for arms
try to lure you with their charms
you can hear the guns outside 
watching riots with their eyes
as you move from wall to wall
hear the siren from the gang brawl
Line the locals one by one
filling bullets with their guns
are you red or if you're blue
cos tonight their gonna find the truth
take no prisoners today
for the future will be laid
one big city, one big town
everyone with the same crown
Havana gang brawl
havana gang brawl
havana gang brawl
oh where will you sleep tonight?
oh where will you sleep tonight?
A doomed old day for engagements
they have torn up your arrangements
all the mothers buyin razors
for the future will be dangerous
you try desperately to leave
but all trains are dry for steam
all the taxis on their sides
all the planes are burnin bright
Havana gang brawl
havana gang brawl
havana gang brawl
oh where will you sleep tonight?
oh where will you sleep tonight?
Only one option left
to survive or you'll be dead
do you hide now from the sin?
or do your blazing guns begin?
all the shops are up for sale
you might make it out on bail
all the fathers shine today
making sure that son's ok
Havana gang brawl
havana gang brawl
havana gang brawl
oh where will you sleep tonight?
oh where will you sleep tonight?
oh where will you sleep tonight?
oh where will you sleep tonight?
uh huh.....
