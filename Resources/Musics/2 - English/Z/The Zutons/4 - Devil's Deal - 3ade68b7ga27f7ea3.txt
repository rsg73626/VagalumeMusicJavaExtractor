DEVIL'S DEAL

I was sold a story with a new beginning
I missed out the middle and came into an end
That was told by a man with a different posture
Turn around and I'll meet you at the end
I walk along think nothing can touch me
I missed out the car and found myself in hell
At the gate is a guy says I got a second chance
Turn around and pick one off the shelf
I said pick one off the shelf

Cos I've sold my whole life away
No more riches or fame
And alls I had to do was change
I got my change, the right amount, for who I was

Well listen up I've got a story to tell you
Just pick the end you always wanna hear
But you gotta make sure you pick the right one
Or else this day will end up living tears

And I've sold my whole life away
No more riches or fame
And alls I had to do was change
I got my change, the right amount, for who I was
