TIRED OF HANGING AROUND

These should be the best days of your life
But you worried all the goodness away
And these should be the times you remember the most
But you haven’t got the patience today

Down at the station a driver leaves late
Everyone’s day is adrift
(something)
it’s lost you all respect
so you better get your boss a gift

‘cause we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
oh oooooooh

the bus turned up and you wouldn’t believe
the driver had an attitude
he gave my (?) a ticket, he gave me no respect, it’s got me in a terrible mood

he’s oblivious to all the pain he’s caused
all the pain that he’s about to make
well I hope the next person to be the wrong person
will wipe that stupid look off his face

‘cause we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
oh oooooooh

These should be the best days of our lives
But we worried all the goodness away
And these should be the times we remember the most
But we haven’t got the patience today

‘cause we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around

yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around

yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of hanging around
yes we’re tired of, tired of
