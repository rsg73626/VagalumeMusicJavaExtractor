GIVE ME A REASON

Give me a reason
Give me a sign
Try to persuade me to make up my mind
Makes my eyes open and make me feel wanted
Give me a reason so I'll change my mind

Give me the keys to lift up the latch
So I can climb in and light up the match
And find where it lives and jump on its back
And then all this baggage you know I'll detach

Please help me now
Please help me out
My focus comes in and then it goes out
I don't want control
I just want some space
I'm finding it hard to keep with the pace

Give me a name tag
Give me a price
Give me the process
Please let me try

We'll build it together
We'll build up a house
Where problems don't enter
And lights don't go out

Give me a reason
Give me a sign
Try to persuade me to make up my mind
Makes my eyes open and make me feel wanted
Give me a reason so I'll change my mind

Why don't you give me a reason
