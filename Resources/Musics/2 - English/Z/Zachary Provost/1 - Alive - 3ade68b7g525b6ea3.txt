ALIVE

So close to letting you go now
You're so out of sight
I'm in here dying
And nothing I'm trying can make it right
Are you really an anchor in the rising tide?
I'm barely breathing
Your love is leaving me no place to hide

Make me alive
Shoot me full of life

Say goodbye
To all you ever knew
Wake up one morning
Find out you moved up the avenue
Born again
To the taste and the smell and the touch
Nobody told you
Someone could make your heart feel this much

Make you alive
Shoot you full of life

And I wish I could hold you now
And I wish you were with me somehow
Could it be that the distance between us could help us survive?

Make us alive
Shoot us full of life

Are you ready to make me alive
Shoot me full of life

Are you ready to make you alive
Shoot you full of life

Are you ready to make us alive
