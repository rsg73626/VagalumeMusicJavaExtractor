ENJOY THE DANCE

Only she reassures me
When I'm going out of my head
I could be sleeping so uneasy
I'm calling her up instead
And as I try in vain to answer
Everything asking me why
With the patience of a dancer
She listens to every sigh
And sings me this lullaby

Baby enjoy the dance
Life is a mystery
With so many clues to find
No you haven't lost your mind
Learn to enjoy the dance
One step and two steps back
Oh my little baby
Give in to maybe
Enjoy the dance

Cold cold cold is the feeling
When I don't know the way
Warm is knowing
I'm getting closer every day
Like a dancer maintain your balance
Now you're weak and now you're strong
It's in your own allowance
Of you to be right or wrong
Now that I can hear this song

Then I can enjoy the dance
Life is a mystery
With so many clues to find
No your haven't lost your mind
Learn to enjoy the dance
One step and two steps back
Oh my little baby
Give in to maybe
Enjoy the dance
