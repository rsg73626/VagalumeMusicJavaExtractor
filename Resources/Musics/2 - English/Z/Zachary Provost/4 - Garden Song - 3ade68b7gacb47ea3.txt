GARDEN SONG

Inch by inch row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Inch by inch row by row
Please bless these seeds I sow
Please keep them safe below
'Till the rain comes tumbling down

Pulling weeds picking stones
We are made of dreams and bones
Need a place to call my own
'Cause the time is close at hand

Grain for grain sun and rain
Find my way in nature's chain
Tune my body and my brain
To the music of the land

Inch by inch

Plant your rows straight and long
Season with a prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her loving care

Old crow watching from a tree
He's got his hungry eye on me
In my garden I'm as free
As that feathered thief up there
