SHE'S PRECIOUS

If they ask me why I'm happy
If they wonder why I'm smiling
If they knew the conversations
The moments we were dialing
How a feeling finds the right flow
When the fingers do the walking
We're connected in a light show
That keeps the world talking

And they tell me
She's so far away
You're crazy

I just tell them...

She's precious
Across a million oceans
Hope my love finds you resting
My precious
Across a million oceans

There's a ray of light within me
No need to analyze it
Send it out into the darkness
For you to realize it
May it shine without a warning
May it wake you in the morning
May it find you in your manger
May it keep you out of danger

And they tell me

She's preciousous

I can't wait until I see you
Can't take it any longer
With my patience getting weaker
My love is growing stronger
If all I have are my words
Let me fill them all with kisses
So the lonely boy can tell his girl
How much of her he misses

I miss you my precious
Across a million oceans
