FIRE

I will walk through the fire
If I know you're there beside me
Find my way through the fire
With your spirit there to guide me
I will walk though the fire
If I know you're there beside me
Find my way through the fire if I know

When my heart is let down
And my soul's uninspired
Will you lead me (will you lead me)
When I'm lost and uncertain
In the midst of this fire
Will you lead me (will you lead me)

When there's no love around
There's no hope to be found
Will you lead me (will you lead me)
When there's so much despair
And I don't really care
Will you lead me (will you lead me)

Everywhere I go I know
You're there with me
Even when I'm far from my home
I will never walk alone

I will walk through the fireâ€¦

When the river gets wide
And the mountains are higher
Will you lead me (will you lead me)
When I'm one leap away
From my strongest desire
Will you lead me (will you lead me)

Give my voice a new song
Keep me on solid ground
Will you lead me (will you lead me)
Though my feet may get tired
I will walk through this fire
If you lead me (if you lead me)

Ain't no burden strong enough
To bring me down
Knowing you will lift me up
Each time I fall

I will walk through the fire...
