HOW MANY TIMES

How many times will I fall in love today
So many things that I want are coming my way
these crushes abound but they only will stay for a day
So how many times will I fall in love this way

and in my life I know
there's just been one for me
someday life will show
where my next love will be
where my next true love will be

How many times before I fall in love for real
Maybe this one cause this one makes my head like a wheel
and when is this love that will make me completely be me
What makes these hazy hills hold so much mystery?

I'll look for you to break my heart if that will make me feel
No more girls to play a part, I search for something real

and in my life I know
there's just been one for me
someday life will show
where my next love will be
where my next true love will be

How many times will I fall in love today
