ONE SPIN

I used to think we all had an equal of good and bad,
but now I’m just not so sure
As of today I feel fine and know I have peace of mind
and know that that’s no so common
Some of the people I meet when they walk with their feet
don’t hold their head up so high
How can they even compete when all they feel is weak
since their mother has died

One spin is all we can ask for and make good use of
One spin towards madness or laughter just try and turn it
One spin is all we can ask for and make good use of
One spin towards madness or laughter just try and turn it

I’m not going to go through this life just trying not to feel pain
and hope the stars they come out at night
If bad times really are here i won’t give into the fear
i'll just keep singing along
When i was a little boy I would just play with my toy
instead of going outside
I wonder what I have missed maybe just using my fist or
seeing starlings fly

A game has lead to a knife it hasn’t ruined my life
it’s just made it a bit harder
I play that game when I can, because that’s just who I am
I know the price that I may pay
I weigh the good with the bad, remember all that I have, and jump right into the river
When my spin comes to an end I will not try to pretend
and say that I am ready to go
