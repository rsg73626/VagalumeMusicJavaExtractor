RUSHING BACK

Keep that smile on your lips
All you'll touch is fingertips
Try and keep some form of dignity

Hold on to this embrace
This may be your final taste
Is it payment for your past indiscretions?

I know it can be hard
when a hand might touch a leg
I know it can be hard
when her body brushes yours

But when your hands fit around her waste like they used to
don't she feel that too

and when you see in her eyes the same thing that you saw before
don't you want it more

It all is rushing back
It all comes rushing back to you

Keep this image in your mind
If you're being left behind
There will be somebody else to lust for

And though their lips won't taste the same
And you can't forget her name
And their shirt won't fit in quite the same way

But when your hands fit around her waste like they used to
don't she feel that too

and when you see in her eyes the same thing that you saw before
don't you want it more

It all is rushing back
It all comes rushing back to you
