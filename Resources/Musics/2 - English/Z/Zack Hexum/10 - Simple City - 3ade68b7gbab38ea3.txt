SIMPLE CITY

I left a glass in the sun
and ever since then
Everything has come undone
but I know I'll be

In Simple City Soon
Just Staring at the moon
Will you be there?
Can I take you there?

I saw a yen yang girl today
She was black and white
She was a pile on a chair
Pale and dark
She Wore a shirt that left her breast
For all of us to see
I want to color her and then
Maybe she'll be

In Simple City Soon
Just Staring at the moon
Will you be there?
Can I take you there?

Put me away and lose the key
if that makes it right
She and I see eye to eye
and you see that as wrong
I never meant to be the guy
Singing this song
I am the one who made love blind
but you won't let me be

In Simple City Soon
Just Staring at the moon
Will you be there?
Can I take you there?
