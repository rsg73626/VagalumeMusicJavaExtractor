THE UNKNOWN

Be still my mind
don't worry
Everything works out
if it should

if I could only see the future
There'd be no joy in life at all

it's the unknown
that drives me crazy when I'm alone
it's the unknown
that keeps me happy on my own

Can you see where I'm going?
cause I can't
The rocks I stand on, are they real?
no they're not

if I could only see the future
There'd be no joy in life at all

it's the unknown
that drives me crazy when I'm alone
it's the unknown
that keeps me happy on my own
