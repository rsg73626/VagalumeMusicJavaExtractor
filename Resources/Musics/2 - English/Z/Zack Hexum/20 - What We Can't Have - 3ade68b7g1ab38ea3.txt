WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE

She only wants what she cannot have,
but if I let her know
that she can't have me
will she want me?

-I always was one of those myself
you know the greatest one
you can ever have
is the one who gets away
__________
If what you want it comes your way
will you just turn away
you might want someone who
will someday want you too
you want I come your way
will you just turn away
you might want someone who
will someday want you
____________
Maybe it's just (that) you can't open up
cause you've been hurt before
and you'd rather starve
then feel that more
_I never was one of those myself
but it's worth the risk
just to feel something
from someone
________
I refuse to believe
You don't feel this
You don't need me

I really believe
You feel this
I need you
_____________
I feel some warmth slipping out of you
it's like you know it's there
but you won't let it through
can't you see that?
-I'll do my best to draw it out of you
but this only works
if you want it too
do you see that?
