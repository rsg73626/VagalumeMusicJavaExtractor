TREAT ME BAD

Treat me bad if you want to
You know I can't stay mad at you
But if you're sad when I leave you
Do you only blame yourself? well you should

If you don't know
What you have
Who am I to say
If you think that
I'm a fool
You may be right, but that don't mean I'll stay

Everyday I play the nice one
I believe that's who I am
I could never ever hurt you
but if you make me I guess I can

If you don't know
What you have
Who am I to say
If you think that
I'm a fool
You may be right, but that don't mean I'll stay

I have something to learn from you
and not about where a heart breaks
maybe some day I can tell you
and we'll both learn from your mistakes

If you don't know
What you have
Who am I to say
If you think that
I'm a fool
You may be right, but that don't mean I'll stay
