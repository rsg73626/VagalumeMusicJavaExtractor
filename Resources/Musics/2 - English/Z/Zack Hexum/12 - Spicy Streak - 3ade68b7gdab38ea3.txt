SPICY STREAK

When first I saw you
Things, they came unglued
I imagined angels flying by
with their tiny harps they played up high
but the devil on the other side
was the part you couldn't hide

it's alright, I see it, I know you, I need you
it's alright, the devil is in me too

It's the spicy streak that makes me want you
and the sugar sweet that keeps me here
It's the spicy streak that makes me want you
so whatever comes you know I'm here

Some times you are out of your mind
doesn't make me wonder if you should still be mine
Just save a little something sweet for me
and the happy ending's what will be

It's the spicy streak that makes me want you
and the sugar sweet that keeps me here
It's the spicy streak that makes me want you
so whatever comes you know I'm here

No one ever loved me better then you
If we can't predict the weather, than good

It's the spicy streak that makes me want you
and the sugar sweet that keeps me here
It's the spicy streak that makes me want you
so whatever comes you know I'm here
