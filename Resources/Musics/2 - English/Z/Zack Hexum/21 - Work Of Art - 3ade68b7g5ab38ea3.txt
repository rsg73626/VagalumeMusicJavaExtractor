WORK OF ART

In a sense she is just lines
Lines and flowing arcs to a point
that make a shape that I can't speak of

I have never seen such light
If you put a fire in a her eyes
It wouldn't burn any brighter

and her charm is more than that
a voice that's angled darker than color
and sparkles her other charms

What a mystery is this
A face I'll never kiss anyway
but if you'd ask me it seems real still

her eyes never look away
Follow me into my sleep
in dreamland they're closer

and her charm is more than that
a voice that's angled darker than color
and sparkles her other charms

She is a work of art
and she moves, yeah she moves right through me
She is a work of art
and she's only real in my mind
in my mind
