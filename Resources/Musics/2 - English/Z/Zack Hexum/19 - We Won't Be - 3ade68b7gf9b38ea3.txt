WE WON'T BE

Say goodbye, let's get it over
shoot the gun behind the horse

you and I too, much to cover
we ran out of bricks to build and throw

you're no devil
I'm not angel
heaven is just out of reach

just stop crying I'll keep on walking
cause the next door to the heart makes me weak

if I see you in a hundred years and you still live love me
I will try, I will try again
though I know we won't be

I'm no devil
you're no angel
heaven is just out of reach

just stop crying I'll keep on walking
cause the next door to the heart makes me weak
