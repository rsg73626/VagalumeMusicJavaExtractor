SWIM

Somedays it seems that they are all out to get you
Or does that just make it easier to take?

If everyone's standing in your way
at least you have someone to blame

Sitting around waiting for something to happen
Never suited me anyway

now I'll swim
I know I'm gonna get there
now I'll swim towards something that is better than I am
now I'll swim
for all I know I am there
now I'll swim towards something that is better than I am

Looking at the sun bleached beaches
Nothing could mean more than this

Still a wave can knock you over
and turn your view point upside down

Looking up from in the water
It still is beautiful to me

now I'll swim
I know I'm gonna get there
now I'll swim towards something that is better than I am
now I'll swim
for all I know I am there
now I'll swim towards something that is better than I am


we breathe
we see a wall
we turn
the earth
will spin without us
so keep on
keep on

now I'll swim
I know I'm gonna get there
now I'll swim towards something that is better than I am
now I'll swim
for all I know I am there
now I'll swim towards something that is better than I am
