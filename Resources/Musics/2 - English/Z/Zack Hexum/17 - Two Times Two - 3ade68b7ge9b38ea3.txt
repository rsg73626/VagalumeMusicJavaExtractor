TWO TIMES TWO

Two times two, times two
I'm stewing over me and you to me
it all seems useless

history's just that
and it always is now

what good can you do me from 24 months and 38 states
loving you is a trip to hell or the closest I'll get to the pearly gates I don't know

so for now I'll wonder
and I'll wander where I go

two times two times two
an offering from me to you would be
less than selfless

history's just that
and it always is now

what good can you do me from 24 months and 38 states
loving you is a trip to hell or the closest I'll get to the pearly gates I don't know

so for now I'll wonder
and I'll wander where I go

you and me are through
but i'm still in like with what you used to do
but now that's pointless

history's just that
and it always is now

what good can you do me from 24 months and 38 states
loving you is a trip to hell or the closest I'll get to the pearly gates I don't know

so for now I'll wonder
and I'll wander where I go
