SOME OF THE TIME

Some of the time
It must feel empty
Being alone
For so long

You know that I mean
Good things can happen
If you follow yourself
And wait for then

When all this is a memory
You're wrapped in someone's arms
Don't you ask forgive me
Just for moving on

Some of the time
you must start over
though you'll carry along
the good and the bad

You know that I mean
she's always with you
If you follow yourself
She'll come along

When all this is a memory
You're wrapped in someone's arms
Don't you ask forgive me
Just for moving on

Some of the time
Some of the time
We'll say goodbye

Some of the time
We are all with you
And though you feel alone
We're all there too

You know that I mean
I'm scared to be there
but if I follow myself
I'll make it too

When all this is a memory
You're wrapped in someone's arms
Don't you ask forgive me
Just for moving on

Some of the time
Some of the time
We'll say goodbye
