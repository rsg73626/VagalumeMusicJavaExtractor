WE WILL OR WE WON'T

Either we will or we won't be together
What I decide, as of right now, doesn't matter at all
Either I am or I'm not doing better
Whether I am, I know, it's been a slippery fall

Written words remind me what we started to have
and I won't burn a picture just to keep from going mad

I can't help feeling this way
I think that you're closer but you're drifting away
I can't help feeling this way
Each kiss that I see it turns me over, over
I can't help feeling this way
I wish you were closer but you're drifting away
I can't help feeling this way

Maybe this song is throwing a rock in the ocean
Do you think I could a build a bridge this way
It's been a long time, but I still imagine
What'd it be like to hold the small of your back at the start of the day

I can't help feeling this way
I think that you're closer but you're drifting away
I can't help feeling this way
Each kiss that I see it turns me over, over
I can't help feeling this way
I wish you were closer but you're drifting away
I can't help feeling this way
