LONG DISTANCE

You can only push away at me for so long
before I get the clue
I only wonder why we waited
if just to say adieu

Your letters used to end love always
but now just always will do
I guess the answer to my question
distance is stronger than youth

You kept us together so well
but now that I try it's farewell
I kept us apart for so long
but I still won't say that was wrong

We had a chance to be the first ones
to survive miles apart
but now that distance is ending
you'd rather stay apart

I still love you in my own way
although I don't think I should
I'll put a wall between us
if that will make it good

You kept us together so well
but now that I try it's farewell
I kept us apart for so long
but I still won't say that was wrong

Maybe I don't need you, but I miss you anyway
I guess we never got around to taking pictures that day
It seems a shame there's nothing to hold to, we never got our fair shake
cause the long distance kept us away
