OUTSIDE OPINION

when will I get over the idea
that everyone has to love me
you know I don't love everyone myself
so why should all the world treat me differently

it's nothing new I know you've felt it
still this rings true I'm nothing if not

just a servant to an outside opinion
I can't tell you what you think doesn't matter to me
why can't I just be an island on the ocean
I need something from the outside for the inside of me

somedays I feel I can take the world
and put it on my shoulders for all eternity
but even in this lack of gravity
I still need someone to just to stand there with me

it's nothing new I know you've felt it
still this rings true I'm nothing if not

just a servant to an outside opinion
I can't tell you what you think doesn't matter to me
why can't I just be an island on the ocean
I need something from the outside for the inside of me

just a servant to an outside opinion
