REALISTIC FANTASY

I have so much to say to you
I wanna share a little piece of my mind
I have so much to give to you
but you don't seem to have the time

that's just fine with me
there are other shows to see

Just once could I not be disappointed
could I meet someone that's twice what I hoped they would be
Just once could I not be disappointed
could you stack up to my realistic fantasy
my realistic fantasy

you are so sweet I nearly lost my teeth
when our lips touched only one time
I was dreaming of a sunny street
the fence was broken it was mine

that's just fine with me
there are other shows to see

Just once could I not be disappointed
could I meet someone that's twice what I hoped they would be
Just once could I not be disappointed
could you stack up to my realistic fantasy
my realistic fantasy

This coloring book has no lines
this mystery has no clues
there is a washing machine in my mind
but it's not cleaning you
me and you

this is over but in my head
I want to tell you off once and for all
I was thinking maybe instead
I'd be happy to be strung along

that's no way to be
there are other shows to see

Just once could I not be disappointed
could I meet someone that's twice what I hoped they would be
I'd do backflips for your reciprocity
and if you stack up to my realistic fantasy
my realistic fantasy
