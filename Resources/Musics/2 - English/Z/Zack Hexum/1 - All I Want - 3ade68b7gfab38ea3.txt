ALL I WANT

Put your fingers to your lips
you make me think of something
I can't say
it's been a long to feel this
you made me dream of something
I won't say

Why are you all I want
I didn't ask for this
Somehow you're all that I know
now I know this is bliss

Have I been waiting to feel this
Only since forever
I won't stay alone
Are you waiting to show me
brighter weather
or am I wrong again

Why are you all I want
I didn't ask for this
somehow you're all that I know
now I know this is bliss
why are you all that I need
I didn't ask for this
looking for you mind to read
now all I need is some bliss

tell me
tell me why

Why are you all I want
I didn't ask for this
somehow you're all that I know
now I know this is bliss
why are you all that I need
I didn't ask for this
looking for you mind to read
now all I need is some bliss
