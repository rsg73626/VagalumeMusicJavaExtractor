SUN STILL SHINES

Sun still shines on me
You won't let me be
People come and go
still one left to know

I'm free now, but hung up
Left to dry, not strung out
If I have one learned thing
Your mind is not to blame

I'm free now, but hung up
Left to dry, not strung out
If I have one learned thing
Your body is to blame

I can't be untrue
If face to face with you
You were loved more than I knew
Joni speaks the truth

I'm free now, but hung up
Left to dry, not strung out
If I have one learned thing
Your mind is not to blame

I'm free now, but hung up
Left to dry, not strung out
If I have one learned thing
Your body is to blame

Blink and you won't see
The truth and what will be
There was always someone else
Never better than yourself

I'm free now, but hung up
Left to dry, not strung out
If I have one learned thing
Your mind is not to blame

I'm free now, but hung up
Left to dry, not strung out
If I have one learned thing
Your body is to blame
