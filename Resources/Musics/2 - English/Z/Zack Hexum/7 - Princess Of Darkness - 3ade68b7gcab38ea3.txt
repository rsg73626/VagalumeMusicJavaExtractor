PRINCESS OF DARKNESS

There was always something strange about you
and now I know
You are happy in the darkest of places,
but never just for show

Never the kind to be lost in a moment
if the moment was kind to you
Never the kind to be glad to be happy
but somehow happy when you're feeling blue

Princess of darkness
whatever will become of you
Princess of darkness
if you think it than it makes it true

You were waiting for this song about you
and your verdict was long ago
Here's your wish, we both knew this would happen
it can't come as a blow

Never the kind to be lost in a moment
if the moment was kind to you
Never the kind to be glad to be happy
but somehow happy when you're feeling blue

Princess of darkness
whatever will become of you
Princess of darkness
if you think it than it makes it true

There was always something strange about you
and now I know

Princess of darkness
whatever will become of you
Princess of darkness
if you think it than it makes it true
