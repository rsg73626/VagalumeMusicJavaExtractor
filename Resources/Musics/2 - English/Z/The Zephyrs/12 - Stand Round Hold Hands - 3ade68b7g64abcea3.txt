STAND ROUND HOLD HANDS

The last tear that you cried
Was your last wave goodbye
The first arc of the sun
Appeared in the sky
To light up the room
And all who stand round
Holding your hand

She gave you a flower
To plant before dawn
And gave us this house
With a wild green lawn
The longer it's been
The deeper it goes
No one can live
On this much sleep

If I let you in, you'll ruin my day
If I let you out, you'll look back and see
That I'm tired beyond belief
And I'm scared to fall asleep
I thought that I lay awake in my room
Until I woke it slowly seeped in
She beats on my chest, I've been here before
I thought that I heard feet in the hall
