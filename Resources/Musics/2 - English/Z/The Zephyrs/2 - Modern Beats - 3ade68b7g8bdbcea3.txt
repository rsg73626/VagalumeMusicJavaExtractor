MODERN BEATS

I saw the north star shining
From the airport bar
Here the tape deck hissing
When I press the rewind

I felt the ocean rising
Along the harbour wall
Hear the big storm blewing
Some older moment

I saw the north star shining
From the airport bar
Hear the tape deck hissing
When I press the rewind
