WATERCOLOUR

I might have unleashed
A storm from your eyes
That tears through the skies
The weather is black
It came like a flood
From the oceans above
The summer has all but gone for this year

I was led to believe
The mountain stands still
A tear from the sky
The weather is black
It's a life giving force
We must keep at bay
As long as the colour of water is grey
