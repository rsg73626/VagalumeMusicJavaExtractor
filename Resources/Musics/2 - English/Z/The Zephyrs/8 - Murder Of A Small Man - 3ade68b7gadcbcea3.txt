MURDER OF A SMALL MAN

Meet me in the old house
When the concrete is colder
Linoleum is peiling from the floor
Split the deck and take the card
The jokers have been taken out
The kings and queens are laughing at the name of hearts

Hold my teeth, don't breath in or fan me
Small stones grow large in soil and sand

Hold my teeth, don't breath in or fan me
Small stones grow large in soil and sand
