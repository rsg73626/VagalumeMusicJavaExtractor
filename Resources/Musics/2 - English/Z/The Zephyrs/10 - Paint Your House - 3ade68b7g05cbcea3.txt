PAINT YOUR HOUSE

If you only gave me half the paint
That I need to paint your house
I'll only paint half your house

And then all of your fears
Shall truly come upon you
The rain lies in the atmosphere

Ruin all the walls
And die on all their floors
Raining in the silent days
Waste the paint

The floods closed the house
All over the town
We argued and then I walked out

When the sky comes down
It comes down on your head
And even if the sun lit days
Waste the paint
