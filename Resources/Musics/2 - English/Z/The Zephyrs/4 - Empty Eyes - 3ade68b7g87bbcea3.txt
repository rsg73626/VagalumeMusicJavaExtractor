EMPTY EYES

You looked through
My empty eyes
And gazed upon those unspoken lies
I have seen
The ruthless machine
Cut right through all that you and I have been

You moved to
An unfurnished room
I didn't think you would move away so soon
I give thanks
For our dreams
They bring back home all that you and I have been

You looked through my empty eyes
