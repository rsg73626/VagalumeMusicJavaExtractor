DANCING SHOES

She danced in your black shoes
She danced with you
When violence is the answer
Pain's the only outcome
And every cut is wet
In the blood you let

I heard them whisper that maybe i would die

And every twist of steel
Caressed the way i feel

I heard them whisper that maybe i would die
