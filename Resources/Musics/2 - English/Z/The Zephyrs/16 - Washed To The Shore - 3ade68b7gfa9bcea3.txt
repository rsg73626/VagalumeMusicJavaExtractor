WASHED TO THE SHORE

I am a husk
My insides have fallen out
They lay to decay
I am a shell
I used to live in the sea
But I've since passed away

I'll be washed to the shore
Good friends don't always know more
I want to live by the sea
Wash the silt from my shell

I owned a house
It was all that I worked toward
For the past three decades
You blessed the sand
That the four walls were built upon
In a well sheltered bay

I'll be carried away
It's been a year to the day
I want to live by the sea
Wash the silt from my shell
