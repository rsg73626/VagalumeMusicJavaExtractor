ONE YEAR MANY MISTAKES

I made the first mistake that winter makes
I bought the wrong coat
In autumn Santa wears a green cloak
In winter he wears red

I never thought that tea would stain my cup
As much as coffee could
A storm of torn white Christmas cards
The blanket on our bed

I made the first mistake that summer makes
I bought the wrong sized shoes
The autumn fires and winter sun
I wished they would return
