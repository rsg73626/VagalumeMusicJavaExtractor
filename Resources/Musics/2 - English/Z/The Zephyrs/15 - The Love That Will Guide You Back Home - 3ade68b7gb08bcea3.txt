THE LOVE THAT WILL GUIDE YOU BACK HOME

I was oh so nearly tempted into your bed
It'd all gone so far, the idea had run through your head
But I came back home anyway, the next day
The dew was still fresh on my shoes that lay by the door
As I lay down flat in the hall and whispered to you
That I'm not going to lie anymore

As we talked I grew old, this is not where I thought we would be
To pay back in kind what I owe will cost all I own
So please don't cry anymore
For the love that will guide you back home

I was oh so nearly tempted into your bed
