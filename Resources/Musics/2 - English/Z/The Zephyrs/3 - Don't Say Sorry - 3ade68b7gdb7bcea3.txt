DON'T SAY SORRY

I've a feeling you're not coming back
As you ran down the hall (and out the flat that we shared for a year)
Just say you've been tempted down south
But don't say (sorry)

If the wild winds won't speak your name
In the pouring rain (you ran off so fast)
You'll keep for a month at the most
But don't stay (lonely)

Don't say sorry
Don't say sorry
