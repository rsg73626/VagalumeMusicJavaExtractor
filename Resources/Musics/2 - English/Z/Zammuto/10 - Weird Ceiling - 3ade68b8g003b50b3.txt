WEIRD CEILING

Shame, shame knows my name
Shame, shame knows my maiden christian name

Do they smile down upon me everytime
I feel embarasement while walking
On the wide horizons
And do they hurt or die

For everytime I hate myself
And who I am while walking
On the wide horizons
Will they be satisfied when

I come back and memorize the pointing people
Walking on the wide horizons
Shame
Faces up to the weird ceiling
Faces up to the weird ceiling
