THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME

Sit down, turn around
Shape shift when you're tongue tied
I'm so tongue tied
Put the movies on, don't care what I see
Just a situation, a saturation
And I'll be saturated, until the low comes

Thought about it for a long time
Took a hurricane to make up my mind
That I gotta go
It's a foolish game, ain't no reason for
A trite little concept, a fabrication
I need it anyway
Because it's the shape of things to come

Sat down, closed eyes
Took a deep breath, under a big sky
I was eviscerated, it pulled my guts out
Turn the movies off, there's enough to see
We all want the same things for our family
And I'll be agitated, 'til I cross the mississippi
