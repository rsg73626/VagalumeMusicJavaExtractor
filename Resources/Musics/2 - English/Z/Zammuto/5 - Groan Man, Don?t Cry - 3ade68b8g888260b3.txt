GROAN MAN, DON?T CRY

Groan man says I don't have to work no more
But given all his privileges, groan man wouldn't know
It's all good, it's alright, crisis solved, but it's revolting
To watch you complaining at the lake
The smallest little violin stuck in your eye
It makes you cry
Rivers made of fake

Groan man, don't cry
Groan man, don't cry
When you're on your own, leave the past behind
When you walk alone, relax, unwind

Joseph says I don't have to hold my head now
But given all his privileges, groan man wouldn't know
It's all good, it's alright, crisis solved, but it's revolting
To watch you complaining at the lake
The smallest little violin stuck in your eye

Groan man, don't cry
Groan man, don't cry
When you're on your own, leave the past behind
When you walk alone, relax, unwind
