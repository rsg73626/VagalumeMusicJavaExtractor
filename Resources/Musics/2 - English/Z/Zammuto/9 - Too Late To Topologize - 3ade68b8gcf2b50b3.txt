TOO LATE TO TOPOLOGIZE

Cross sea harping on the paragon
Screams daliance
Chrome skies, she'll only pulverize
Your poor collar. Suh!

Wooh-hoo, you're an audiophile
Wooh-hoo, you can change on dime, yeah

Float around solo
Crawled ashore to check you out
Soon we'll have our own little monkey, yeah
Who'll follow you anywhere

Wooh-hoo, you're so versatile
Wooh-hoo, you're gonna thrive in dry times, yeah

Blind dog tired, you have to shut your eyes
Sleep ambulance
Chrome skies, don't have to wonder why
You're so tired. Suh!

Wooh-hoo, you're my tax return
Wooh-hoo, you're my 1099a, yeah

Free-form green horn
Born and raised to figure eight
Back and forth across the country, yeah
I'll follow you anywhere
Is it out there? Has it blended in?

Wooh-hoo, you're an audiophile
Wooh-hoo, you can change on a dime, yeah
