IDIOM WIND

We could talk all night, but talking isn't real
We could put a name on it, but it's not the real name

The perfect fault, call it what you will
It still won't last that long, cause you're headstrong
You're headstrong, sorry but you're wrong
An educated man, doing everything he can
Which isn't much, cause his education isn't worth a damn

Try getting off your ass, try picking up then ask
Things are getting overgrow, and it's time for worthless cutting
Words without sweating, "never to heaven go. "
Educated man
You're an idiom babe, twisting in the wind
Remember how you used to take the bit between your teeth

Idiom wind
And all you do is rub the surface
You're exposed when everything you need is underneath

If you grew a spine, if you lived the long time
Tragedy is bound to find you, cause you're headstrong
You're headstrong, I know you'd do it all again
Words without sweating, never to heaven go
