HARLEQUIN

Here I am again, an ordinary man
Here I am again, in isolated land
I will keep you warm
I will keep you warm
Don't know how I'll keep your stomach full next year
But I will keep you warm

A river of people's things, a river of people's things
Carried downhill in a perfect expression of gravity's endlessly sinking
Into an ocean of everything

I'm a harlequin
You're the reason for everything

I've been to hell and back
I've seen all I can take
In a complex landscape set under an impossibly beautiful bright orange sky
I took a tablespoon every day

I'm a harlequin
You're the reason for everything
