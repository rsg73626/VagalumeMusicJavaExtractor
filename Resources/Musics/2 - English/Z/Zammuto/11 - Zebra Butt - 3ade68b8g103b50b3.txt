ZEBRA BUTT

I've got it planned to the last man
While you're sitting there acting like a horse's ass, man
To the two to the three to the four on the floor in the store
Citing caveat emptor
You've got no guts to trust, rest my case, open shut
You're the last one in line, like a zebra butt
To the six to the seven to the eight to the nine, feeling great
Feeling fine, take the bait

I'm like edison, I have a vision
I don't need your permission to be a magician
And now it's never night
And I'm a mason making
Dams up in your river basin
A cool sensation flooding your foundation

I like making lakes in the hole
Where you used to be
It makes me happy
Strong like t. v. a., I let the water out a little at a time
And let it turn my little turbine
Electric air-conditioned summer
Electric air-conditioned summer

Listen to your fathers and your mothers
Some are better bets than others
Listen to your sisters and your brothers and the others
They're ahead and you're behind
So don't deny it's high time to get in line
Like a zed butt

Now you're on my list of deadbeat reactivists
Living at the back-ass end of it
You should have listened to your mother
