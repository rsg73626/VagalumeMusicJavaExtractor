F U C-3PO

Dull, proud, slow, stand where you are
Crawling through your pile
Weak, lame, rude, and vile
Where you are, where you are
Crawling through your piles
You have lost your edge
Our bags are picking up, are picking up

I would rather lose my house and all
Than have to smell your acid tone, your acid tone
Alone, inane, grey, confused, where you are
Crawling through your pile
Stuck, obtuse, cynical, afraid

Stick your head above the wall you are
The wall you are
Crawling through your piles
You have lost your edge
I'll pick it up, I'll pick it up
