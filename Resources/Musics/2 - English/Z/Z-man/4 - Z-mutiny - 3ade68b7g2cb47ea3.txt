Z-MUTINY

[Z-Man]
I don't think so rellie
z-dazzle, goin' mutiny
dont y'all get in his way
whassup man
he's lethal, bustin through people
get the fuck up out of his way

[Z-Man]
give me that motherfuckin black n mild
so I can break it in half
and shove it up your ass
with a genuine draft
and ride off on a giraffe
till its legs is broke
sit alongside of the bay and watch those legs float
wit' a message in a bottle but instead its a rap
you tryna battle?
recieve this one and float me one back
you thinkin too slow, you got peanut butter for brains
my brain look like terrain wit' airplane stains and it don't stop
'til my veins poesy strange
I'm always in your pockets, my name is spare change
no tattoos, my skin is too, pretty for that shit
my permanent paint job and california accent is catchy
the flow is like jumpin onboard
there ain't enough o's in smooth to describe the art
a frisco vet, please don't give me an acapela
i'll explode like a seagull that swallowed and alka-seltzer
and touch anything beauty queen, I might behave
you can stick your newborn inside the microwave
Cause I'm afraid it might grow up to be the shit
and right now, I'm satellite and I refuse to quit

[Z-Man - chorus]
z-dazzle goin' mutiny
dont y'all get in his way
you know I'm sayin
he's lethal bustin through people
get the fuck up out of his way
whassup man

[Z-Man]
never tuckin' chains, duckin' flames
go ahead and bust, your freestyle sucks
I ain't buyin' you lunch plus
me and - the only project cats you kick it with
yea you are what you eat and you eatin chicken shit
call me the last letter (last letter) full of anthrax
relaxed on a bed of thumbtacks
here to catch these halos
fallin outa heaven I'm collectin by the box though
cut the circle and then stretch 'em, errrie
sharpen up the edges and sell 'em as horns
to anybody rappin, so the cycle goes on
I'm in your project, pissin on your bellbottoms
helss got 'em 20 below, in the chokehold
- - -, don't you tell on em, memorize your freestyle trick
I need a new drug to help me forget you exist
you was crooked as I and I'm fly, I might fall out the sky
and so high, full on heron, I might just die
keepin it natural, pushin sheep, wine out the pisshole
and never do a show wit'out a bottle of cisco
catch me, I'm mutiny
lookin serious writing these lyrics
about rappers and dead bodies, I'm holdin they spirits
waitin on payment

[Z-Man - chorus]

[Z-Man]
hangin the wax, relaxin is not on the agenda
you can tell what the eat jack its on the antenna
not even trippin, you do a lot of squashin and squishin
the ghost of every roach still haunts your kitchen
ooh shit, shoulda been on lyricist lounge
but no, you cats is stuck in the tree afraid to get down wit' z
scrapin' off your makeup bro
you don't need caffine, I'm the wakeup show
without the sways and the techs, I'm respected on beats
I used to be stiff on a beat now I'm sick on a beat
recording at elon's, call it the 12th planet
moss laced the track and I'm z-dazzle god damnit

[Z-Man - chorus]
