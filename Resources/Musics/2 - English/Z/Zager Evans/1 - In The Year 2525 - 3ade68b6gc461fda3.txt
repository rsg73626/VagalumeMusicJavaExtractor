IN THE YEAR 2525

in the year 2525
if man is still alive
if woman can survive
they may find...

in the year 3535
ain't gonna need to tell the truth tell no lies
everything you think do and say
is in the pill you took today

in the year 4545
ain't gonna need your teeth won't need your eyes
you won't find a thing to chew
nobody's gonna look at you

in the year 5555
your arms are hanging limp at your sides
your legs got nothing to do
some machines doing that for you

in the year 6565
ain't gonna need no husband won't need no wife
you'll pick your son pick your daughter too
from the bottom of a long glass tube

in the year 7510
if God's a-comin' he ought to make it by then
maybe he'll look around himself and say
"guess it's time for the Judgement Day''

in the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty head
he'll either say "I'm pleased where man has been''
or tear it down and start again

in the year 9595
I'm kinda wondering if man's gonna be alive
he's taken everything this old earth can give
and he ain't put back nothing...

now it's been 10,000 years
man has cried a billion tears
for what he never knew
now man's reign is through

but through the eternal night
the twinkling of starlight
so very far away
maybe it's only yesterday...

in the year 2525
if man is still alive
if woman can survive
they may find...

in the year 3535
ain't gonna need to tell the truth tell no lies
everything you think do or say
is in the pill you took today
