BABYLON

I saw the sky wide open 
and a white horse carries the one. 
He was the angle of judgement, 
he was faithful and strong. 
He was the annihilator, 
the chosen one. 
He was the one who'll bring the end 
to Babylon. 

CHORUS: 
Fall fall Babylon ! 
Fall fall Bybylon ! 
Fall fall Bybylon ! 

Blood and death behind him, 
his way is lined with red. 
Only children of God 
shant be put to death. 
False prophets and sinners 
are butched down by him. 
He is going to kill 'em all 
and every sin. 

CHORUS: 
Fall fall Babylon ! 
Fall fall Bybylon ! 
Fall fall Bybylon ! 

Fall fall Bybylon ! 
Fall fall Bybylon !
