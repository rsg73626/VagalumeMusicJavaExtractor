ALMIGHTY SEA

All rights and freedom 
are overcomed on here. 
One battle is stroken 
and it seems the next is near. 
The one and the only instinct 
is to survive 
The fight against the nature 
often paid with human lifes. 

On the almighty sea, 
on the almighty sea, 
on the almighty sea. 

I lead a vicious crew 
across the sea. 
We thought we are forever free. 
We despise the word of God, 
we won't adore, 
if hell or heaven - we ignore. 

On the almighty sea., 
on the almighty sea 

We thought we don't need this help, 
we thought we'd do it on our own, 
but soon we wished we'd never born. 
We became a lawless crew 
with the banner that ya know: 
Black skull crossed bones under 

On the almighty sea, 
on the almighty sea 

CHORUS: 
Is this my destiny, 
is this what I've to be. 
I can't break free 
'cause I'm a creature of the sea. 
There is only one way 
and nowhere else to go, 
the only exit is to die. 

Soon we got our punishment, 
't was thrashed down by the Lord. 
Storm and thunder were sent, 
our fate is now to fight 
against the mighty sea. 
Only if we die we're forever free. 

On the almighty sea, 
on the almighty sea. 

CHORUS: 
This is my destiny 
and this's what I've to be. 
I can't break free 
'cause I'm a creature of the sea. 
There's only one way 
and nowhere else to go. 
The only exit is to die... 

on the almighty sea, 
almighty sea 
almighty sea 
almighty sea.
