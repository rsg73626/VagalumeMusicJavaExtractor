NEVER BORN

We've been together 
for such an endless time. 
Whe I first met you 
I had to make you mine. 
We fell in love, 
our stars flew into sky, 
Been havin' fun, 
it had only just begun. 
We shared a dream 
that never would come true 
until I noticed, my life depends on you. 
You broke my heart, 
what else am I to do 
than let you do 
whatever you want to. 

CHORUS: 
How much I try to forget, 
whatever I do turns me back 
to my memories. 
Since the day I thrashed your love 
I know that there's no chance for us - 
and it's me to blame. 

When you leave me, 
it's gonna be for good. 
Veber returning to me 
although you should. 
My cries are helpless, 
I know you can't come back. 
Inspite of this 
I'm longing  for your kiss. 

Every night I'm thinkin' of your love. 
It drives me crazy, 
I'm missin' you so much. 
To be honest - 
someties I'm glad you've gone. 
To tell the truth - 
I know that you were wrong. 

CHORUS: 
How much I try to forget, 
whatever I do turns me back 
to my memories. 
Since the day I thrashed your love 
I know that there's no chance for us - 
and it's me to blame. 

Now it's over 
and  nothing more to heal. 
In dreams you're back, 
but it can't be real. 
You can't forgive me, 
I've done a lot of things. 
You can't forget 
so it's my turn to accept, 
that you can't love me 
the way you did before. 
Your trust in me 
is gone forever more. 
I cry for help 
but I am on my own. 
Sometimes I wish 
I was never born.
