ROAD BACK HOME

i look around i see that time ain't changed
same old faces, same old names
all the things we thought we knew
you lied to me & i lied to you
(now) all this time
you never sympathize
all this time
i can't find my way back inside
what you give is what you get
but you drew the line on me baby
tears falling free but you can't see (child)
i'm just a touch away baby

[chorus]
tell me where am i now (oh-o)
why, where & how
show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
tell me where am i now (oh-o)
why, where & how
show me the road back home, back home

the pain blew in like a hurricane
stranger in this town bearing your name
trapped in the silence with my memories
it's cutting me deep & its tellin' me

all this time
you never sympathize
all this time
i can't find my way back inside

going nowhere & i'm headed there fast & i
don't mean maybe
the light is getting low & my touch is growing cold
oh just hold me baby

tell me where am i now (oh-o)
why, where & how
show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
tell me where am i now (oh-o)
why, where & how
show me the road back home, back home

[guitar solo]

what you give is what you get
but you drew the line on me baby
tears falling free but you can't see (child)
i'm just a touch away baby

tell me where am i now (oh-o)
why, where & how
show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
tell me where am i now (oh-o)
why, where & how
show me the road back home, back home
