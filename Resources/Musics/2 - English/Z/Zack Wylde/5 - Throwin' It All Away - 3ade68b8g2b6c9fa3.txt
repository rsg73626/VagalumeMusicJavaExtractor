THROWIN' IT ALL AWAY

you couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face
your little world
a little out of place
you couldn't hear the ocean
you couldn't hear the waves
i know you meant to come back
i know you meant to stay

all you touched
all you know
all you loved - yeh

well i can see you smile
can you see my tears?
i reach to hold you
but you ain't there
you left a hole so big lord, beyond repair
i'll try to find forgiveness in talkin' what
will never share

all you touched
all you know
all you loved
you just left 'em with nothing to say

[chorus]
you're just throwin' it all away
no you didn't care to see the light of day
you're just throwin' it all away
like the sand upon the beach
your crashing waves came took you away
