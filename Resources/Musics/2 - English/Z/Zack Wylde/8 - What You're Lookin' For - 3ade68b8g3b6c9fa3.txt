WHAT YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR

we were friends
yet never all that close
two different people lord
i guess yeah, i suppose
well i could see by the lines on your face
so much on your mind
searchin' for someone, anyone, something to treat you kind

[chorus]
i hope you found what you were lookin' for
'cause i haven't seen your face around here no more
when did life become a chore
when was it that you couldn't take it anymore
with nothin' above you & nothin' below
couldn't cure the need for somewhere else to go
i just hope ya found what you were lookin' for

sweep all your fears
beneath the rug there on the flour
shed a new skin
no longer insecure
your livin' harder yeh
harder than you know
tell me - how fast can ya burn?
and how far can ya go?
