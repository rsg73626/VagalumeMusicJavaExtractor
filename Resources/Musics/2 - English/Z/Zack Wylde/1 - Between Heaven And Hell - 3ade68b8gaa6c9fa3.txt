BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL

dying to live
living to die
ain't no hellos here
nothing but goodbye
it's like singing a song that cannot be sung
it's like having to end child,
what's yet to love begun

[chorus]

hey, hey, hey now
where i am at times i just can't tell
hey, hey, hey, now
i'm lost somewhere between heaven and hell

all that you know and all that you knew
in the end child,
tell me what's it all mean to you?
don't forget just who and where you are --
you can spread your wings son
but don't you spread yourself too far

hey, hey, hey now
where i am at times i just can't tell
hey, hey, hey, now
i'm lost somewhere between heaven and hell
