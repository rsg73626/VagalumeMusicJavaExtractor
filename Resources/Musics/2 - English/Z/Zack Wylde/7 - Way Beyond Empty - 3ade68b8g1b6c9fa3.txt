WAY BEYOND EMPTY

if i could i surely would
child ease your pain
but if i could no longer
would you still know my name?

if i couldn't drain the tears
that pour from these eyes
would you turn your back on me
would you wave goodbye?

[chorus]
or leave me way beyond empty inside
awaiting my last day to arive
way beyond empty inside
awaiting my end to arrive

if i could be the shoulder
which your head would rest upon
would you still be waiting (mama)
or would you be gone?
if i couldn't keep the smile
forever on your face
would i still be around
or would i be replaced?

(yeah)
way beyond empty inside
awaiting my last day to arive (yeah)
way beyond empty inside
awaiting my end to arrive

oh-o
oh-o-o-o
oh-o
oh-o-o-o

[guitar solo]

(and) would you promise me
things they'd never change
could you promise me
that things they'd stay the same?

if i couldn't clear the clouds
from over your head
would you keep your word to me
amongst all the things you said?

or leave me way beyond empty inside
awaiting my last day to arive (yeah)
way beyond empty inside
(oh-o-o)
awaiting my end to arrive
oh yeah child!
