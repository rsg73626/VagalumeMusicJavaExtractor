TOO NUMB TO CRY

i see you across the room
search for some happiness ain't anytime soon
turmoil has turned you inside
sift through your pages of miracles you wish to find

[chorus]
when you're too numb to cry
& you're just left wondering why
when you're too numb to cry
& you're just left wondering why

to change in the blink of an eye
if you could you surely would wave yourself good-bye
i try & i try & i try
get a hold on your suffering
peace in which you don't wish to buy
