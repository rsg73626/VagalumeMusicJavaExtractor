SOLD MY SOUL

without you woman by my side
i'm contemplating suicide torn from all my pride
a man tells me, son that ain't the way
gonna make a deal with you child
gonna live another day
just sign right here son
everything will be alright

[chorus:]
*oooo-oh
ain't nothing i wouldn't do
*oooo-oh
all & everything for you
*oooo-oh
your love is all i know and ever knew
*oooo
therefore i have sold my soul for you
*oooo-oh
*oooo-oh

i was told by this man it would be worth my while
he'd return me to my woman
return me to my smile ----
it's all i ask for in this life
whatever's wrong son he told me he'd make right

just sign right here child
everything going to be alright

[chorus]

all for you

[solo]

just sign right here son
everything going to be alright

[chorus]

[out solo]
