I NEED YOUR LOVE

I know what you want girl
I know what you need and I'm willing to
Give anything for one more chance with you

I know what I did to you girl, I know it's
Gon be hard to forgive my sins but
If you can then let me in cuz I need your love

Well I know that you're mad at me, mad
Cuz I was not honest no I wasn't faithful
To you though you're my favorite girl and
I love you the most in the whole damn
World. Yes I know that I haven't earned
Your trust yes I know that I haven't learned
I know that I made you cry well
I'm cryin too and I'm drunk and I know not
What to do and I just cannot live like this no more
How can I be sick girl when you're my perfect cure?
Please can you
Accept my apology? I've changed in time you'll see

I know what you want girl
I know what you need and I'm willing to
Give anything for one more chance with you

I know what I did to you girl, I know it's
Gon be hard to forgive my sins but
If you can then let me in cuz I need your love

Everyday is a new day and you have the
Choice to be without the one you love or
Just get up and make known your voice
We won't be happy if we stay apart for
Too long. Are we able to admit we've done
Each other wrong?
And if sometimes you fall from grace
I'll be here waiting to give you space
some space to see that it's not fun alone in the sun

I know what you want girl
I know what you need and I'm willing to
Give anything for one more chance with you

I know what I did to you girl, I know it's
Gon be hard to forgive my sins but
If you can then let me in cuz I need your love

I hope you can find the will to stay
I never would hurt you anyway
I hope you believe me when I say
I've really change my ways
