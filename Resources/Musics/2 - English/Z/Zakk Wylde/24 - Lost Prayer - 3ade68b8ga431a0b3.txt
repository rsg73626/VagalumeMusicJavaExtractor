LOST PRAYER

You say that you're damned
You say that your life isn't fair
What's right and what's wrong
You've got your needs and you just don't care
On and on we drift
Back to where we were before
You can welcome me in
I will not walk through that door
Oh, no, no

I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a lost prayer on stormy day
Oh, stormy day

You can carry your grudge
I've severed these ties
And I've cut you free
Keep your war to yourself
I buried what was, and my sympathy
On and on we drift
Back to where we were before
You can welcome me in
I will not walk through that door
Oh, no, no

I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a lost prayer on a stormy day
Oh, stormy day
Stormy day
Well I may be blind
But I'll find my way

I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a lost prayer on a stormy day
I may be blind but I'll find my way
Oh yeah, like a lost prayer on a stormy day
Oh, stormy day
