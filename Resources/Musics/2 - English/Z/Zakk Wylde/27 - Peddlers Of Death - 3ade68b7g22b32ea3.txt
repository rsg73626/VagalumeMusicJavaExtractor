PEDDLERS OF DEATH

Come, Take My Hand
Let Us Walk For A While
Your burden of pain
Replaced with a smile
Never So Far, Only So Close
As you melt in your false cradle below

For The Peddlers Of Death
Always Come Calling One More Time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

For The Peddlers Of Death
Always Come Calling One More Time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

So called friends
are running loose
Draining you whole
Â‘Til youÂ’re of no use
Letting go of things you need most
Son,
Early Wish
Early grave
Early ghost

For The Peddlers Of Death
Always Come Calling One More Time
Bearing promises of feeling fine
For The Peddlers Of Death
Always Come Calling One More Time
Bearing promises of feeling fine
For The Peddlers Of Death
Always Come Calling One More Time
Bearing promises of feeling fine
For The Peddlers Of Death
Always Come Calling One More Time
Bearing promises of feeling fine
