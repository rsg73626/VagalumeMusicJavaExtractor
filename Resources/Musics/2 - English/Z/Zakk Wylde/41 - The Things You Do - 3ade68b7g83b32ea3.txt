THE THINGS YOU DO

Color my world all black & blue
The hell you dish out
Comes back three-fold to you
Inside your riddled rotten core
I hope you get what you deserve
Worse & even more

Chorus
How can you do the things you do?
You make Satan look like Christ
I swear its true
How could you do the things you do?

The Rolling Stones once sang a tune
Singing words of sympathy
Yet none were sung for you
If the lord of darkness seen you comin' his way
He'd get on his knees
And look to Jesus
and start to pray
