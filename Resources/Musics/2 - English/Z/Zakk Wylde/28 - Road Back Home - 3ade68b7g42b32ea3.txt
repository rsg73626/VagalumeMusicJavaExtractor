ROAD BACK HOME

I look around I see that time ain't changed
Same old faces, Same old names
All the things we thought we knew
You lied to me & I lied to you
(Now) All this time
You never sympathize
All this time
I can't find my way back inside
What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me baby
Tears falling free but you can't see (child)
I'm just a touch away baby

Chorus
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where & how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where & how
Show me the road back home, back home

The pain blew in like a hurricane
Stranger in this town bearing your name
Trapped in the silence with my memories
It's cutting me deep & its tellin' me

All this time
You never sympathize
All this time
I can't find my way back inside

Going nowhere & I'm headed there fast & I
don't mean maybe
The light is getting low & my touch is growing cold
Oh just hold me baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where & how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where & how
Show me the road back home, back home

Guitar Solo

What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me baby
Tears falling free but you can't see (child)
I'm just a touch away baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where & how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where & how
Show me the road back home, back home
