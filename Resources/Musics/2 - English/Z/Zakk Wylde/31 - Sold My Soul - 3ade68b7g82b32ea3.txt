SOLD MY SOUL

Without you woman by my side
I'm contemplating suicide torn from all my pride
A man tells me, son that ain't the way
Gonna make a deal with you child
Gonna live another day
Just sign right here son
Everything will be alright

Chorus:
*Oooo-oh
Ain't nothing I wouldn't do
*Oooo-oh
All and everything for you
*Oooo-oh
Your love is all I know and ever knew
*Oooo
Therefore I have sold my soul for you
*Oooo-oh
*Oooo-oh

I was told by this man it would be worth my while
He'd return me to my woman
Return me to my smile
It's all I ask for in this life
Whatever's wrong son he told me he'd make right

Just sign right here child
Everything going to be alright

Chorus

All for you

Solo

Just sign right here son
Everything going to be alright


*Oo-oh
Ain't nothing I wouldn't do
*Oo-oh
All and everything for you
*Oo-oh
Your love is all I know and ever knew
*Oo
Therefore I have sold my soul for you
