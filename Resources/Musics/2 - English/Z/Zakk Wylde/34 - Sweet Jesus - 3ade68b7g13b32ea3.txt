SWEET JESUS

Talkin' down the line
I nearly lost my mind
Nearly lost you babe
Think about you child
Through my sick and twisted smile
I nearly lost you babe
Shakin' in my hands
I just don't understand
I nearly lost ya mama
Lovin' just to hate
A war that just won't wait
I nearly lost ya babe 

My eyes have gone blind
The past I just can't find
A flower to be saved
A flower for your grave
Mama at times I just don't know
Oh sweet Jesus
Where did I go? 

What it was to be
Was kinda clear to see
Nearly lost ya babe
Ain't no backin' down
Caring, Cus I ain't nobody's clown
I nearly lost you babe
Breakin' down inside
Nearly lost you babe
Forever one more time
Until the day I die
I nearly lost ya babe 

My eyes have gone blind
The past I just can't find
A flower to be saved
A flower for your grave
Mama at times I just don't know
Oh sweet Jesus
Where did I go?
