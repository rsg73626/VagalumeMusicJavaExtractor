FADIN' AWAY

Should I feel lost
Or should I feel found
What should it be?
Up or down
Won't yo please help me...
Searching high
I'm searching low
Where might it be? A loss for words
That'll set me free 

Fadin' away
Mama, it's been a year to the day 

You ask for this
They sell you that
A better place
Is where I hope you're at
Who's gonna live and who's gonna die?
Is it hello or goodbye?
Could you tell me how
Could you tell me why 

Fadin' away
Mama, it's been a year to the day 

When the daisies are growing over top of me
Where is it that I go
Running out of time
Lord, I need to know 

Fadin' away
Mama, it's been a year to the day
