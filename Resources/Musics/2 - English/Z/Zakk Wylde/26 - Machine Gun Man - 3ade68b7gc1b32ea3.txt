MACHINE GUN MAN

Tell me what a young man Mama
What's he got to live for
Tossed in the shuffle of everyday war
Searchin' for some trouble
Which I'm sure he will find
Spend your whole life fightin' son
Meet your dyin' time 

It's a shame
It's a shame
The trigger be his only friend
It's a shame, oh yeh
But it ain't never gonna end 

He's a pocketful of hate
That don't give a damn
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
Well, he ain't got no future
And he ain't got no plan
What fate awaits the machine gun man? 

I can't see tomorrow
And I don't see today
Trail of confusion done leadin' my way
They say the only thing worth killin' Lord
Be killin' time
I say the only soul worth savin' now Mama
Resavin' mine 

It's a shame
It's a shame
The trigger be his only friend
It's a shame, oh yeh
But it ain't never gonna end 

He's a pocketful of hate
That don't give a damn
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
Well, he ain't got no future
And he ain't got no plan
What fate awaits the machine gun man? 

He keeps shootin' mama
 like any old fool would do
Lord, the life he be leadin' 
ain't the one he has to choose
As he walks on out that door
Mama breaks down to cry
As she waves the machien gun man
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye...
