IN MY TIME OF DYING

Oh yeah!
Oh, in my time of dying, oh, want nobody to mourn 
All I want for you to do is take my body home 
Take it home...

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
I can die easy.

*incoherant distant talking from a very drunken Zakk*

Jesus, gonna make up my dyin' bed.
Loord, Meet me, Jesus, meet me. Oh, Meet me in the middle of the air 
If my wings should fail me, Lord. Oh, please meet me with another pair 

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Lord, Yeah!


Jesus, gonna make up.. somebody, somebody... 
Jesus gonna make up... Jesus gonna make you my dyin' bed 

Saint Peter, at the gates of heaven... Oh, Won't you just let me in 
I never did no harm. Lord...
Ohhhhh, yeah
Never did you no wrong
ooooooooo No wrong!


I've only been this young once. I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong 
No, not once. 
Lord, I musta done somebody good,
I see their smiling face.
Yeah I see your face child!

Ohhhhh.......
Oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus


Oh yeah, Oh I'm gonna make it my dyin' day,
Yup.
