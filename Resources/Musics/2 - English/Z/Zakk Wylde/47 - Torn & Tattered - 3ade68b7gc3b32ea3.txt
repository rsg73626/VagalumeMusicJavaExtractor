TORN & TATTERED

Take a listen
Child, if you can
I'll tell you a story, now
About a broken man
He done built his walls
In time they all caved in
He done lost what he loved, son
Done killed him in the end
Chorus:
Lord, I'll take it here to heaven
Feelin' like you don't belong
Lord, if life was music
Yours would be one torn and tattered song
Oh yeah.
A whole lot of hurtin', child
A whole lotta pain
If you could do it all over, son
Tell me, would it end the same?
A never ending feeling
Forever sinkin' low
I lost the light in your tunnel, child
You lost which way to go
Chorus
Solo
Chorus
Oh, yeah now
One torn and tattered song,
Hey, yeah now
Lord, one torn and tattered song now
Lord, one torn and tattered song.
