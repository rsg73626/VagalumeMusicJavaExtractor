SLEEPING DOGS

You couldn't find your peace
Within the bitterness that burns
For the sleeping dogs that lie
Forever to return, forever to return

Gone but not forgotten
You cut me down just to watch me bleed
Gone but not forgotten
I gave you the last word and that's the last thing you'll take from me

Isn't justice that you hope?
Believe in the story that you sell
For the Sleeping Dogs that lie
They are live and well, live and well

Gone but not forgotten
You cut me down just to watch me bleed
Gone but not forgotten
I gave you the last word and that's the last thing you take from me

Gone but not forgotten
You cut me down just to watch me bleed
Gone but not forgotten
I gave you the last word and that's the last thing you take from me

The last thing you take from me
The last thing you take from me
