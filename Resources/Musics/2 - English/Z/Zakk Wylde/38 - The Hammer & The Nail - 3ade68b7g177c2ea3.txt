THE HAMMER & THE NAIL

1, 2, 1, 2, 3...

I went on down, down to the river
Went on down to see what I could find
Didn't see much, whole lot of nothin'
Except for a school that be takin' on a ride

[Chorus]
Oh Lord! Oh, I should've known, babe
Oh Lord! Oh! Now I should've known, should've known, Mama, now I should've known
Thinkin' that you're hard as nails, hopin' that hammer don't fall
You're thinkin' that you're hard as nails, hopin' that hammer don't fall, baby
Talkin' bout the hammer, Whoo! the hammer and the nail

(That's right, Oh yeah, Tell ya a story)

I went on back, back to the river
I went on back, think it wasn't long.
And as I stood, and stared into the water
I just realized that I bought a dancin' song

[Chorus]

(Man)

[Solo]

You're thinkin' that you're hard as nails, hopin' that hammer don't fall, baby
You're thinkin' that you're hard as nails, hopin' that hammer don't fall
Talkin' bout the hammer, Whoo! the hammer and the nail
