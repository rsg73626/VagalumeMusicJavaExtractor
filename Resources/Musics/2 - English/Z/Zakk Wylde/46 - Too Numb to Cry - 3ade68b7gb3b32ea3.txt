TOO NUMB TO CRY

I see you across the room
Search for some happiness ain't anytime soon
Turmoil has turned you inside
Sift through your pages of miracles you wish to find

Chorus
When you're too numb to cry
& you're just left wondering why
When you're too numb to cry
& you're just left wondering why

To change in the blink of an eye
If you could you surely would wave yourself good-bye
I try & I try & I try
Get a hold on your suffering
Peace in which you don't wish to buy
