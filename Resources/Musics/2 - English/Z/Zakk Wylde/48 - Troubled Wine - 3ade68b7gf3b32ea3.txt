TROUBLED WINE

Take your time, time
Take your time
Take it Mama
Take your sweet time
Take your time
Take it baby
Gonna get to you
Don't even try
Ain't gettin' by Mama
Think ya can but ya can't
Ain't no gettin' by babe
I'm gonna get to you 

The bottom of the barrel is where I've been
And I'll always be
It's where I find reality
I ain't seein' clear no
And I don't wanna be
Just let me drown in my misery 

Wine - I'll make you mine
Serve you a glass of my troubled wine
Tell me what you is
Tell me who you is
What you be
Lord I'll be your ship
Your ship sinkin' in the sea
Just take my hand
when you hurt
When you cry
When you bleed
A little ship
A little bit's all ya need
I'm always here for you 

The bottom of the barrel is where I've been
And I'll always be
It's where I find reality
I ain't seein' clear no
And I don't wanna be
Just let me drown in my misery 

Wine - I'll make you mine
Serve you up a glass of my troubled wine
