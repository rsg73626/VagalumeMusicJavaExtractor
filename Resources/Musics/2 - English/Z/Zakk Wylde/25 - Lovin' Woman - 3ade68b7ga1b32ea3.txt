LOVIN' WOMAN

I'm kinda sick now, yeah
I'm kinda down
Truckload of trouble
Is what I found
And as I turn
To get away
Another spoken problem
Have found something to say 

Lord, I gotta find my home
I need a lovin' woman
I can call my own
I'm just tired
Mama tired of runnin' alone
I need a lovin' woman
That I can call my own 

Ain't got no time
No time to think
Search me some gold
Grab me a drink
Well I've got me a frown now
Need to find me a smile
Whether your grass is green or blue
Until I walk a mile 

Lord, I gotta find my home
I need a lovin' woman
I can call my own
I'm just tired
Mama tired of runnin' alone
I need a lovin' woman
That I can call my own
