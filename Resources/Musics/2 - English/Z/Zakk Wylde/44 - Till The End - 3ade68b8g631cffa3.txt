TILL THE END

And baby in the end
It's just you & me.

I've been broken
I have died
Almost shot baby
One more try
Roll me, roll me, roll me, roll me, roll me
Roll me through this darkness once again.
Say what you want babe
Say what you will
I'm just looking for a friend
Baby til the end
It's you & me baby til the end.
Baby, I've been down so long
You are my life
You are my sun
You & me, you & me
I can see, I can see.
Oh yeah, I can see.
I can see child?.
It's just you & me.
It's you & me baby til the end.
The thunder & the rain
Nothing's the same
Oh baby, I just can't change.
The thunder & the rain
Nothings the same
I can't change.
