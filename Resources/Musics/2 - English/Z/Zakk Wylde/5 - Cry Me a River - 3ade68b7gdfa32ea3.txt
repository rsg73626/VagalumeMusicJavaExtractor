CRY ME A RIVER

I keep on runnin' baby
I keep on runnin'
But I just can't hide
No, I just can't hide
I keep on hurtin' baby
I keep on hurtin' so deep inside
So deep inside 

Lord I need your smile
Child like the one I once knew
Made my grass green
And my blue skies blue
Lord was time when 2 was 1
Tell me now girl
Where've all the good times gone 

Cry me a river
Wash my blues all away
Cry me a river
Girl you is my riverboat
Take me away
Is reachin' out my hand
Won't ya please help me to my feet once again
Tears fallin' like rain
Lord it's a time
When everybody needs a friend
Girl where've you been 

Lord I need your smile
Child like the one I once knew
Made my grass green
And my blue skies blue
Lord was a time when 2 was 1
Where've all the good times gone 

Cry me a river
Wash my blues all away
Cry me a river
Girl you is my riverboat
Take me away
