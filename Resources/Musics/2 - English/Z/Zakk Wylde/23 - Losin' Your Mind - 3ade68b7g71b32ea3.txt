LOSIN' YOUR MIND

Woke up early this morning
As I looked around
My world be crumblin' down
What I saw
I couldn't believe
Who are you ?
What might I be ?
Oh, the things you do 

Stare at the sun
1 means 3
At the helm insanity
If you'd look Mama, ya just might find
But you're too far gone
Now you're just losin' your mind 

Wanting to get away
One more fix you'll be o.k.
The things ya do
Try and try to talk you down
You're so damn high, can't hear a sound
Oh, what's going on ? 

Once you start
You can't stop
Start to shake
Fall apart
Engine's burnin' burnin' out of time
You're too far gone
Now you're just losin' your mind 

Pass through time
Without a move
You're the one that's being used
If you'd look
You must might find
But you're too far gone
Now you're just losin' your mind
