SHINE ON

Take, take a little time
Son you can run
But there ain't nowhere you gonna hide
Now you done takin' all I done had
Paybacks be a comin'
So ya best start sayin' your prayers
Shine on
So I can find my way on back to you
Shine on
So I can shine my lovin' light on you 

Ain't never comin' back
A better set of hands is where she be at
Don't go thinkin' you ain't done nothin' wrong
I'm the judge
I'm the jury
I'm gonna put your ass where you belong


Chorus:
Shine on
So I can find my way on back to you
Shine on
So I can shine my lovin' light on you 

Take, take a little time
Son you can run
But there ain't nowhere you gonna hide
Now you done takin' all I done had
Paybacks be a comin'
So ya best start sayin' your prayers 

Chorus 

Ain't never comin' back
A better set of hands is where she be at
Don't go thinkin' you ain't done nothin' wrong
I'm the judge
I'm the jury
I'm gonna put your ass where you belong 

Chorus
