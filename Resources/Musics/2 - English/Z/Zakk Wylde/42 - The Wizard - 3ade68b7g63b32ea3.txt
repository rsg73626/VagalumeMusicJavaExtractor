THE WIZARD

Yeah!
Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by 
Casting his shadow, oh, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, lord, a tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
shiiit.

Yeeeaaaahh!
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears, yeaaah, into joy 
Everyone's happy, mama, when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Yup.

Lord, lookout!

Yeah.
The sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people, lord, to feel so fine

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Yeaaaahhh!
