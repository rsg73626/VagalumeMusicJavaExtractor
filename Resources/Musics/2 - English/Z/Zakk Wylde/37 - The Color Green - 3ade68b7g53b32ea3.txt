THE COLOR GREEN

I recall when you once said
"There's truth in both of us
And all that lies ahead."
I take it your tongue, 
It just got twisted,
Or maybe it got tired, 
Or maybe your memory waved goodbye.

When your so-called friends forget your name 
When your so-called friends, they aint the same 
When your so-called friends, they've lost thier way
And they aint what they was just the other day, hey 
Shoulda listened to what my folks, they had to say 
Just like a dog thats turned on you,
Ain't it funny what the color green will make some people do?

How I couldn't see thru your thin disguise,
Lord only knows, and such a fool was I
Happy-go-lucky thats what I was, and what I hope to be 
But I feel that I've lost that side of me 

When your so-called friends forget your name 
When your so-called friends they aint the same 
When your so-called friends they've lost thier way
And they aint what they was just the other day, hey 
Shoulda listened to what my folks, they had to say 
Just like a dog thats turned on you,
Ain't it funny what the color green will make some people do?
