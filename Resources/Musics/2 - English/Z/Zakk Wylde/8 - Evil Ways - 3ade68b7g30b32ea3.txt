EVIL WAYS

Sittin' sippin' sorrow
It's gone straight to my head
I say the pain shall come and it shall go
a friend once said

You ain't livin' for no God, no
You be livin' for the dollar sign
I say a frown upon your makers face
you shall find

So....Ooooh soo much wrong
You have tried, oh yeah

I waited far
Oooh far too long, yeah

Talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song
I'm talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song

Wanting to know nothing
Living through a child's eyes
A smile comes upon your face
as I break and cry

If nothing seems to matter
In the end what are you doin' it for
To see the trail of twisted broken souls
across the floor

So....Ooooh soo much wrong, yeah
You've done tried, oh yeah

I waited far
Lord, I waited far too long (yeah)

Talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song
I'm talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song

Ooooh so much wrong, child
You done tried, oh yeah

I waited far
Lord, I waited far too long, yeah

Talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song
I'm talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song

Yeah

Talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song
I'm talking about your Evil Ways
And with this pen this wrote this song

Oh yeah
