TOE'N THE LINE

Hey, hey, won't you get yourself out my way
Yeh, yeh, I'm living life like it's my last day
It's got me comin'
It's got me going
Which way I just don't know
Lord, oh Lord, I thank you and I love you so 

It's my obsession
It's a truckload of aggression
Come lookin' for a friend
I ask a question
You start messin' around with my head once again 

I'm just toe'n the line 

Mama don't you worry none
We're just toe'n the line 

Yeh, yeh, it's a rush running through my veins
Yeh, yeah I'm gonna drive the wife insane
It's got me comin'
It's got me going
Which way I just don't know
Lord, oh Lord, I love you and I thank you so 

It's my obsession
It's a truckload of aggression
Come lookin' for a friend
I ask a question
You start messin' around with my head once again 

I'm just toe'n the line 

A fist for your head
A fist for my cure
I'm tired of feeling weak
I'm tired of feeling small
I't gonna feel like this anymore 

I'm just toe'n the line 

Afterthought 

Got me a fistful of creation
Ain't nothin' Mama I can't do
Build me your walls I'm gonna break on through
Won't ya tell me, won't ya tell me
Who I am and who I can't be
Well the loser be you
Cus I know it ain't me
