WHAT YOU'RE LOOK'N FOR

We were friends
Yet never all that close
Two different people lord
I guess yeah, I suppose
Well I could see by the lines on your face
So much on your mind
Searchin' for someone, anyone, something to treat you kind 

(Chorus)
I hope you found what you were lookin' for
'Cause I haven't seen your face around here no more
When did life become a chore
When was it that you couldn't take it anymore
With nothin' above you & nothin' below
Couldn't cure the need for somewhere else to go
I just hope ya found what you were lookin' for

Sweep all your fears
Beneath the rug there on the floor
Shed a new skin
No longer insecure
Your livin' harder yeh
Harder than you know
Tell me - how fast can ya burn?
And how far can ya go?
