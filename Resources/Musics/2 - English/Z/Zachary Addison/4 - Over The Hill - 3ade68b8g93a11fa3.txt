OVER THE HILL

It’s too early, in the evenin’, for me to be feeling this way, 
Judy, took my hand …….and I did not …. 
She said over the hill, and straight ahead, doves sailing in my head, 
Then I sent away, which I still regret to this very day. 

It’s so hard, to find a good woman these days, 
However, I know there’s one lying in her grave. 
I try to undo, all I don’t know, 
By doin’ drugs and writing this song. 
It ain’t easy, losin’ your love, 
Especially when you got no one to go to. 

So goodbye sunlight, hello twilight. 
I’m feelin’ alright, just a little stage fright. 

Gotta’ go, fly away. 
Gotta’ go now, gotta leave today. 

Oh shit, I’m just trying to be Jimi here, 
But I’m fallin’ short.
