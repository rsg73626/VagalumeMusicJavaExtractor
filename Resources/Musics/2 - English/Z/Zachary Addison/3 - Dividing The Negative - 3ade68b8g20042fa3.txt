DIVIDING THE NEGATIVE

I'll just have one more drink,
To help me stop thinking about you.
Last night I couldn't sleep,
What else is a poor boy supposed to do?

Driving away I realized,
My serenity lies right behind your eyes.
So last night I drank to you,
Yeah I drank until I died.

I look to the sky,
In search up above.
Trying to find this guy named Jesus.
I'm pulling away, and falling astray,
And I don't plan to return any other day.
As times goes by, my eyes do dry,
But pain still lingers deep inside.
All I need, is someone to love,
But not some guy in the clouds above, yeah.

It's kind of sad how I think..

As you lie in bed tonight,
Remember my children, remember my wife.
I left them all for the afterlife,
As selfish as it may be.
I used to feel pain every single day,
My life was shitty, what can I say?
But now I watch my children play,
From very far away.

Yeah it's true,
I regret it's everything I do,
But I still love you.
So what I do,
But I still love you.
I still love you
