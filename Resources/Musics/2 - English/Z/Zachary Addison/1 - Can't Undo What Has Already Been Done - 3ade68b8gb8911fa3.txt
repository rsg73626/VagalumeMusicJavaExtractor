CAN'T UNDO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE

Today’s the day that I wrote this song, 
Two years isn’t that long. 
Happy Birthday, Kelly. 

September 1, 2005, Saturday..are driving by. 
As we ate, at Jenny’s. 

Just wanna’ say, “Happy Birthday, 
Happy Birthday, Kelly.” 
Just wanna’ say, “Happy Birthday, 
Happy Birthday, Kelly.” 

Felt like I did something wrong, 
Causing me to sing this song, 
But hey, I’m so funny. 

So you and I, as time went, 
Lost touch, I don’t know why. 
Hopefully now you can look me in the eye. 

Know how your mother made me feel blue, 
I hope happiness has found you. 
Happy Birthday Kelly. 

Just wanna’ say, “Happy Birthday, 
Happy Birthday my Kelly.” 

Wow!
