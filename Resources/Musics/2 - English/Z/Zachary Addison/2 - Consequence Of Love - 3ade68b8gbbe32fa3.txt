CONSEQUENCE OF LOVE

Walking through to the other side,
Hoping your love will be my guiding light.
And I wait for you so patiently,
Like I was stranded, in the desolate sea.

You my love, you're the best to me,
I know sometimes it's so hard to see.
Making haze through the morning dew,
Just for me to say, I love you.

Can't you see?
That in the case of us one and one will make three.
It'll be the greatest symphony,
Our love is meant to bring peace and serenity,
Love was meant to be with you and me
