BEYOND THE THRONE

Law hangs by a thread
Hate grows when it's fed
Though blue skies overhead
The sun shines on the dead
And blight creeps up through the beds
On calm winds plague can descend
And paradise turns on its head
When brutality looms and upends
We're always but steps from that edge
Tottering steps off that ledge
You can stare off, deny and pretend
But reality snaps when you've bled

The seat of true power holds
Beyond the throne
The seed that in man corrodes
Beyond the throne
The crown of supreme control
Beyond the throne
Commands and consumes you whole
Beyond the throne

Too eager to be bossed
Too eager with no thought
Too willing to be bought
We're too willing to ease off
These are the lines that we cross
Open your eyes or you'll lose
What you've caught
Many a man who have gone where we walk
Ended up winding through
The killing fields lost

The seat of true power holds
Beyond the throne
The seed that in man corrodes
Beyond the throne
The crown of supreme control
Beyond the throne
Commands and consumes you whole
Beyond the throne

No mercy is laid
When cancer invades
When trust that you gave
Returns and betrays
This is the bed that they made
This the result when grit wanes
This the effect when nerve fades
If you lay down your sword then be slain
And I see the desire in your veins
I share the resolve you maintain
I feel the dominion you crave
But I refuse the kingdom you claim
As wars wage and lives are disposed
Beware of the frame of mind you impose
'cause I've seen the face ascendancy shows
And none can assuage the hunger that grows
Insidious as it unfolds
Drunk in a poisonous hold
This is the trade
When you take to that throne
The power commands but it's you it controls

The seat of true power holds
Beyond the throne
The seed that in man corrodes
Beyond the throne
The crown of supreme control
Beyond the throne
Commands and consumes you whole
Beyond the throne
The seat of true power holds
The seed that in man corrodes
The crown of supreme control
Commands and consumes you whole
That absolute rule forbodes
That trap that entombs the soul
Have mind to forsake what's shown
Have will to disown
Go beyond the throne

Beyond the throne

The more you feed the black hole
The more it takes to control
The more you feed the black hole
The more it takes and controls
