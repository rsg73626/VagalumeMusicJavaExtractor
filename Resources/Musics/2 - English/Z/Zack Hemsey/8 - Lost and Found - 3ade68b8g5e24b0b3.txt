LOST AND FOUND

I used to hear them say of bad news
When it rains then it pours
Fitting for a generation
Yearning out for more
A story of the ancients etched
In relics from before
Faded echoes that survive
This vicious cycle that we mourn
No telling how much pain a people can ignore
How much heartache can communities endure?
How much of the problem
Is systemic and ensured?
How much profit over people
Can executives procure?
Tension on my conscience
Feel it wrenching at the core
The walls are closing in
I need an exit to explore
When precious opportunity
Comes knocking at the door
Will you dive into the waters
Or keep standing at the shore?

Long lost but I have found
The bright of day, the here and now
The ways of old are out of view
Before I go, I'm waiting for you

This is child's play indeed
Realization of wants, hopes, and dreams
Good intentions tangled with vines
Thorns, and weeds
Racing through a thicket that blinds
Rakes, bleeds
Anxious in our slumber
We moan, beg, and plead
The cart's before the horse
But the eyes don't perceive
Monster in the flesh
That the mind won't believe
And few among us left
With the courage to come clean
I know the sigh of subsisting
Without the means
Aim that's off the mark
When you drifted by mere degrees
The hunt for explanations
And answers we all need
I've come to find the truth
Is much stranger than what it seems

Long lost but I have found
The bright of day, the here and now
The ways of old are out of view
Before I go, I'm waiting for you

Lost but not forgotten
In our struggle no stopping until it's found
Till dawn has cleared the haze
And the bright of the day surrounds
No death before dishonor
No reason for guilt to shroud
No need to check the records
My signature's in the sound
To capture that potential one seizes the pain
Conquers the doubt and remains up
Though the weight of it hangs down
You're thinking on the stage
But you're standing inside the crowd
Leap off the precipice of change
For the moment that's right now
