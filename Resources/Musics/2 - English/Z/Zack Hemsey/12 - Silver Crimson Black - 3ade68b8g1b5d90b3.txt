SILVER CRIMSON BLACK

Silver crimson black
That's silver crimson black
Silver crimson black
Silver crimson black

Words of a scribe
No words can describe
But they can serve as a guide
And you can learn if applied
Now some burn from the match
Some fall through the cracks
So for those lost, this a map
Silver crimson black

To know silver is to know respect
In disguise come that silver like a side effect
But silver lies with the snake, aint no idle threat
So only rest where all them silver lines bottleneck
Silver off the screen, treated patron like a saint
Silver in that spoon but don't confuse the painter with the paint
Cuz silver heed the tales of butchered men and perished souls
Leave in its path fallen beasts, silver bullet holes

Silver under gold like pressure under weight
Silver that potential, it's that key to heaven's gate
Silver when that patience conquer seizure with restraint
Silver understands the essence of no greatest of the greats
And silver tame emotion like that silver spider sews
Silver mirrors light the way that silver moon glows
And silver cut adversity so keep your hands closed
That silver crimson black a mix so few have ever known

Silver crimson black
Silver crimson black

Crimson decimate the workings of a straw man
Cut the ribbon, crimson opens with a strong ram
And crimson spread a mass of fury when the flames fan
Crimson have you searching for the exit on the floor plan
Crimson mob bold
Paint the town - red - giant uncontrolled
Red letter a's told
And crimson can seduce and turn a district into sleepers
Infect a righteous leader with a case of scarlet fever

Now let that crimson rise within, begin to see red
Catch that surprise, crimson reveals, begin to seem red
If crimson blooms all the waters up and seized red
And all the crimson in our hands leave them seas red
Mark that zone red
Sound that code red
That ringing phone's red, emergency the word said
And crimson flows from the rivers that our hearts bled
Crimson rose, redrum, murder, pose, dead

Silver crimson black
Silver crimson black
Made with sliver crimson black

Black rose pedals on the landscape when grim come near
And black roams far, it's that final frontier
When black holes swallow black's magic disappears
That black hole sorrow break the most austere
Now evil in the air, black tones sound fear
Though even if you stare black veils, all clear
And never beg a savage, black hears don't tear
But black mourns those who've departed so dear
Sincere is the reckoning, black's cloud storms
Black robes worn, black day's norm
Like black rats spread disease, black swarms
Meander in the dark and black eyes gone form
As black's knight shield the heaven's with - black - hides the messages
But black's light shows the evidence
And space is full of dark matter's black mass
Raise them stone walls, watch when black's ball smash
Cuz black's mark bear that ash from the rubble
Black bears the vault where those secret thoughts huddle
And black bares all, turn and face it if you dare
But if you run from black's bear be prepared for some trouble

Now who on earth am I
Why are we alive
What's the me in "my"
Where does time fly
All the pieces to the puzzle black hides
Black boundless explanatory gap so wide
And black envelops in that blackout
Question of the truth will lead to silence in that blackout
You should know confusion always follows when you black out
So never turn your back to black when it blacks out

Every luminescence casts a black shadow we perceive
But black's mail contain not one letter you can read
And criticize their worth but black's sheep stampede
Rely upon a plea or flee from black's ops

That silver shines when a man stand in victory
That crimson blinds from the fires of our history
That black aligns all the beauty and the misery
Crimson and that silver can shed light on black's mystery
So pull that sliver from the stone, let that red attack
Cross that silver with that black, be a silverback
And hold that crimson, red-handed as you go
Then with your black hand spin that hourglass, black widow

Silver crimson black
