NO MAN'S LAND

No man alive this planet
Can illuminate your path
No guide that came before
Can show the way beyond the pass
No footprints on the trail
For you to follow in the tracks
For you to make it there
You have to leave without the map

And no amount of pleading
Can release you from the trap
There's no degree of toil
That can serve to bridge the gap
You can trek across the plains
Without much weight upon your back
But if you're tortured in your mind
You will crumble from the facts

So flee the shelter for the storm
Before the caves collapse

I've stood among them like a ghost
They fail to recognize
Amidst the cattle and the wolves
That roam the countryside
Stood between the trenches
Where the sound of battle cried
Where reason went to die along the ground
Where hell and earth collide

And now I stand where fortune shifts
And channels open wide
Where essence flows
Within these rivers under open sky
I'm in that place
Where few have been though many tried
So if you stand for something
Stand for something
More than simply standing by

This that gem to find
This that certain kind
This the truth that hides
This is that great divide
Break out from that tomb
That empty room I've been inside
No method, no plans
No direction to advance
Just step across that line that's in the sand
This is the land of no man
