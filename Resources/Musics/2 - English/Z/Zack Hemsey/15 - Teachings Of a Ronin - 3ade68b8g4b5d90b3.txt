TEACHINGS OF A RONIN

Dogma looks but never peers through the smog
So in the clear will appear that black swan
To trap love you must wade through the fog
But try to grab it once you have it then it's gone
Now some never see beyond these walls
And some never see those worms that crawl
But mind your step or you will trip on pride's fall
Trust no man if his head above all

Stance still like the world on pause
Eased breath of a wind pre-storm
Firm grasp, let the blade conform
Manifest thy will, transform
Become sword unsheathed, cut raw
Become myth turned life, real lore
Meet the rage on the field of war
But never drink of the blood that pours

Look upon ruin and behold these ways
When you remove that leash then you'll end the dog days
Only by hand can you turn that page
Only keys of integrity unlock that cage
If you swim in foul play you will live among plague
If you cut a man's spirit he will bleed just the same
When you linger in the desert don't expect to find rain
And if you wish to know peace you must come to know pain
Every pioneer leaves a home of the brave
Every last deed has a seed that remains
And with every backlash some are shocked and afraid

But you will never see the light if you refuse to leave shade

This that jewel of the master
Steady wins the race though impatience run it faster
Turn to face the dragon as it brews your disaster
Ride upon it's back breathing flames with a rapture
In this world only victory or capture
Never sleep until that reaper come and snatch ya
And you can't starve with a belly full of laughter
Learn to take risk so reward can come after
We all the same but aint no two of us alike
And when push come to show you abstain from the fight
Receive the match of life but then decline to ignite
That's what the sage calls the wrong of two rights
So live or die, choose the former or the latter
Walk that tight rope but don't fall to the flatter
Hit 'em with the truth and that body gone shatter
I call that mind over matter
Real talk, this aint the rhyming of a rapper
It's expression of my heart but all these people got it backwards
Jam me in a box but I don't fit inside your pattern
Maybe now they'll get the message when these lyrics gone and slapped 'em
So pay attention to the key of my tone
I can lend a hand but I can't save your soul
And if you want a leader you should lead yourself home
I call my own shots, I won't sit in your throne
