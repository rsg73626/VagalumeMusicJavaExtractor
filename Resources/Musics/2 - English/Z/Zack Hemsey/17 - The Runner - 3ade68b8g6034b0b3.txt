THE RUNNER

He was living his life in a fog
Oblivion's welcoming arms
His view of society marred
No perception of forces at large
Quite the misfit and always on guard
In his mind rang a silent alarm
And so lays the ground of a future that waits
When you feel like you ain't where you are
Out of control his compulsion to flee
Absent of value as best he could see
As from within so without unto thee
Knew he'd strike out on his own eventually
And so it would be
Patience no virtue amid certainty
Fortune unknown but determinedly
On the day when he had turned twenty three
He decided to leave
He was gone

The freedom was like an addiction
He soared on a glorious high
Living to him was a mission devoid
Of objective in mind
He'd move at the drop of a dime
With no thinking or questioning why
Never developed attachment
To things all would get left behind
This was the method that patterned his ways
Perpetual motion without any reins
No repercussions, no piper to pay
No obligation to come into play
Nothing to weigh
No one to sway
No inhibition or stress to allay
"no benefit to the bonded" he'd say
"so die on the morrow but live for this day"
Lone as the wolf strays
He remained one in kind
A habit of force made as he wade far and wide
Now onwards and upwards, no grind
If you don't seek you can't find
Devil-may-care, well no devil compared
He was onto one hell of a ride
He was gone

Brick by brick, stone by stone
Block by block, home by home
Bridge by bridge, zone by zone
Piece by piece, forged his own path
Years come and gone
Sites come upon
Miles drifted on
Wounds licked and gnawed
Fate hemmed and hawed
Yet this single flaw
Fulfillment he never saw
Running from guilt and from sorrow
Disguised and from things insecurity hides
Running from doubt and the pressure
To cope with no semblance of hope on the rise
Running from heartbreak and love
Running from who he had failed to become
Running from fear he soon came to realize
He was left all alone with
But words of the wise
And so on the day when our passage entwined
Now long in the tooth at the end of his line
He said "friend, go yonder
But bear this in mind
In this world, know one truth
You can't run from time"
