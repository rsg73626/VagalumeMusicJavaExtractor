VENGEANCE

Before I die alone
Let me have vengeance
Before I die alone
I will have vengeance

(repeat)

Before I die alone
Before my time has gone
There's just one thing I have to do

Before the fire and stone
Before your world is gone
Have you some patience
Cuz I will have my vengeance

Before I die alone
Let me have vengeance
Before my time has gone
I will have vengeance

(repeat)

Before I die alone
Let me have vengeance
I will have my vengeance

Before your world is gone
Before the fire and stone
Have you some patience
Cuz I will have my vengeance

Before I die alone
Before my time has gone
Let me have vengeance
I will have vengeance
I will have vengeance
