LESSON FROM A NOMAD

I am icon
I am that pictured in those tales to song
I am that witch from the brink respawns
I bring unrest when the seas have calmed

I am legend I am fool
I am one of many I am under no rule
I am peasant I am loom
I'm disparaged I'm consumed
And most certainly confused

Am I seeing something real or is it smoke?
Am I on the ground
Or am I hung without a rope?
And this is fantasy
Or from the dream have I awoke
Am I steady on the path
Or am I clinging onto hope?

If you gather all the teachings
That the wise have told
Compile every structure from the books of old
And muse upon the meaning
Of the truth's you you've sewn
You will germinate the mind
But the fields won't grow
This is the high of low
This is the friend turned foe
This is what the light can't show
If you stand still don't expect
The earth will slow
See that every wind up plateaus
If you wanna see the rise up let go
The greatest tragedy
Is every breath takes toll
Is to live a life
And never witness depth of soul
Snake inside the rocks until you were consumed
Liberate the mind like a body in a groove
Know that sedentary can be tantamount to tomb
This is why a coma patient
Must be regularly moved
In the quest for plenty
Know the paths of many
The few will lead you past the regions
Where the past is buried
Given is the levee that will bound a mans greed
Prison is to dwell in when you take no leave
Faster than a sparrow flies traffic flies
Trap the cupid by surprise
Grab his bow and arrow
And shoot straight into the empty sky
You can spend eternity
Immersed in what's inside
But if you searching for a purpose
Than what purpose will you find?

I am icon
I am that vision
I am faith transformed
I am that allegiance to the sword you've sworn
I am false idle I am fraud
Ratchet down disaster like a phoenix in decline
Imagine double rapture with no miracle in mind
If you sing inside a cavern
Like canaries in a mine
Know indulgence is a hazard
So be wary with your time
To mean something we live and we strive for it
To feel something we fight and survive for it
To love something we scream out and cry for it
But tell me now, are you willing to die for it?
Take of what may come
As you lay on the line for it
Armoured at the call ready and primed for it
Breach the battleground with the courage
To drive forward and to know the fundamentals
Of being alive am I?
Am I?
