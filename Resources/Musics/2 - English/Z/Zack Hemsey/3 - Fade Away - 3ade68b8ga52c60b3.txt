FADE AWAY

There's time on the wall, but no one around
His will is numb, he's half in the ground
If all we are is all we were
Then he'd soon pass on without a whisper
And life goes on

And I will not be told
I won't be controlled
I don't want your cure
I won't be reassured
I will not be fixed
You're the one that's sick
And I will not decay
I won't ever fade away

I'll not fade away
There's flies on the wall and no one around
Once bright eyes are dull, she's half in the ground
And life goes on

And I will not be changed
I will not be chained
I will not be tamed
I will not behave
I will not be caged
I will not be slave
I won't be contained
I will never fade away
