LOST HIGHWAY

Where i’m going baby
You know you can’t follow
Where i’m going baby
You know you can’t follow
Well i take the lost highway home
Cause i know i’m on my own

Stranger keep on talking now
Cause you are my friend
Stranger keep on talking now
Cause you are my friend
And we’ll take the lost highway home
Cause we know we don’t belong
Well i won’t let their words get us down
Cause tonight we got both feet on the ground

Mama stop your preaching girl
You know its killing me
Mama stop your preaching girl
You know its killing me
Cause i take the lost highway home
Cause i know i’m on my own
Well i won’t let your words get me down
Cause tonight i got both feet on the ground

And he said i don’t care what you say
I’m gonna make it my own way
And she said i don’t care who’s made the rules
I’m born to break them if i choose

And together they took the lost highway

Cause i take the lost highway home
Cause i know i know i’m on my own
Well i won’t let your words get me down
Cause tonight i’m on the right street
Tonight i’m on the right beat
Tonight i got both feet on...the ground
