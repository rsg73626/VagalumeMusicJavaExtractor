LONELY

There’s a look in your eyes
Like your not really there
Say you feel the pain baby so much dispair inside
So you live your life just waitin by the phone
But none of these gonna hide an unhappy home

So you do your yoga and you try your fengshui
But none of these gonna heal girl a wound that bleeds inside
So you live your life just waitin by the phone
But none of these gonna hide an unhappy home

Cause everybody gets lonely
And its just the way things are
Everybody gets lonely
And its just the way things are
But if you call out my name
Know that i will be right there
Time and time again

You only have to say the words
And i’ll be there
You only have to say the words

There’s a way that you say that its all ok
But i can tell your in hell by yourself so closed inside
So you live your life just being alone
But none of these gonna hide an unhappy home

Cause everybody gets lonely
And its just the way things are
Everybody gets lonely
And its just the way things are
But if you call out my name
Know that i will be right there
Time and time again

You can call me
You can call me

Cause everybody gets lonely
Everybody gets lonely
And its just the way things are
