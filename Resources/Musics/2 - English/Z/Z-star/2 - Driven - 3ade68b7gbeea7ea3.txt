DRIVEN

Driven away by you again 
but it won’t change the way 
your smile ignites my will 
you got to know that I will send the arrow soon 
cause its just how its got to be 
i’m driven for you 

and i’ll be waiting on your 4 by 4 
to stop at the red light 
my waters are clean 
so your windows will sparkle in the sunlight 
but i’m driven away by you again 
yes i’m driven away by you again 

something about your ruggedness 
has got me thinking of a moonlit road to bliss 
you got to know that I will send the arrow soon 
cause its just how its got to be 
i’m driven for you 

and i’ll be waiting on your 4 by 4 
to stop at the red light 
my waters are clean 
so your windows will sparkle in the sunlight 
but i’m driven away by you again 
yes i’m driven away by you again 
driven driven
