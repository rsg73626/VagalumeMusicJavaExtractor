SLOW DANCIN

See you move cross the floor what do I do 
well I can feel your desire baby 
and you can feel mine too 
and when the dj plays a tune that I like 
well its the kind of song I wanna hear all night 

slow dancin yeh 
to feel the heat 
slow dancin to the beat 

I can’t pretend anymore i’m blue indeed 
I need to feel your body baby close to me 
now that we’re face to face you know 
somebody turned out the light 
but I can still feel the love 
burning in your eyes 

slow dancin yeh 
to feel the heat 
slow dancin to the beat
