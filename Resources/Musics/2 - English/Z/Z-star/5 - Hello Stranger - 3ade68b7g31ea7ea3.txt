HELLO STRANGER

You don’t have to be a stranger 
distant minds don’t travel far together 
and I know your not a loner 
so walk to the window watch the view won’t you 

you don’t have to dominate the groove no 
you could just flow with me like i flow with you 
and I know that you want it to 
so walk to the window watch the view won’t you 

two times to tell me how you feel 
one time to know that its for real 
three knocks upon my door 
for sure for sure for sure 

you don’t have to be the lover 
cause what you give i’m giving to you deeper 
can’t you hear me calling for you 
so walk to the window watch the view won’t you 

two times to tell me how you feel 
one time to know that its for real 
three knocks upon my door 
for sure for sure for sure 

you know I love you 

two times to tell me how you feel 
one time to know that its for real 
three knocks upon my door 
for sure for sure for sure 

now that you know 
you know that I love 
know that I love you
