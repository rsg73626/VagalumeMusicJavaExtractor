BLACK WOMAN FREAK

There’s a feelin i know i got to follow
Gonna run yeh run like there’s no tomorrow

Whats my name...black woman freak

Well i’m a black woman freak
Sizing up the street
Hanging with the curb crawlers destitutes
And the people you’ll never meet
Well i got coppers on my tail
Tryin a put me back in jail
Well i’m a fugitive on the run
I said black magic woman to some

Whats my name...black woman freak

Well i’m a black woman freak
I’m fucking with the beat
Slammin down the street law more baby more
Till you’re freakin on ya feet
I got a psychedelic brew
To make a man out of you
Well i’m a fugitive on the run
I said black magic woman to some

Whats my name...black woman freak

There’s a feelin i know i got to follow
Gonna run yeh run like there’s no tomorrow
