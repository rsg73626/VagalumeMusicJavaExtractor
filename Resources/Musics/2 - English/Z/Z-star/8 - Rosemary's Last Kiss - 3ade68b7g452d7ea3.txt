ROSEMARY'S LAST KISS

Rosemarys got you again 
and you cannot escape from her last kiss 
rosemarys got you again 
and you cannot escape from her last kiss 
for she she moves with a thorn in her side 
and she she bleeds with your love on the line 

bright colours fashion your day 
and you cannot escape the spell she’s cast you in 
bright colours fashion your day 
and you cannot escape the spell she’s cast you in 
for she she moves with a thorn in her side 
and she she bleeds with your love on the line 

and all I can do is warn you 
and all I can do is taunt you 
and all I can do is hope for her to let you go 

rosemarys got you again 
and you cannot escape from her last kiss 
rosemarys got you again 
and you cannot escape from her last kiss 
for she she moves with a thorn in her side 
and she she bleeds with your love on the line 

and all I can do is warn you 
and all I can do is taunt you 
and all I can do is hope for her to let you go 
and all I can do is warn you 
and all I can do is taunt you 
and all I can do is hope for her to disappear
