SUMMER RAIN

I am in love with the memory of you 
so many years I wonâ€™t let you go 
its so obsessive of me regressive of me 
but I need you right now like the summer rain 

if not for you then who will I bleed for 
so many years to open up that door 
its so obsessive of me regressive of me 
when I need you right now like the summer rain 

some say the truth is so cold baby 
some say the truth is so cold baby 
but I need you right now like the summer rain 

if not for you then who will I bleed for 
oh first love how breaks your dawn 
its so obsessive of me regressive of me 
when I need you right now like the summer rain 

some say the truth is so cold baby 
some say the truth is so cold baby 
but I need you right now like the summer rain 
I need you right now like the summer rain
