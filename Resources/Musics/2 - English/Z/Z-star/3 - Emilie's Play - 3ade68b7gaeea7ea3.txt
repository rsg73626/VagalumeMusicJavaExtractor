EMILIE'S PLAY

Love for a day came my way
In emilies play i felt the part
No words to say just glances
Silent romancinâ€™ in the dark

Love

Day by day and night after night
I watched her write the theme to my heart
But in the end she threw her pen
Cause words could not express the act of love

Darling love for a day came my way
Love for a day came my way
