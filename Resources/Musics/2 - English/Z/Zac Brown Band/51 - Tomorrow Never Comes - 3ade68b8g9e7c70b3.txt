TOMORROW NEVER COMES

[Verse 1]
I've been climbing my way through the sky
Searching for answers that I'll never find
Losing my breath as I fall
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
I've been trying to open my eyes
Take it all in as the world passes by
Getting lost in the twists and the turn
Finding these questions inside me still burn
Finding these questions inside me still burn

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes

[Verse 2]
I keep looking for some kind of sign
Trying to hold on in this race against time
I can't say where the next bend might be
That is the beauty in life's mystery
That is the beauty in life's mystery

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes

[Bridge]
There's no end in sight
For tonight we black out the sun
