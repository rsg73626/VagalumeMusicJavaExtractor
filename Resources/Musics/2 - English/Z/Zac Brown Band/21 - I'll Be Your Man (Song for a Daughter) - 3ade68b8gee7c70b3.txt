I'LL BE YOUR MAN (SONG FOR A DAUGHTER)

You're gonna make
The finest mama some day
Some man will take you away
But until then

Chase down your dreams
Laugh all the time and believe
That love's gonna conquer all things
So until then, I'll be your man

There was a time when
I thought I knew love
Until you came into this world
Time keeps on flying
But you're always
Gonna be my baby girl

So as you walk
Through this life you will see
The world's what you want it to be
But until then

Go on and dance
Dance like there's no one around
Never stop singing out loud
And until then, I'll be your man

Go have a ball
Take every chance that you may
You know I'll be one call away
I'll always be, I'll always be your man

Hold on child
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold on child
Hold on tight to your old man

I'm gonna hold you tight
Under my wing long as I can
Hold you tight
Under my wing long as I can

Hold on child
(Sweet child of mine)
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold on child
(Hold on tight)
Hold on tight to your old man

Hold you tight
(I'm gonna hold you tight)
Hold on tight to your old man
Hold you tight
(Hold on tight)
Under my wing long as I can

(Outro)
