JUNKYARD

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
I have lived in a junkyard
Where the weeds eat up the rain
If you get anything there out of place
You know there's hell to pay

[Chorus 1:]
And he said, "You're as sick as you are lovely
And in need of a hand. "
He tells me, "You are never worthy, "
But I was just a child, you see?
That was my reality

[Verse 2:]
He had a sick little girl
Dirty and hard, with a breast plate made of metal
She drives all day in her rusty Buick
And her feet don't reach the pedals
Got a jar of flies, father's disguise
Where his heart should be
Her mouth is sewn together
She screams with those eyes

[Chorus 2:]
"She is sick, she is lovely
And in need of my hand. " (Yeah he uses his hands)
He tells her, "You are never worthy. "
She was all alone, you see?
That was her reality

[Bridge:]
I should have been sleeping
Should have been dreaming
But I wake up to broken glass
There'll be one more empty desk in my homeroom class
I got an old bone pocket knife tight in my right hand
To save my poor mother from the junkyard man!

[Chorus 3:]
He's as sick as she is lovely
And in need of a hand
He will know he's not worthy
When he dies alone, you see?
That''s his reality

[Chorus 4:]
I'm not sick, I am lovely
Hatred is the curse of man
I will not feel unworthy
Because I have washed my hands, you see?
That's my reality
