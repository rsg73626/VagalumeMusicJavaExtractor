HOMEGROWN

I got a piece of land out in the country side
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Been so good to me, takin' it easy

Why would I ever leave?
'Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Live in a small town where it feels like home
I've got everything I need, and nothin' that I don't

Homegrown
Homegrown

We got a fire goin', down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, livin' like we'll never die
C'mon and stay a while if you don't believe me

It's the way that you carry it for the things you think you want
It's the way that you carry it for the things you think you want
It's the way that you carry it for the things you think you want

I've got everything I need, nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Everything I need, nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Everything I need, nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Ooh everything I need, and nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
