HIGHWAY 20 RIDE

I ride east every other Friday
but if I had it my way
the day would not be wasted on this drive.
and I want so bad to hold you
Son there's things I haven't told you
your mom and me couldn't get along

so I drive, and I think about my life
and wonder why, that I'll slowly die inside
every time I turn that truck around right at the Georgia line
and I count the days and the miles back home to you
on that highway 20 ride.

The day might come you?ll realize
That if you see thru my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
Son please don't mistake me
For a man that didnt care at all

And drive, and I think about my life
And wonder why, that?ll slowly die inside
Every time i turn that truck around right at the Georgia line
And I count the days and the miles back home to you
On that highway 20 ride.

So when you drive, and the years go flying by
I hope you smile, if I ever cross your mind
It was the pleasure of my life
And I cherished everytime
And my whole world it begins and ends with you
On that highway 20 ride

Whoa 20 ride x 2
Highway 20 ride.
and I ride...
Whoa...
