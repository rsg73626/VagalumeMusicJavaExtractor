THE MUSE

As I sit on the edge of this never made bed
Old guitar in my lap a new tune in my head
There she stands in the doorway just brushing her hair
It's my beautiful muse in her underwear

And if I was thinking I'd be thinking thank god
Wherever you are
For the muse and this old guitar
It's times like these so sweet and so true
Thinking is the last thing that you wanna do

As I sit on the edge of this dirty old bar
Trying to work some things out without getting too far
And to drown out the voices that are keeping me down
There's a muse all alone on the other side of town

And if I was thinking I'd be thinking thank god
Wherever you are
For all the whiskey in this dirty old bar
Times like these are so sad but so true
Thinking's the last thing that you wanna do
Yeah, thinking's the last thing that you wanna do

As I sit on the bed of this hospital room
Just shedding a tear for the bride and groom
And the tiniest voice starts to bellow and cry
It's my finest work yet if today I should die

And if I was thinking I'd be thinking thank god
For the muse and the miracle right here in my arms

Times like these are so sweet and so true
Thinking's the last thing that you wanna do
Yeah, thinking's the last thing that you wanna do
Yeah, thinking's the last thing that you wanna do
