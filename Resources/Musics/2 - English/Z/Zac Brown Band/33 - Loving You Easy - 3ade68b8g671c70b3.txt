LOVING YOU EASY

Every morning when you come down stairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
Make-up on shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right

Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that don't know
Cause I'm finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do

Every little smile
Every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candlelight
Gonna slow this down and make it last
Best things fly by so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do

Every little smile
And every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
(Ohh I wanna sing it again)

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do

Every little smile
And every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Easy Easy
