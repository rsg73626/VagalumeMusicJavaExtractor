LET IT RAIN

Maybe I'm wounded. The pain it is passing
Can you hold back the show for a while?
Beneath the hat that I'm wearing
The storms are all brewing and maybe its time to go on
Structure is quoting and the wood it is cracking
And the thoughts are all starting to fall
And it's more to say than what's been said
And people are climbing the wall

Let it Rain. Let it pour
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard
With things they can't hold me no more
Breathe in deep. Let it out
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth
Threes no room left for darkness
When, you're filled with the light it comes out

The truth hurts the worse
So you might as well face it so the slate
Can again be wiped clean
Standing on the shore of tomorrow's horizon
Let music set you free

Let it Rain. Let it pour
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard
With things they can't hold me no more
Breathe in deep. Let it out
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth
Threes no room left for darkness
When you're filled with the light it comes out

It's a call to all fighters, to all sinners and thieves
Fill the years with the music that set their hearts free
I smash these stings till me fingers bleed
Lay down all your burdens (to sing back to me?)

Let it Rain. Let it pour
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard
With things they can't hold me no more
Breathe in deep. Let it out
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth
Threes no room left for darkness when
You're filled with the light
Threes no room left for darkness babe
Threes no room left for darkness when
You're filled with the light it comes out
