UNCAGED

Gonna drift to the great wide open
Gonna set my spirit free
Won't stop until I reach the ocean
Gonna break these chains holding me
Uncaged!

Gonna swim in the coldest river
Gonna drink from a mountain spring
Defend the land of the great wide open
Gonna let the water roll all over me.
Uncaged!

Oooooohhhhhhhhhhh!
Ooooohhh!
I wanna swim in the sunshine.
Every day find a way to face my fears.
Oooohhhh! I wanna get in the wind,
Gonna take every chance I'm given
Feel the wind through the open plains
Freedom is a gift worth living
Go chase that sunset highway down
You got to get uncaged!
