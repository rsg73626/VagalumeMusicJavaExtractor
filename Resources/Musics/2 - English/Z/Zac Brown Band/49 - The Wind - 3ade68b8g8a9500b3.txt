THE WIND

30 thousand feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fading country skyline
Brings an urban lullaby
That still rings true

When I passed you on the street that day
Shoulda let that rest gon fly away
Like any chance I had of keeing you
Like the Northern Wind that blowin
Yeah my lonely heart is frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours too

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Just like I always did

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love


The city lights will light the country sky
We're staring at the stars turned upside down
I wish I may I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances of seeing love
Are precious few
If someones out there waiting
For a sweet good time and a lady
To make you smile just like I always wanted to

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Just like I always did

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

So I found out
Our memories my lullaby and love wont lie
It was love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide if love dont lie
Lie we can fly

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Just like I always did

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love
