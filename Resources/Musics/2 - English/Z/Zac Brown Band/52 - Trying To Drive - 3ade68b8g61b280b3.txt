TRYING TO DRIVE

Aslyn
He might be right
I'm out of luck when I'm out of feist and out of touch
With this little smile I call my own
Don't feel like home anymore

Zac brown
But you make the most of what it's not
Till a little love feels like a lot
And I blame you and you blame me
And this little war evens everything in time

Chorus
Aslyn
But you're not always right
Zac brown
I'm not always wrong
Aslyn
It's not like I don't try
Both
This is where we belong
One way, everythings gonna be away
Aslyn
But darlin', I'm on your side
Both
Cause it's the one wheel, four hands, two hearts trying to understand
How we gonna to get there?
We're both trying to drive

Zac Brown
No one can do what you do
You know I'm not right if I'm not right with you
And I'll save you if you save me
And I'll be the one to lay it all out on the line

Chorus

Aslyn
I can feel it under my seat
You're on the sideline of my life
Watch the rain fall to the ground
To the beat of the same old fight

Zac Brown
And every song is brewing this war
And I find myself

Both
In the mix of it, give a little bit
We're gonna fly, gonna fly, fly

Aslyn
One way, everythings gonna be away
But darlin' I'm on your side

Zac Brown
Darlin' I'm on your side

Both
Cause it's the one wheel, four hands, two hearts trying to understand
How we gonna to get there?
One way, everythings gonna be away

Aslyn
But darlin' I'm on your side

Both
Cause it's the one wheel, four hands, two hearts trying to understand
How we gonna to get there?
We're both trying to drive. (x5)
