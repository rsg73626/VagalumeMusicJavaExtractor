WIDLFIRE

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing 'bout loving me
Is gonna be easy
I've never been the kind
Who would ever play it safe
If you wanna come along
Then you best believe me
I'm making you a promise
That I'm never gonna break

[Chorus]
Gotcha burning like a wildfire, baby
Running out of control
Take you walking on a highwire crazy
No net down below
It's gonna get a little too far out there
Just you wait and see
Love you like a wildfire
Come swimming in the flames with me

[Verse 2]
It'll be the best part of a romance novel
Writing our story, mama, line by line
See how it might feel like trouble
Staring down the barrel of a heart like mine

[Chorus]
And get you burning like a wildfire, baby
Running out of control
Take you walking on a highwire crazy
No net down below
It's gonna get a little too far out there
Just you wait and see
Love you like a wildfire
Come swimming in the flames with me

[Bridge]
I wanna chase your love
Like a tail chases a comet
And move you like the wind
Through the amber waves of grain
I wanna lay you down
In a field of autumn clover, honey
Don't look down, just take my hand

[Chorus]
Wildfire, baby
Running out of control
Take you walking on a highwire crazy
No net down below
It's gonna get a little too far out there
Just you wait and see
Love you like a wildfire, wildfire
Come swimming in the flames with me
