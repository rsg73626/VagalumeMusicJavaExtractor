GOT WHATEVER IT IS

She's got eyes that cut you like a 
knife and 
lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees 

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman 
but couldn't find the words to say
You've got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel 
it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to 
stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know 
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman 
but couldn't find the words to say
You've got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel 
it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

When you love me
Girl that's how I feel
When you love me I'm on top of the world
Because when you love me I can live forever
When you love me I am untouchable

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman 
but couldn't find the words to say
You've got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel 
it comes out "I love you"
