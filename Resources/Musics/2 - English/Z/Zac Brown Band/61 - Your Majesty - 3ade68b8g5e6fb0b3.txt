YOUR MAJESTY

First time I saw you, I just couldn't look away
Found what I'd been lookin' for, but I couldn't stay
But my heart was full and my eyes, they could not believe
How you wrapped your arms around me
Your majesty

I wanna slow it down where the water's deep
Get the northern keeling washing over me
Made me better man
And it's plain to see
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease

Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
OOh
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)

Now I'm flyin' in to meet you, I can hardly wait
Do you know how much I've missed you since I've been away
Bringing all my love from Georgia, and I'm gonna lay
Under endless skies of emerald light, we can drift away

I wanna slow it down where the water's deep
Get the northern keeling washing over me
Made me better man
And it's plain to see
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease
And I'm humbled in the presence of your majesty

Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
OOh
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)

Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
OOh
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)

You can have it all
Burn all my things
To be at your feet
And kneel before my queen

Now I'm gonna stay out where the air is clean
'Cause I've freed myself from these city streets
Found a better man waking inside of me
The nature of your beauty puts me mind at ease
And I'm humbled in the presence of your majesty
And I kneel down in the presence of
Your majesty

Ooh!
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
OOh
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Uh, oh, oh-oh

Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Oh, oh
