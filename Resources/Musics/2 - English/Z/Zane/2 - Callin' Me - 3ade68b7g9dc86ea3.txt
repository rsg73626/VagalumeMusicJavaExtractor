I live the life of a celebrity
A made figga way bigger than them other cats you love to see
I'm getting paid like I'm supposed to
My homies call me on my mobile wanna hang we still close too
I switched positions with them cold cats
I write raps, make millions like that
I like that (hey yeah) really never was a rich man
A rubber band for a wrist band
Got dough and had to switch plans
Trouble still don't stop
The freeway getting chased by some bad missies
wanting autographed pictures (oohh)
They want my name tattooed on them
thinkin for a minute hit that ass make a move on them
Hey! Hennessey with the chardonnay, mix it
I put the trees in the ??, twist it (whooaa yeah)
A true player smoking purple haze
Two shots in the air for my true thugs out there
(This life I live of mine)

This life I live of mine (yeah)
This life is crazy (yeah)
I waste no time at all (ahuh)
They won't stop calling me (it's goin down baby)
This life I live of mine (yeah)

They won't stop calling me (ugh)
Calling me, calling me, calling me (Hey Lil' Zane!), say my name!
Calling me, calling me, calling me (Hey Lil' Zane!), say my name!

Let me explain what the game is like
I did a show in california had to be in Las Vegas the same night
Me and 112 on the same flight and getting tired
It aint easy being worldwide (worldwide, worldwide, worldwide)
I seen murder come with fame in this rap game
Gotta stay straped if you rap so i pack thangs
All my dogs pack thangs
Aand plus we love to ball
Dont want no problem with you homie I mean none at all (not at all)
And to my rich cats with them big faced bills in the air
My po' cats sell more sex to you
Love green millionaires
Been all around the world
Turned the squares into true players
Cheap watches turned to Cartiers
Locals turned to gators
Point 3's turn to 5 c's all these car keys
Jump in the benz and hit The Shark Bar
You know they love to see a hot star

And for my dogs I ain't seen in awhile
I still got love for y'all ain't got a chance to return your call
I'm in chicago
I'm getting paid man bigger figgas everywhere that I go
I'm still hearing about drama poppin in the hood
Heard everybody doing good and i like that
Irv said y'all got the block locked
He tell me K and big Chris driving drop tops
Flossing I'm getting letters hard to write back
Put a fly picture in the mail hope they like that
Prayin that the fame don't kill us all
The magazines to the big screens
He ain't easy as the shit seems
Throwin up my dueces as a pass by
Showing love to the southside all the players outside
And we gon' spend G's tonight
Hotel's on me shit's free tonight
C'mon!
