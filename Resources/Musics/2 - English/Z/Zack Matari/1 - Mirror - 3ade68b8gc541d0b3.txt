MIRROR

(Alright ladies, to the dance floor) (Woo)

Don't shy away from the beauty on the inside
Summer's here now, you should let it all outside
Step, step like a queen
Strut your stuff, let it all be seen
God bless, don't care what they think
Curls all, poppin'
Beauty marks, poppin'
Curves and the hips do all the talkin'
Something 'bout you that I wanna get lost in

Confidence is somthin' that you got girl
Powerful and beauty in the mind girl
Put your insecurities away now
Show your colors, different shapes and sizes
Proud of who you are, don't ever hide it
Put your insecurities away
Put your insecurities away

Mirror, on the wall
Won't you tell me who they are?
I said, mirror on the wall
Won't you tell them who you are?
Mirror, mirror, mirror you know who you are
Mirror, mirror, mirror you know who you are

Now stop!
Take a second to imagine
Walkin' in the world, no shame to be lavish
Confidently step into the carriage
Love yourself, queen it girl savage
I dont know 'bout what you're lookin' for
But I'll tell you everyday
It ain't the outfit you wear out that door
It's the smile that you wear on your face

Confidence is somthin' that you got girl
Powerful and beauty in the mind girl
Put your insecurities away now
Show your colors, different shapes and sizes
Proud of who you are, don't ever hide it
Put your insecurities away
Put your insecurities away

Mirror, on the wall
Won't you tell me who they are?
I said, mirror on the wall
Won't you tell them who you are?
Mirror, mirror, mirror you know who you are
Mirror, mirror, mirror you know who you are

You know, you know who you are
Come on
[Brass?]

Mirror, on the wall (Mirror, on the wall)
Won't you tell me who they are? (Ah)
I said, mirror on the wall (Woo)
Won't you tell them who you are? (Tell them who you are)
Mirror, mirror, mirror you know who you are
Mirror, mirror, mirror you know who you are

You know, you know who you are

You know, you know who you are
