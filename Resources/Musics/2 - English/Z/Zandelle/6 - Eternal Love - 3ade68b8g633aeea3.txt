ETERNAL LOVE

Heaven, it seems so close when you're by my side
When we're together it's paradise
There's nothing in this world that brings me greater joy
As when I look into your eyes

I never wanted anyone so much before

I call you up just so I could hear your voice
Your laughter is music to my ears
Your gentle touch sends shivers down my spine
My passion soars when you are near

My love for you grows stronger day by day
My heart belongs to you, believe me when I say

My life means nothing without you
I feel such joy when we're together
With all my heart I cherish you
I want to make you mine forever my love

To kiss your tender lips and feel your warm embrace
When you're upset, to make you smile
To whisper in your ear and take you by the hand
I'd travel for one million miles

The thought of losing you is just too much to bear
Just hear these words and you will see how much I care

My life means nothing without you
I feel such joy when we're together
With all my heart I cherish you
I want to make you mine forever my love
