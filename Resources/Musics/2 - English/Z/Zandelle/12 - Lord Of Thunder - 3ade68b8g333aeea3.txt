LORD OF THUNDER

Out of the shadows
On a stallion black as night
To face any danger I am prepared
Full leather armor
Enchanted sword in hand
Cold determination in my stare

Spirits of vengeance they call
I'll reign supreme never fall

Armies will rise
None will prevail
I'll crush them all
Until no one remains
Face me and die
Send you to hell
Destiny calls
Lord of thunder is my name

Undying power
Comes from within
No turning back must go on
Fate stands before me
Face it with pride
Battle their armies till they're gone

Enemies' blood stains my sword
Rush in to battle the hoard

[repeat chorus]

Eternal honor and majesty
Fear has no place in my soul
I journey on for I can't be delayed from my goal
Undying flame burns inside of me
Taking control of my blade
Taking revenge on those from whom I have been betrayed

[solo: Maglio]
