WARLORDS OF STEEL

Our hearts race with every beat, a thunderous roar fills the air
The majesty and grandeur coursing through our veins
The war is far from over, our enemies must beware
We'll show them that our power forever remains

We must all stand together and show them we won't fall
Cry out and tell the world once and for all
Our strength cannot be stopped we can't be pushed away
Our power is growing stronger it is here to stay

Warlords of steel bringing our strength to you
Keeping true to our faith
Now we reveal the power we know is true
Warriors here to say...supreme we will reign!

Fight on forever to survive, we must not give up our dreams
Stand proud and show them all that we will not give in
Be true to your hearts hold tight what you believe
With our strength and power we will win

No one has the right to decide your fate for you
They'll tell you otherwise but inside you know it's true
We will not tolerate this oppressive state we're in
We'll fight with all our hearts, the power lives within

Out of the shadows of night we will rise unleashing the power foretold
The power and valor lives on in our hearts and with it we'll never grow old.
With fists held high we'll lead the fight
And crush them all with our never ending might!

Scream loud let your voice be heard, let the whole world hear your cry
A monstrous shout that echoes well into the night
We will never surrender they can't hold us down
With valor in our hearts, don't give up the fight

With our battle cry we'll chill them to the bone
We'll make them run and hide under every rock and stone
They cannot hold us down, the power is in our hearts
And if they try to stop us we'll tear them all apart
