DRAGON'S HOARD

For hundreds of winters the dragon lay sleeping in a cavern far beneath the earth
Protecting its treasure from any who'd venture too near
Once every decade it'd rise from its slumber to soar over mountains and seas
Collecting more treasure while filling the heartland with fear

Mighty wings would lift it higher from one city to the next
Kills its foes with breath of fire, powerful demon of death

Many attempted to bring the dragon down
Widows their wives soon became
Collecting its treasure from across the land
'Protecting my hoard'
From his foes with its breath of flame

Back in its cavern the dragon would travel to sleep for another ten years
Content in the knowledge that its treasure hoard had grown
Few brave souls would dare to pursue it in hopes to slay it in its sleep
And have many stories of their noble deeds be told

Not knowing that sleeping dragons can detect someone nearby
They'd rush in to find the dragon was awake its foes would die

Many attempted to bring the dragon down
Widows their wives soon became
Collecting its treasure from across the land
'Protecting my hoard'
From his foes with its breath of flame

Many attempted to bring the dragon down
Widows their wives soon became
Collecting its treasure from across the land
'Protecting my hoard'
From his foes with its breath of flame
