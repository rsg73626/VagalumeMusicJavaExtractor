THE CYCLE

We're born in this world and we live our lives
For how long we do not know
We do what we can, we can do no more
Cause sooner or later we'll go
When will it end, how much time is left
Will I know when my time is near?
Will there be a tunnel with a light at the end
Or will darkness fill my soul with fear

Oh no, I see it coming
The end is getting closer for us all
There is no use denying
From any height we'll all soon fall

On we go
And on we go
How long
For how long we do not know
Till the end
Until the end
Darkness
When darkness is our only friend

[solo: Durfy]

Can't take any more, I just want to know
Will I die alone and in pain?
Or will I go on while my friends pass away
I think that would drive me insane
To be born to die is senseless to me
A logic that I cannot see
To know your existence is governed by time
Can drive you to insanity

[Repeat pre-chorus / chorus]

Living in this daydream
Wondering when it will end
Now I run away into the night
Can't escape my fears as they fill me with fright
I must accept the truth of how things are
And hope the cycle's end for me is still quite far

[solo: Maglio]
[repeat pre-chorus / chorus]
