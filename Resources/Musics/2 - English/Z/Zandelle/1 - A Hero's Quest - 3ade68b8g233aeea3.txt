A HERO'S QUEST

I've journey for so long to fulfill my quest
Surrounded by danger I'm put to the test
Through darkness and fire been tempted by sin
Just sit back and listen as my tale begins

The winter cold cut through me as I traveled through the night
A lost soul in the darkness to find the holy light
When suddenly from nowhere a sight befell my eyes
What was it that I saw there I did not realize

A demon from the pit of hell I must fight to survive
The Quest goes on

That was just the beginning more challenges ahead
The next one that I faced was a goddess in her bed
Her beauty was astounding seduction in her eyes
But underneath that beauty her evil secret lies

Had I not beat the succubus I surely would have died
The Quest goes on

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I felt like I would never locate that which I sought
My trek felt like forever though valiantly I fought
When finally the day came where right before these eyes
I found what I've been seeking my ever treasured prize

Little did I know back then that it was just a lie
The Quest goes on

And so ends my story my quest has yet to end
Continue on my journey the road my only friend
So now I take my leave and I will be on my way
In hopes that I will complete my quest some other day
