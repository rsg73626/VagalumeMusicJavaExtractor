THE CHAMPION

In another place and time
A young man on a quest for knowledge
Traveled far a wide all across the land
But the road ahead was full of danger
He never dreamed of the risks he'd find
As he traveled this road of earth and sand

Now he fights on
Struggles to survive day by day
Eternal champion
To the gods of chaos doeth he pray

Warrior from a race of evil
Savior is what he wants to be
Wanderer he travels on forever
Tries to find that which he doeth seek

He gets so close but still too far
Always fall short of his goal
Determination drives him on and on
From a magic blade he gets his power
As it drink the souls of his enemies
Longs to return to a home that's so far gone

Always travelling
Hoping that one day he'll see his home
Self-banished emperor
For how much longer must he roam?

[repeat chorus]

He left his love behind
His cousin rules his land
As he faces death everywhere he turns
He tries to find the answers
That he has yet to find
The flame of conviction in his soul burns

[solo: Durfy]
[repeat chorus]
