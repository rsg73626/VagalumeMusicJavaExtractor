BLOOD RED SHORES

Race across the water toward the distant shores
Soldiers filled with honor, we're heading off to war
My hands start shaking as anxiety takes hold
As we near the beaches to conquer our foes

Storm the beach do or die, Semper Fi
My foot hits the sand as all hell breaks loose
Half my men cut down

They had never told us that it would be like this
Bullets flying everywhere while bombs blow men to bits
Nowhere to take cover from above death rains
See the medics rushing to those who scream in pain

Storm the beach do or die, Semper Fi
The horrors that I see will haunt my very thoughts
For all my days

Blood
I see it everywhere
From the bodies of those who never stood a chance
On
And on we go
I just pray I don't die on these blood red shores of France

Now many years later I think back to that morn
How my long time friends and I had all gone off to war
Now we're back together, feel sadness in my bones
Read the words of valor upon our tombstones

Storm the beach do or die, Semper Fi
When I close my eyes the images return
So vividly

Blood
I see it everywhere
From the bodies of those who never stood a chance
On
And on we went
As so many had died on those blood red shores of France
