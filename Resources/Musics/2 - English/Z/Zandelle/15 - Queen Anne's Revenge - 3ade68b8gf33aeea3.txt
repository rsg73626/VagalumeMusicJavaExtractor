QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE

He terrorized the eastern waters for three dreadful years
His savagery is legendary, His name has lived on through the ages
Born in the end of the 1600's, his given name was Edward
One look at him would terrify, Black-Beard is what he became known as

He made himself look hellish
Framing his face in fire
By placing long lighted matches
Under his hat to strike fear in his prey

He'd hide his ship and lay in waiting for some unsuspecting vessel
He'd attack with such ferocity, No one ever acted so fiercely
He carried three bracers of pistols, had lots of rum for all his men
When things got slow he'd stir thing up, By shooting his guns in his dark cabin

They say he had fourteen wives
And a governor's refuge
He came to shore quite often
He even once took the King's pardon

He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
So many met with a watery grave
So many ships fell by his hand
His pure brutality knew no bounds
The ocean's devil and his evil band

He had taken such a toll upon the sea
All the people cried for something to be done
Then Virginia's governor had had enough
He sent his own ship to capture him dead or alive


He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
Then in the year 1718
On November twenty first
Near the Ocracoke Inlet
Twenty-five wounds ended his blood-thirst
