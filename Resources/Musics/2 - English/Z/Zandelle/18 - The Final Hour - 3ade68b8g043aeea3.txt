THE FINAL HOUR

The prophecy had been foretold for centuries
Revealing visions of the end
The current state of things unveiling signs of doom
The horsemen now are on their way

You cannot run you cannot hide
Your prayers can't save you now the time has come to die

When the night falls, oh
And the moon is red as blood
The final hour, oh
The beast will arise and prepare its victory

The Time has come to lay to rest the Enemy
The hour of Death is drawing near
The Famine strikes all hope is lost as thousands fall
Disease and Pestilence rage on

No turning back we shall not fall
Bloodthirsty demons attack in the night and now we must fight for our lives

When the night falls, oh
And the moon is red as blood
The final hour, oh
The beast will arise and prepare its victory


As corpses rot the One stands tall
The greatest evil that the world has ever known

When the night falls, oh
And the moon is red as blood
The final hour, oh
The beast will arise and prepare for
When the night falls, oh
And the moon is red as blood
The final hour, oh
The One will arise and declare its victory
Oh
Declaring the battle won
