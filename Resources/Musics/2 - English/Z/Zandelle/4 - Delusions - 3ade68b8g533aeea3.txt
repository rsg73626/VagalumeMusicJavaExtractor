DELUSIONS

Fire burning inside
Blinded by your hate you do not see
Actions based on ego
Swimming in a pool of vanity
You think you're the greatest
If only you would open up your eyes
Delusions of grandeur
Now's the time to make you realize

Down on your knees you will see
Our ultimate power
Beg and plead all you want
Before us you will cower
Never more will you feel
That you're above everyone
You will see what greatness is
Cause our time has come

Wake up you are dreaming
Living in a world of fantasy
What makes you think so highly
of yourself come back to reality
Talking full of hot air
You are fooling no one but yourself
Suffering from delusions
Your problem lies within your mental health

[repeat chorus]

I've come to show you who has the might
You'll see that I'm right
Now you can't deny it
Before me you will bow down low
And now that you know
You just cannot fight it

[solo: Durfy]
[repeat Chorus]
