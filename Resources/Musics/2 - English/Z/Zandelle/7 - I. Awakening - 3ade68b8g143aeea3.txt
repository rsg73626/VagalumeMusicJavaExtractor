I. AWAKENING

In the abyss where demons reign
Lies the unholy one
Waits for the time when he would rise
To reek havoc on the world
Soon his time approaches, soon he will unleash
Death and carnage through land
Undying rage fuels his black heart
His thirst for blood beyond contain
Now the gate has opened, doorway to our world
The beast will now venture through
