INVITATION

Come now and listen to legends and history
Heroes and demons and devils and gods
Come hear our stories of valor and infamy
Tales of the past that was both near and far

Hear now our songs as they take you to distant lands
You will find that our tales will enchant you
Enter our world do not fear we shall be your guides
As you journey through our realm of legends

Ancient tales, stories of honor
Tales of revenge on land and on sea
Creatures of myth, hoarding of treasure
The end of days, and mystery
