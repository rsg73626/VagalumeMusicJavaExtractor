CRY FOR VENGEANCE

With morning light the terror came which shocked us to the core
An enemy from foreign lands right at our very door
With cold indifference he did strike not caring who would die
Believing the insanity, brought terror from the sky

Cry out!
We shall avenge the fallen
Unite!
We must destroy them all
Stand strong!
We will not show them mercy
They all must fall

From an early age they have been taught to hate and kill our kind
Claiming it's a holy war, they're all out of their minds
Brainwashed fools believing all they're told, why can't they see?
Beyond the lies they're being fed by their hypocrisy

Cry out!
We shall avenge the fallen
Unite!
We must destroy them all
Stand strong!
We will not show them mercy
They all must fall

Cry for revenge
We must seek out our enemies
War has been waged
We must take up the fight
No other choice
Into battle we all must go
Time has arrived
Now they will feel our furious might


Cry for vengeance cry for glory - We will prevail
Seek them out and kill them all - They cannot hide
Show no mercy, fight with fury -Vengeance is ours
Honor bound we will not fall - They all must die
