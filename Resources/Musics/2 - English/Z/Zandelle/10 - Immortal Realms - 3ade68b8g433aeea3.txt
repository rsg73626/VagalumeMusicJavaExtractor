IMMORTAL REALMS

Welcome to a land where Fairies dwell and mighty Dragons fly
Where Dwarven smiths make swords of steel and castles touch the sky
The Elves they move with utmost grace while Giants stand so tall
And sailors become mesmerized by the Sirens' call

Dryads and Nymphs they can be found if you look hard enough
In the Immortal Realms

An ageless time when magic reigned and honor ruled the land
Where kings and queens control the nations across the seas and sands
Where wizards cast their deadly spells while prophets tell one's fate
And evil monsters terrorize full of anger and hate

Goblins, Orcs and Trolls spread fear and terror in the land
Of the Immortal Realms

Immortal Realms!

Come take my hand
Let go of all your hate and anger
Open your eyes and your mind
You're in my world
And I can be your guide through it
Leave all your fears behind

Cast your doubts away and give in to your dreams
Not everything that you see is as it seems
For every evil there's a hero prepared to die
Accept these words from me and do not question why

[solo: Maglio]

Immortal Realms!
