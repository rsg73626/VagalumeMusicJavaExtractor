II. VENGEANCE RISING

From the darkest pits of hell he has come
To devour and destroy all
His hatred he'll unleash on all who cross his path
He is evil incarnate

Vengeance rising from the ashes
Death is coming for you all

He will bring forth your demise, kill you all
In his wake he leaves slaughter
He's the butcher of the land, you're his prey
He is evil like no other

Vengeance rising from the ashes
Death is coming for you all
Ancient evil is upon you
Endless bloodshed, all will fall

To Denmark he has come, ancient land
Attacks them in the darkness
Rips flesh right off their bones, then he drinks their blood
Takes pleasure in the madness

Vengeance rising from the ashes
Death is coming for you all
Ancient evil is upon you
Endless bloodshed, all will fall

His thirst for blood cannot be quenched
He will spread this massacre far and wide

There is no end in sight, no escape
From this annihilation
All who face him die, Grendel is his name
Total devastation

Vengeance rising from the ashes
Death is coming for you all
Ancient evil is upon you
Endless bloodshed, all will fall
