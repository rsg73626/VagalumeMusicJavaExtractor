CIRCULATION

Be confident - I know sometimes (I am)
And satisfied – I know, I’ll try
All your fear, all your pain is unfounded
Try to feel like the child you once have been
Full of expectation

 
Stop dreaming, cause it is in vain

Just screaming - about the circulation of our lifes
 

Be unconcernd – I know, sometimes (I am)
And free of rage – I know, I’ll try
There’s a god, there’s a heaven to feel saved
Try to be glad and grateful then you’ll see
That your sorrow’s dying

 

Stop dreaming…

- from the cradle to the grave

- I cry, oh why
 

Stop dreaming, cause it is in vain

Just screaming, cause there is no change
 
Stop dreaming, cause it is in vain

Just screaming, about the circulation of our lifes
