GREY AND RED

In the sky everything’s between black and white
Trees rise into nothingness
Dark clouds cause a rising tide
The blossoming rose shattered
Far too soon in a blaze of anger
It´s over
Don´t lay the blame on me
In your hate and in your rage
 

Chorus:
I see colours, I see light
You stay in the dark
I don’t see you
Not anymore!
 

Now the trees are clad in rich green
Though my soul still dwells in grey
It hurts when I see you
Pointed thorns hidden under petals
And still I ask myself why does it hurt


Soon I’ll paint colours into the sky
Sometime it will be full of light
The life I beared is dead by then
And a different one is born
You clad your world in black

Mine I colour red


Chorus:
It´s over
Don´t lay the blame on me
In your hate, in your rage


I see colours, I see light
You stay in the dark
I don’t see you
Not anymore!
