YOU HAVE LOST

Desolation, gloomy days
Has it ever been different,
Did we know the light?
Faces, blurred shadows

Close your eyes

Remember and yell

Deep inside survived the child


The child believed in all the beauty
Desasterous to lock it up
Is there a spark of light inside you?
Love and enjoy- life is short


Chorus:
You are born to learn your lesson
And before you realize
You have lost
