SEARCH FOR YOU

All power, all hope
Wich held you up long time
The belief in a little luck
All things that ment something to you
Are lost in the past
 

If you run into your dreams
It will get you, hurts your mind
Lacrates your instinct
And your painful screams
Are getting lost in the past
 

Chorus:

Back to the past
To search what you have lost
Do you know it
In search of you
