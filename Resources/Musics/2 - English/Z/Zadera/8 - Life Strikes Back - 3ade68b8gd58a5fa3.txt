LIFE STRIKES BACK

You are a star now
You’re mine
From this place from where the angels glow
We’ll alleviate world from its pain

 
This is our lightning now high in the sky
(And) our feets are where worms try to feed
Their greed, their bloodshed, their sickness
We’ll see, we’ll destroy their revolting fortress.


Throughout this time we glow
Like angels in wich we are
This is the time to climb the stars
No need to feed worms with greed

 
Chorus:
No one resists, no one can reach
This silver destination, this warm place
No one resists, no one can live
When we’re together in grand grace
