NO ANSWERS

Sorry, I’m sorry
I had to go
There are no answers
To your questions
There’s nothing to understand
 

I see your tears
I can hear your scream
My heart is bleeding
I can’t do anything
It would ruin more and more
 

I don’t feel better
I’m not stronger than you
The feelings were so real
As real as pain
Please listen for a last time
 

Chorus:
No questions
There are no answers
I don’t want to lie no more
