SHAME

Hey girl – do you feel alone
Nobody realy cares
Dreams of trust and love are gone
Comfort’s waiting here
 

Follow me down to the place
That some before have seen
You don’t need to feel ashamed
I promise, you won’t be alone
 

Dear uncle, save me out of my grief
Please try to help me – I want to feel


Your sight makes me feel aronsed
Now I’ll start my game
I order to take of your clothes
Your time has come, expect the pain
 

Please do not hurt me, I feel afraid
I want to go now – Let me be …



She was found at the fields was
Naked and filthy
With eyes dull and cold
He walks still through the alleys

Search for a new love
To play his game again.
