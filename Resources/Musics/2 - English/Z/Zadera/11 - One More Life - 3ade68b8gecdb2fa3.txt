ONE MORE LIFE

The melody brought by the night
Intoxicates all sences in solitary hours.
The mourning head is lowering
Not found rest again.

Thick fog is falling to the earth
(Eye)lids are rising tired – just fading memorys
Wistful waiting for the night
See the dying day

Pain is eating at the freezing heart
Tears are rolling to the stars above the sky
The scent of roses floating on the graves
Again a life is crying to stay

Ref: Again a life is dying
In the search of life
The pain doesn’t wait
Till you escape from this night
