THROUGH THE PALE DOOR

Close your eyes
Forget reality
Just a second
Follow me, follow us


Forget reality
Now and here
Follow me to our past
Follow us to our life


Save your soul
For a dream
Try to fall
Follow me, follow us
 

For a little dream
Now and here
Follow us to the otherside
Follow us to our world
 

Close your eyes
Forget reality
Just a moment
Follow me, follow us
 

Forget reality
Now and here
Follow us to the labyrinth
Through the pale door
