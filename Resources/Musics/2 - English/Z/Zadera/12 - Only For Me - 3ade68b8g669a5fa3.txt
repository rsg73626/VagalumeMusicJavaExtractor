ONLY FOR ME

For a moment seen the sun
And then came the long black night
I tried hard to fight it
It was my fight only
And when I lost I laughed
 
Why?
 

My heavens are not yours
My love you would never understand
Each feeling I take differently
It was my life! And as I lost it
(I) Let myself go


Masked I step up to you
I’ve never shown you my real face
A new, a different life I’m looking for
Only for me
It’s for the best – I’d like to try it
Wether it’s better for me. I do not know
 

You will not get me
You will not catch up with me
It’s my life
I’ts only for me

… only for me …
