FALLEN

When the hate seduces my soul
Darkness comes into my heart
Now my my way goes along the abyss
Blade cut deeply in to my hand
- but I don’t feel any pain

An angel whispers my name
I look at him blind of tears
He gives me his hand
His light is shining black
- but I don’t feel any pain

Ref: Blood soaks my velvet dress
My Life runs out of my veins
An angel whispers my name

He pulls me up to let me fall into the flames
In memory to this wounds
Years pass by, dragging ahead
And let a dream into my life
-but I don’t feel any pain
