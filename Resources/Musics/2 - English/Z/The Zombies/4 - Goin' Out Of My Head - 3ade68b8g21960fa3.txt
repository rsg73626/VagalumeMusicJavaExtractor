GOIN' OUT OF MY HEAD

Well I think I’m going out of my head
Yes I think I’m going out of my head
Over you
Over you, well

I wanted to
To want me
I need you so badly
I can’t think of anything but you

And I think I’m going out of my head
(Out of my head)
Oh I can’t forget the tears that I shed
(Out of my head)
Over you
Over you, well

I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don’t even know that I exist

Going out of my head
Over you
Out of my head
Over you
Out of my head
Day and night
Night and day and night
Alright

I must think of a way
Into your heart
There is no reason why
My being shy should keep us apart

And I think I’m going out of my head
(Out of my head)
I can’t forget the tears that I shed

Going out of my head
Over you
Out of my head
Over you
Out of my head
Day and night
Night and day and night
Alright

I must think of a way
Into your heart
There is no reason why
My being shy should keep us apart

And I think I’m going out of my head
(Out of my head)
Yes I think I’m going out of my head

Going out of my head
Over you
Out of my head
Over you
Out of my head
Day and night
Night and day and night
Alright

Night and day and night
Alright
Night and day and night
