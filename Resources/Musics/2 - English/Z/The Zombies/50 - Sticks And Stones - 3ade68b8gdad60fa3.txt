STICKS AND STONES

People talk about breaking off
Can’t let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don’t bother me

People talk about breaking off
Scatter up my name
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I’ll never be the same

I’ve been abused
In my home
I’ve been abused
I’ve been abused right from the start

People talk about breaking off
Can’t let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don’t bother me
Oh, oh, oh

I’ve been abused
Out of my home
I’ve been abused
I’ve been abused right from the start

People talk about breaking off
Can’t let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don’t bother me
Oh, oh, oh

I’ve been abused
In my home
I’ve been abused
I’ve been abused right from the start

People talk about breaking off
Can’t let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don’t bother me
