IF IT DON'T WORK OUT

When she love me nothing in the world
Can touch her loving now
The light of love has gone
Can I return the joy she’s dreaming of
I don’t know
I don’t know

But if it don’t work out
The tears that I cried, babe
(If it don’t work out)
Won’t bring her home
(If it don’t work out)
If it don’t work out

Will she still care for me
The way she did before, well
She turned around and tells me
She don’t love me anymore
I don’t know 
I don’t know

But if it don’t work out
The tears that I cried, babe
(If it don’t work out)
Won’t bring her home
(If it don’t work out)
If it don’t work out

But if I could forget
The tears and the crying
That I went through 
Once before
Maybe my love, could start
Start again

One day I know we’ll find
The candle that we had
And I
Will know and feel
The joys and pleasures
That I’m dreaming of
And I don’t know
I don’t know

But if it don’t work out
The tears that I cried, babe
(If it don’t work out)
Won’t bring her home
(If it don’t work out)
If it don’t work out

But if it don’t work out
If it don’t work out
If it don’t work out
If it don’t work out
