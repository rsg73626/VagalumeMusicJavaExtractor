GOTTA GET A HOLD OF MYSELF

Girl I know you’re not coming back anymore
So why oh why do I keep on watching the door
I talk to you
As though you can hear what I say
But I’ll lose my mind
If I keep on acting this way

I’ve got to get a hold on myself
Got to make believe I don’t care
Got to go someplace
Find a brand new place
Got to get out and get somewhere
Got to get a hold on myself
Got to take what life has to give

Got to get on the track and lay down and die
Got to get a hold on myself

Late at night I hear footsteps sound down the hall
And I
Tell myself that you’re coming back after all
Telephone rings but there’s no one on the line
No, no, no
When I stop and think
I know it’s all in my mind

I’ve got to get a hold on myself
Got to make believe I don’t care
Got to go someplace
Find a brand new place
Got to get out and get somewhere
Got to get a hold on myself
Got to take what life has to give

Got to get on the track and lay down and die
Got to get a hold on myself
