IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME

If you wanna mess around, just stay away from my door
I've got a leak in my bucket & a great big hole in my floor
But if you wanna stay around & love me
You know it's all right with me

I've got no money, can't afford no big black car
My bank account won't see me very far
But if you wanna stay around & love me
You know it's all right with me

I'm sick & tired of bein' on my own
But you know, I'll take nobody who's gonna leave me tired & alone

(instrumental)

So you see, I can only offer a man that's poor
With frost & that & trouble at my door
But if you wanna stay around & love me
You know it's all right with me

Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo ooo
