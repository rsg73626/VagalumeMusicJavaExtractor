I COULD SPEND THE DAY

I could spend the day
Just laying here
Sweet beside you
Lazing time away
With gentle feeling of life

Would you want to hear
I would fall
Try said that I mean it

Sunlight gently cheers
Too deep, I sweep our eyes

So what do you say
The sun has started rising
Would you spend the day
Just laying sweet with me

I could spend the day
Just laying here
Sweet beside you
Lazing time away
With gentle feeling of life
