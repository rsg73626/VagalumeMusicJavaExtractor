SHE LOVES THE WAY THEY LOVE HER

She stands by the lights 
After put on the audience
Smile on her face, just taken into everybody

She loves the way they love her
(The love her)
She loves the way they love her
And she smiles
She loves every sweet talking line
Oh…

Then the smooth talking baby 
Blessed man from the management
Trips on the wire 
As he’s paying her a compliment

She loves the way he loves her
(He loves her)
She loves the way he loves her
And she smiles
She loves every sweet talking line
Oh…

She loves the way he loves her
(He loves her)
She loves the way he loves her
And she smiles
She loves every sweet talking line
Oh…

Crying, dying, sighing, whining, shining in the microphone
Dreaming dreams of future time 
While she and me are all alone

She loves the way I love her
(I love her)
She loves the way I love her
And she smiles
She loves every sweet talking line
Oh…

Running my hands through her hair
And knowing she’ll always be there

Oh, she loves the way that I love her
She loves the way they know she loves her
She loves the way he loves her
She smiles
She smiles
She loves the way I love her

Ooh, I love her, I love her, I love

She loves the way I love her
That’s the way I love her
