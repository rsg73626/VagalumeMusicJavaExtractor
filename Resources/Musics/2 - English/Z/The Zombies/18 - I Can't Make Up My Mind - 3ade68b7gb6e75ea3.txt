I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND

I can't make up my mind; someone has to help me
I never seem to know what to do; I just can't decide for myself
She has told me in so many words that she's still in love with me
& she wants me back, she wants me back with her again
She said, "Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I need you here
Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I want you by my side"

Someone show me which way to go; I need guiding in my choice
Of what to do; someone has to help me
