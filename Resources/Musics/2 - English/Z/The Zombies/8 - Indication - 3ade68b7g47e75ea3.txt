INDICATION

It's not that you're wrong, it's just that I am right
I don't want to be tied down every day & every night

CHORUS:
Now I've got an indication, I'll-hold-out-against sensation
I know that if i really try, I think I can hold out

If you think you've got me under wrong
You may be right, but I won't be the one to settle down

(chorus)

But if I can't hold out, keep away from you
I can see it happening, I will be with you

If it happens, there's nothin' I can do
I realize that you have won & it's no use to fight

(chorus x2)
