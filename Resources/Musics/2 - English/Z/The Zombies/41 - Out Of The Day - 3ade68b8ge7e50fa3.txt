OUT OF THE DAY

Out of the day
Into the night
Blinding burn, burning light
Shading my eyes
Into the sun
Hide the red, hide the sun
Driving home

I’ll soon be home

Feet are so gold
Reaching gown
Guild the road
Like a crown
Shadowy trees
Breaking the sky
Bind the day to the night
Driving home
I’ll soon be home

I will keep the wheels on turning till I’m there
Keep on driving through the sunset coma dare 
Till I’m there

Till I’m home
Driving home
I will keep the wheels on turning till I’m there
Keep on driving through the sunset coma dare
Till I’m there

Driving home
I’m almost home

Out of the day
Into the night
Blinding burn, burning light
Shading my eyes
Into the sun
Hide the red, hide the sun
Driving home
I’ll soon be home
I’ll soon be home
