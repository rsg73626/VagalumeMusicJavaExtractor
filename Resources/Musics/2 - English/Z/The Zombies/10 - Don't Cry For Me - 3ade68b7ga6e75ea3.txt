DON'T CRY FOR ME

Ah ah ah...
Don't cry for me
'Cause there's one thing I found out
I can live without you every day
& I'm better off with you far away from me

Ah ah ah...
Don't break your heart
Thinkin' you have let me down
In the light of day I can see what's real
& now I know what I really feel for you

(x2):
Ah ah ah...
If I'm wrong, you can smile & say I told you so
But I've got that feelin' that I found that you can lie, so
Don't cry for me
You will only waste your time
Thinkin' I'm in tears, for you're here no more
But the tears won't come, & I'll cry no more for you

Ah ah ah...
