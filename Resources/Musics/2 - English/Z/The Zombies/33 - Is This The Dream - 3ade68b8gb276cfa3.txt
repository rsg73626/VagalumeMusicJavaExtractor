IS THIS THE DREAM

Hey, hey, hey
I want to tell you something
So listen try to understand
Hey, hey, hey
If you continue to chase the sun
I’ll never be your man

I’ll count the times that I told you
You really shouldn’t try
And I told you
Cause baby you’ll just cry for a shadow
Believe me
Baby, baby, baby

Is this the dream you’re crying for
Is this the dream
Is this the dream you’re crying for
Is this the dream
Hey, hey, hey

I better warn you now
Someday you’ll find yourself alone
Hey, hey, hey

And life’s not pretty then
It’s ugliness will hide the sun

I’ll count the times that I told you
You really shouldn’t try
And I told you
Cause baby you’ll just cry for a shadow
Believe me
Baby, baby, baby

Is this the dream you’re crying for
Is this the dream
Is this the dream you’re crying for
Is this the dream

I’m going to do just how I feel
Don’t try to hustle me the way I feel
Hey, hey, hey

I’ll count the times that I told you
You really shouldn’t try
And I told you
Cause baby you’ll just cry for a shadow
Believe me
Baby, baby, baby

Is this the dream you’re crying for
Is this the dream
Is this the dream you’re crying for
Is this the dream

Is this the dream you’re crying for
Oh you can’t live with a dream
You can’t buy with a dream, oh
Is this the dream
Is this the dream you’re crying for
