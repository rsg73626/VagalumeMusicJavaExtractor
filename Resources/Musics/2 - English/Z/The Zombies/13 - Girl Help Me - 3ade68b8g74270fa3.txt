GIRL HELP ME

Last night I walked out to a darkening sky
I heard a sad song, and the song made me cry

Girl help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you

For when I was young with the fever of life
Your love cut my soul like a blade of a knife

Girl help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you

And when I take a look around to see what’s done
To see the sum of all that I’ve become
Then I see it’s true girl
There’s nothing there but you
(Oh girl)

Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you

And when I get to the dark at the end of the hall
I shout out you name but you don’t hear me call

Girl help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
Help me, I
I can’t think of nothing but you
