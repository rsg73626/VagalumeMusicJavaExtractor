NOTHING'S CHANGED

It's a mistake going back
They tell me that nothing's the same ever again
But when you walked through the door
It was just like before
Oh nothin's changed, no

When I saw you again, little girl
Something stopped here inside & I wanted to hold you
& tell you I loved you just like before

CHORUS:
Oh oh
This is just one day, but one day is enough to start all over again
Give me just one day & we will begin all over again

You didn't mean to hurt me before, but you did, you did
But now you're sorry now, I know
Oh you're sorry, I can see
'Cause when you saw me again
You smiled at me then
Like nothing's changed, no

(instrumental)

(chorus)

It's gonna be easy this time, I know, I know
Come on, just try me one more time
I know it's gonna work out just fine
Start all over, start all over again
