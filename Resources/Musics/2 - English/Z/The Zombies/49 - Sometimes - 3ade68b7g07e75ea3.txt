SOMETIMES

Sometimes I feel a little a little lonely
Well, don't you know that sometimes (I feel a little lonely)
& don't you know that sometimes (I cry at night)
But I just have to hold you (I just have to hold you)
& I know it's all right (I know it's all right)

(x2):
When I'm so happy when I'm with you
When I touch you, all my feelin's can't describe
All the love I feel for you
But I just wake up in the mornin'
& I wonder if this love is real
I've been hurt so many times before
But now I know, I know this love is real
Then sometimes I wonder (I feel a little lonely)
I really do (I cry at night)
But I just have to hold you (I just have to hold you)
& I know it's you (I know it's you)
