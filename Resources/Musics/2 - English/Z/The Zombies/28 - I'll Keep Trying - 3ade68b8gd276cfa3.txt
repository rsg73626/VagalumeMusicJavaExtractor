I'LL KEEP TRYING

In the night you’ll hear me crying
That’s because I’m sad that I’m away from you
If there’s something on my mind
Take no notice
No, I’m just trying to think of something else

If I weren’t, that’s my business
Anytime I want to cry
If I want to feed this sickness
Keep away from me
Cause I’ll keep trying till you come on home
(Keep trying)
Keep trying (keep trying)
Till my time has come
Keep trying till you come on home to me

You thought you could throw away
Everything I gave you just a say a word
Can’t you see that you were wrong
Can’t you see I knew how long you’d lied and cheated

If I weren’t, that’s my business
Anytime I want to cry
If I want to feed this sickness
Keep away from me
Cause I’ll keep trying till you come on home
(Keep trying)
Keep trying (keep trying)
Till my time has come
Keep trying till you come on home to me

If I weren’t, that’s my business
Anytime I want to cry
If I want to feed this sickness
Keep away from me
Cause I’ll keep trying till you come on home
(Keep trying)
Keep trying (keep trying)
Till my time has come
Keep trying till you come on home to me
