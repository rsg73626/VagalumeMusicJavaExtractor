WHENEVER YOU'RE READY

Oh I’ve been hurt
But I still love you
I’ve been hurt
Like this before, yeah

You’re not teaching me a new thing
Try to realize
And call me when you’re ready
Whenever you’re ready

I know you left 
But I still love you
And though I’ve cried like this before

You’re not teaching me a new thing
Try to realize
And call me when you’re ready
Whenever you’re ready

But if you call me
You’ve got to treat me in a different way
And if you call me
You’ve got to listen girl to what I tell you

I never hurt
Because I love you
Never hurt me like before, yeah

You’re not teaching me a new thing
Try to realize
And call me when you’re ready
Whenever you’re ready

You’re not teaching me a new thing
Try to realize
And call me when you’re ready
Whenever you’re ready

All you’ve got to do is call, call me, call me
You know
Call me, call me, call me, call me
Ready
Call me
