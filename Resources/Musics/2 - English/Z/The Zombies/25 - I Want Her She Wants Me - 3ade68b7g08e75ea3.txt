I WANT HER SHE WANTS ME

Released: July 1968

I close my eyes and soon I'm feeling sleepy
I sleep so easy
There's nothing on my mind
And life seems kind
Now, I want her she wants me

I walk downtown and as I look around me
All around me
The people smile at me
It's plain to see that
I want her she wants me

She told me to be careful
If I loved her
'Cause she had given her heart
Once before...

And now she knows she doesn't have to worry
I would not make her sorry
There's nothing on my mind
And life seems kind
Now, I want her she wants me

She told me to be careful
If I loved her
'Cause she had given her heart
Once before...

And now she knows she doesn't have to worry
I would not make her sorry
There's nothing on my mind
And life seems kind
Now, I want her she wants me

I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
I want her she wants me
