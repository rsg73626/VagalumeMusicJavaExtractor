CALL OF THE NIGHT

I was born when the sun 
Had gone from the sky
When the night had its rain 
And the day had gone by

Oh yeah
I hear the call of the night
Yeah
I hear the call of the night

And when I was young 
With the fever of life
The night cut my soul 
Like the blade of a knife

Oh yeah
I hear the call of the night
Yeah
I hear the call of the night

Can you hear it when it’s near
Like a larva without fear
Can you feel it
Can you hear

Oh yeah
I hear the call of the night
Yeah
I hear the call of the night

And when I am old 
And ready to die
I’ll fade as the sun 
Will fade from the sky

Oh yeah
I hear the call of the night
Yeah
I hear the call of the night
