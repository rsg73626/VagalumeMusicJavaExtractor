I'M COMING HOME

Well I’m going home
To see my woman
And I’m going home
To see my girl
Oh don’t you know
She really loves me
Oh don’t you know
She really cares

Yes I’m going home
To see my woman
And I’m going home
To see my girl
Oh don’t you know
She really loves me
Oh don’t you know
She really cares

She’s there to love me every night
And when she love me she love me right

I’m going home
To see my woman
I’m going home
To see my girl
Oh don’t you know
She really loves me
Oh don’t you know
She really cares

Oh, Oh

And when she love me she love me right

I’m going home
To see my woman
I’m going home
To see my girl
Oh don’t you know
She really loves me
Oh don’t you know
She really cares
