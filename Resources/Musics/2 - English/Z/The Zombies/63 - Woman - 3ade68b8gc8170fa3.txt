WOMAN

Woman
When I walked with you last night
My mind
Saw that you’d soon hold me tight

I can’t concede, no
I can’t believe you love me too

You don’t
Realize what you can do
I just sympathize but still it’s true

I can’t concede, no
I can’t believe you love me too

Woman
When I walked with you last night
My mind
Saw that you’d soon hold me tight

I can’t concede, no
I can’t believe you love me too

No, no, no

I want you to understand my mind
Seems that girls that do are hard to find

I can’t concede, no
I can’t believe you love me too
