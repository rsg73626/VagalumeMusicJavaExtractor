I DON'T WANT TO KNOW

If you can't find better things to do
Than tell me stories about her that you think are true
I don't wanna hear anything about her that's bad
I don't wanna hear anything that makes me sad
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know; you'd better turn around & go
I don't want to know

I don't wanna listen; I'm not gonna hear you
I believe what I want, no matter what you do
(x3:)
I don't care, don't want another word of anything you say
I don't wanna hear anything; you just keep away
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know; you'd better turn around & go
I don't want to know
