MAYBE AFTER HE'S GONE

Released: November 1967

She told me she loved me
With words as soft as morning rain
But the light that fell upon me
Turned to shadow when he came...

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, want me again

I remember joy and pain
Her smile, her tears are part of me
I feel I'll never breathe again
I feel life's gone from me...

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, want me again

All the days
And all the nights
Are time just passing by
And all the dreams I'm dreaming now
Hide the tears that I cry...

I feel so cold
I'm on my own
As the night folds in around me
Night surrounds me
I'm alone...

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, want me again

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, want me again

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back, love me again
After he's gone
She'll come back, love me again
