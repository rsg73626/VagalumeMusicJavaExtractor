YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO GOOD

You don't need any reason, do you baby?
Surely you should know that by now
But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you:
You make me feel good, you make me feel good

I don't need any reason when I hold you
I never do ask myself why
But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you:
You make me feel good, you make me feel good

CHORUS:
So good, so good, don't have to justify
Why I feel so good, so good, so good
Never thought could be so good to me

(instrumental)

But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you:
You make me feel good, you make me feel good

(repeat chorus & verse 1)
