CAN'T NOBODY LOVE YOU

Can’t nobody love you
Like I’m loving you baby
Cause they don’t know how
To love you like I do

Can’t nobody love you
Like I’m loving you right now
Cause they don’t know how
To love you like I do

I’m going to love you in the morning
Love you late at night
I ain’t going to stop loving you
Till you tell me everything’s alright

Can’t nobody love you
Like I’m loving you right now
Cause they don’t know how
To love you like I do

Can’t nobody kiss you
(Can’t nobody kiss you)
Like I’m kissing you right now little girl
Cause they don’t know how to kiss you
Like I do
(Can’t nobody love you)
And ain’t nobody that can talk to you
Like I’m talking to you right now
Cause they don’t know how to talk to you
Like I do

Listen now
Sam bought you cake and ice cream
Called you cherry pie
Ray Charles called you his sunshine
But you’re the apple
Apple of my eye, oh

Can’t nobody love you
(Can’t nobody love you)
Like I’m loving you right now
Cause they don’t know how to love you
Like I do
No they don’t know how
To love you
Like I do
