SUMMERTIME

It’s summertime
And the living is easy
The bees are jumping
And the cotton is high
Your daddy’s rich
And your mamma’s good looking
Would you hush pretty baby
Don’t you cry

One of these mornings
You’re going to wake up singing
There you’re going to spread wings
And take to the sky
But till that morning
Ain’t nothing, nothing going to harm you
With your mommy and daddy
There standing by

It’s summertime
And the living is easy
The bees are jumping
And the cotton is high
Your daddy’s rich
And your mamma’s good looking
Would you hush pretty baby
Don’t you cry
