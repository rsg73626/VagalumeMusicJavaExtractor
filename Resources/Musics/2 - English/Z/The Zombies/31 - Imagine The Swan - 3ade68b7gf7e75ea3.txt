IMAGINE THE SWAN

Released: May 1969

Well I have a picture in color of you
And it's there in my room to remind me of you
So it was with surprise that I saw you today
And I did not recognize you, girl, what more can I say?

For the colors are gone
You've become kind of gray
And you're not like the swan
That I knew yesterday...

Now the pictures are wrong
You've become kind of gray
I imagine the swan
That you were yesterday...

The sadness that I felt was hard on my eyes
And the truth on my face was hard to disguse
So I let you walk by
I turned out of your way
And I tried to close my eyes
And let the sadness fall away...

For the colors are gone
You've become kind of gray
And you're not like the swan
That I knew yesterday...

Now the pictures are wrong
You've become kind of gray
I imagine the swan
That you were yesterday...
