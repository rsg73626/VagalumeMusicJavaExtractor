I REMEMBER WHEN I LOVED HER

She seems so cold to me
And I remember when I loved her
She seems so cold to me
But I remember when I loved her

Now we are strange
No more in love
But I still wish
That I could hold her

My dream of love has gone
And I remember when I loved her

Now we are strange
No more in love
But I still wish
That I could hold her

My dream of love has gone
And I remember when I loved her
When I loved her
When I loved
Her
