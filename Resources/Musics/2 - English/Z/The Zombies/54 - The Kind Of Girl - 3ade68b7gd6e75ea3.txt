THE KIND OF GIRL

The kind of girl who says to me she doesn't want my love
Is not the kind of girl that you tell me I should be thinking of
But more of that another day
I've found another child to share with me
All of the pleasures that you've enjoyed

But don't you think that you're forgiven for taking her away
For if it hadn't been for your deceit, I'd be holding her today

(x2):
You think you've got everything
Just because you hold her in your arms & squeeze her tight
Don't you understand that she runs away
With anyone who happens in her sight
Oh you can't see how hard she is; you think you're very wise
But she will run away from you before you realize

She's gone, she's gone
