TIME OF THE SEASON

It's the time of the season
When love runs high
In this time, give it to me easy
And let me try
With pleasured hands
To take you in the sun to
Promised lands
To show you every one
It's the time of the season for loving...

What's your name?
Who's your daddy?
Is he rich like me?
Has he taken any time
To show you what you need to live?
Tell it to me slowly
Tell you what I really want to know
It's the time of the season for loving...

[Instrumental]

Tell you what I really want to know
