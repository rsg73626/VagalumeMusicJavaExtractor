THE LOOK OF LOVE

The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look
Your heart can disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more
Just words could ever say

And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You’ve got the look of love
Is on your face
A look in time can’t erase
Your mine tonight
Could this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let’s make a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Don’t ever go
Don’t ever go
I love you so
