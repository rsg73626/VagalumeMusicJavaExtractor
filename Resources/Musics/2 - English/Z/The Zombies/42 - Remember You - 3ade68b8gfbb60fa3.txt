REMEMBER YOU

I remember your face
When I think of this place
When I’m thinking back 
I’ll remember
When I’m far, far away
I’ll remember today
When I’m thinking back
I won’t forget you

And if I should change my mind
And I do sometimes
You know I do sometimes
I’ll come back to you

I’ll remember that smile
In your eyes all the while
When I’m thinking back 
I’ll remember
Comes a day when I’m down
My thoughts turn around
To when I last saw you
I can’t forget you

And if I should change my mind
And I do sometimes
You know I do sometimes
I’ll come back to you

And if I should change my mind
And I do sometimes
You know I do sometimes
I’ll come back to you

Remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember, remember, remember you
