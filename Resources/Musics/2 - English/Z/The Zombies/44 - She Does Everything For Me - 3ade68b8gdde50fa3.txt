SHE DOES EVERYTHING FOR ME

Hah!

There is nothing to say
It’s all been said
Now I’ve found a girl
That I love instead

She won’t leave me up with it
And tell me that she doesn’t care
About the way I feel cause I’m a fool

She does everything for me
(She does everything for me)
She makes me feel all right
(And though I know)
And everything she does for me
(Everything she does for me)
She makes me feel all right

Now you can say goodbye
And I don’t care
Do what you like
You can go anywhere
She’s the girl who makes me feel
That you’re not there to worry
I feel so good that I don’t care at all

She does everything for me
(She does everything for me)
To make me feel all right
(And though I know)
Everything she does for me
(Everything she does for me)
She makes me feel all right

She does everything for me
(She does everything for me)
To make me feel all right
(And though I know)
Everything she does for me
(Everything she does for me)
She makes me feel all right
