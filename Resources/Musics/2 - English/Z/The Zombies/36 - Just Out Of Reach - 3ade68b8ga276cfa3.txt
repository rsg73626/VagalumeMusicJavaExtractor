JUST OUT OF REACH

Just out of reach
Time has changed you
I can see
Try to remember how we used to be
Come on
Back to me

Just out of reach
Don’t stand back and you will see
Just how easy it can be
But you stand inattentively

Just out of reach
Time to show that I mean what I say
You’ll see, (you’ll see) you’ll see (you’ll see)
You’ll wonder why you doubted my work
When our love was meant to be

Come on home
You’ll be glad
Back here I won’t be mad
Funny you should be the one to make me feel sad

Just out of reach

Just out of reach
Time to show that I mean what I say
You’ll see, (you’ll see) you’ll see (you’ll see)
You’ll wonder why you doubted my work
When our love was meant to be

Come on home
You’ll be glad
Back here I won’t be mad
Funny you should be the one who make me feel sad
Just out of reach
