I MUST MOVE

You’ve known me now more than just a few days
And you think love is so good you want me to stay
But that won’t be any good (good)

No
I won’t stop or stay
And you must know it truth
Cause you can’t be in love
Yes you know what a proof

But I love you
And even if I do

I must move, I must move
And I can’t stand still
I must move, I must move
I must go

Take a good look at yourself and at me
Turn right around opened eyed
You will see
When this day is through
I’ll be leaving you

I must move, I must move
And I can’t stand still
I must move, I must move, I must go

No, no
You’ve known me now more than just a few days
And you think love is so good you want me to stay
But that won’t be any good (good)
