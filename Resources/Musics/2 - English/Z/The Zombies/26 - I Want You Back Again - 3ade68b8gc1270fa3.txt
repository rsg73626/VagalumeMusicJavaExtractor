I WANT YOU BACK AGAIN

Somebody help me
I’ve got to eat
Somebody help me
To stand on my feet

I want you back again
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back again

Since you have left me
I’m all alone
I need your help, I
Can’t stand on my own

I want you back again
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back again

Since you have left me
I’m all alone
I need your help, I
Can’t stand on my own

I want you back again
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back again

I want you back again
Oh, oh, oh
I want you back again
