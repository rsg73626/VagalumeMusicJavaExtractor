HOW WE WERE BEFORE

The party’s over
Don’t break it
Gradually through on us
Shows us
How we were before

Why we waited
Been so lonely
Continually lone to be
Again
How we were before

And as you waited for me
We will be together
And as you’ve waited for me
I’ll leave you again
Never ever

So remember we were lucky
Mercifully turned to be again
How we were before

And as you waited for me
We will be together
And as you’ve waited for me
I’ll leave you again
Never ever

So remember we were lucky
Mercifully turned to be again
How we were before
