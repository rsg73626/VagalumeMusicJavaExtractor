IT'S ALRIGHT

Say it’s alright (it’s alright)
It’s alright (it’s alright)
It’s alright
Have a good time
Cause it’s alright

Oh it’s alright
We’re going to move it slow
When the lights are low
When you move it slow
Sounds like a moan
And it’s alright

Whoa it’s alright
Now listen to the beat
And kind of pat your feet
You’ve got soul
Everybody knows
That it’s alright
Whoa it’s alright

When you wake up early in the morning 
Feeling sad like so many people do
Have a little soul
Make life your goal
And surely something’s got to come to you
Wake up to say:
That it’s alright

It’s alright
It’s alright
Have a good time
Cause it’s alright

Whoa it’s alright
Now everybody clap your hands
If you want to stand a chance
Yeah you’ve got soul
Everybody knows
That it’s alright
Oh it’s alright

Someday I’ll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
Then my road has got to go
My woman should know
Morning noon and night
She’s got to say
It’s alright
It’s alright

It’s alright
Have a good time
Cause it’s alright
