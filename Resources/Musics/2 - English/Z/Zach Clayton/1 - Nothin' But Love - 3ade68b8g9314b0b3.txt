NOTHIN' BUT LOVE

Don't care what people say
Not taking any l's today
I shine a light on all the shade
'cause love is in my dna

I'm always doing it big
I ain't afraid to be bold
Ain't afraid to be loud
Don't always do what I'm told
Always keeping it real
Whether you like it or not
Ain't got a care in the world
'cause love is all that I got

I ain't trying to pretend
To be nobody else but me
You can think what you wanna think
But I'm just doing me

I keep a smile on my face
Wearing a frown ain't my style
Nothing but love in this place
And if you hatin' you wild

You can think what you wanna think
But I'm just doing me

I don't care what people say
Not taking any l's today
I shine a light on all the shade
Cause love is in my dna

And you know I'm about that
You know I'm about that
You know I got
Nothing but love
And you know I'm about that
You know I'm about that
You know I got
Nothing but love

I got that l-o-v-e
Nothing but love
I got that l-o-v-e
Nothing but love
I got that l-o-v-e
Nothing but love
I got that l-o-v-e
Nothing but love

I don't care what people say
Not taking any l's today
I shine a light on all the shade
'cause love is in my dna

And you know I'm about that
You know I'm about that
You know I got
Nothing but love
And you know I'm about that
You know I'm about that
You know I got
Nothing but love
