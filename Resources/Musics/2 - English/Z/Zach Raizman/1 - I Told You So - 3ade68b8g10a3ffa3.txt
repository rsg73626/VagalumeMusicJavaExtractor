I TOLD YOU SO

I know you've got these good intensions
I know you've got these good intensions
I know you think with all your heart it's gonna work

But I don't see this moving any further
And I dont want to make this any harder
I don't wanna be the one to say

I told you so
I told you so
I told you sooo
I told you so
And don't please

How good things soon come to an end
Its a fact of live you've gotta understand
I'm not saying anything you don't already know

I just wish you could take my advice
You've got this fight and just get on with your life
I don't wanna be the one to say

I told you so
I told you so
I told you sooo
I told you so
And don't please

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
