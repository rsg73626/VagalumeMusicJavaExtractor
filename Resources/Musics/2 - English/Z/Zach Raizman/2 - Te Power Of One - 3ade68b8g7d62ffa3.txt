TE POWER OF ONE

In this world
That carries no guarantees
What type of life to lead
Or who your suppose to be

I believe
Live life without regrets
Laughter's a gift were blessed
Happiness is success

I know the risks I take
Stand my grounds
And keep the faith
I'll see this through till the very end
I never will give up

In my dreams
I see the power of one
I feel it in all your love
I see it in everyone
In my dreams
I see the power of one
I feel it in all your love
I see it in everyone
In my dreams...

This to me
Is where I'm suppose to be
Its everything I believe
The world lives in harmony
I have seen
The difference in you and me
The difference for all to see
I'm with you and your with me

I know the risks I take
Stand my grounds
And keep the faith
I'll see this through till the very end
I never will give up

In my dreams
I see the power of one
I feel it in all your love
I see it in everyone
In my dreams
I see the power of one
I feel it in all your love
I see it in everyone
In my dreams...

This life I try to lead
Someday I think we'll achieve it all...

In my dreams
I see the power of one
I feel it in all your love
I see it in everyone
In my dreams
I see the power of one
I feel it in all your love
I see it in everyone
In my dreams...
