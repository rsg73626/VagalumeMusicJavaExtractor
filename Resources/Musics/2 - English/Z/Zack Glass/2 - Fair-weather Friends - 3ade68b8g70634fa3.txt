FAIR-WEATHER FRIENDS

Fair-weather Friends
They only stick you when they got the bends

When they´re feeling down
Watch how they come & stick around
When they´re feeling blue
Watch how they call upon you

When you need them around
Seems they´re nowhere to be found
When you´re lost & confused
They don´t wanna have nothing to do with you,
no no

Fair-weather, fair-weather, fair-weather friends

Talking

When you´re feeling down, ain´t got no one around, on town
Ain´t got no friends
