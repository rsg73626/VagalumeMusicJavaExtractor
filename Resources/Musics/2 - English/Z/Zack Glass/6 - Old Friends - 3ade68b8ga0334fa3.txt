OLD FRIENDS

Old friends, they never never let you down
New friends, they pass & they´re not around
Old friends, they stick with you ´till the end
New friends, they want everything for them

I remember
Those days after school
Me & my bredren
We broke all the rules

New friends come & go
They´re only there for the show
Old friends will endure
You always have their word

Old friends, they never never let you down
New friends, they pass & they´re not around
Old friends, they stick with you ´till the end
New friends, they want everything for them

Jigging for mackerel
Ain´t sound bad to me
sitting down by a camp fire
On the island Margaree
We be going down to Piper´s glenn
To see old Jim
Watching shooting stars all night
and we feel alright

Old friends, they never never let you down
New friends, they pass & they´re not around
Old friends, they stick with you ´till the end
New friends, they want everything for them
Old friends, there´s nothing like old friends, come on
Old friends, there´s nothing like old friends
Old friends, there´s nothing like old friends
