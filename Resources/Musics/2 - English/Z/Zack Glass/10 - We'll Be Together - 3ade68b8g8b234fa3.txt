WE'LL BE TOGETHER

I´m walking over, to see my baby, and i
Know that we´ll be together
We´ll be together

And talk is cheap, lover´s leap, the earth is deep,
So is my love for thee
We´ll be together

A cause for celebration, and there´s no hesitation,
No no no, there will be
Nothing but elation

Nothing but elation

And round we go
Fast or slow
And boats we row
This is our show

We´ll be together
In any kind of weather
From january until december
Until december

Just call my name
I´ll be on my way
And day by day
You don´t have to persuade

We´ll be together (3x
And we´ll be together

we´ll be together
And we´ll bear the weather
Rainy days in december
And I´ll be writing you from back home
And I don´t want to be alone, I´ll be carrying my load
And I´ll be waiting fou you by the side of the road
