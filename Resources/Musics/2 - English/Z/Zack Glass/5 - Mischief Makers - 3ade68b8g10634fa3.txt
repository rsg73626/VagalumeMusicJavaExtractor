MISCHIEF MAKERS

Oh, Mischief Makers
You bean up to no good

´Cause I know
And I say
Just go along
Go along on your way

You been disturbing my peace
And I don´t, rest so easily
You never respected me
Now you playing, happy go lucky
Your not happy

No no no no
You been up to no good

You got too much time on you hands
And now your making your litlle foolish plans
I´ve been hearing about your rumours
All the time
I´m not blind
And you´re not kind, no no no

Mischief Makers
Yeah, yeah

You been trying to spread untruths
Your behaviour, is so uncouth
You been talking behind my back
and I know this behind my back
And I know this to be a fact
wisdom is what you lack, litlle ones now

Mischief Makers, yeah, yeah
And they are fakers, yeah, yeah
Mischief Makers, yeah, yeah
And they are fakers, yeah, yeah
