THE DAYS OF INNOCENCE

The days of innocence are gone (4x)

We used to be so free
Playing on Waikiki
Not a trouble in the world
Just like little boys & girls

The days of innocence are gone (4x)

I´m travelling on the road up north
And I´m watching the coast to coast
I´m going to visit an old friend
and our hearts we will mend

The days of innocence are gone (4x)

We´re living in a different world
And the thieves have stolen our pearls
Not too much hope for mankind
´Cause hatred has made us so blind

The days of innocence are gone (4x)

The days of innocence 
Are gone gone, are gone, are gone, are gone gone
are gone
