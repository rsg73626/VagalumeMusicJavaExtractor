DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND

And I´ve been down here on the ground (x2)

I don´t know where to go
And I´ve bean moving kinda slow
And I´ve got to carry a heavy load

Last year nothing came with the rain
And it sems like nothing much has been changed

I still feel the pain
And not much did I gain
But thank goodness we still got the rain

Down here on the ground

The winter will be coming soon
We´ve got to make some room
My baby she´ll be coming home pretty soon

And I bean trying to follow my dreams
But the more I try is the harder it seems
Somethings I have to let go
I´m still gonna try some more
And I´ll keep on knocking knocking at that door

Down here on the ground
