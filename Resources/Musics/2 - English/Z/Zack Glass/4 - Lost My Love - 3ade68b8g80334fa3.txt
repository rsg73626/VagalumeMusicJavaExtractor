LOST MY LOVE

Said I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
And I lost my love over there

Said I been down
And I been around
I never found a love like yours
I had to pass on through the next door

´Cause I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
And I lost my love over there

Said I been the clown
And I´ve seen you wear your frown
Bitterness was my only friend, yeah
But I´ll love you ´till the end

´Cause I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
And I lost my love over there

Times like these were hard
When you struck me with your love sword
I thought it would be the end, yeah
I had to come around the next bend

´Cause I lost my love over there
And I lost my love everywhere
Lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
I lost my love everywhere
I lost my love over there
I lost my love over here
I lost my love, I said I love her like that
You know I love her like that
Lost my lover over there...
