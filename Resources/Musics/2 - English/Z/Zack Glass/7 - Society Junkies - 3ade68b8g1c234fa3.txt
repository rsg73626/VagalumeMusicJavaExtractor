SOCIETY JUNKIES

I see them Society Junkies laughing their lives away
I see them Society Junkies having their litlle play
Watch them Society Junkies laughing their lives away
I see them Society Junkies having their litlle play

They are carefree they don´t know what they wanna be
They´re laughing on the outside and they´re crying on the inside
They think that alive is to walk so much pride

Oh yeah

They look at me like I´m strange, to me they are deranged
They act like they´re merry in truth they are contrary
The truth it is so plain and should really be ashamed

They drink their night away, promises for a change
And when the morrow comes, it´s only themselves to blame
They´re strung out on society and everithing is make belive

Oh Yeah

I see them Society Junkies etc...
Laughing their lives away (repeats)
And tehy´ll be laughing their lives away
Laughing their lives away
