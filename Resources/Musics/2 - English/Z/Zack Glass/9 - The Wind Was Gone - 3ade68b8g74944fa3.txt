THE WIND WAS GONE

Baby
She left when the wind gone
My baby
She left when the wind was gone
Baby
She left when the wind gone
My baby
I said she left when the wind was gone

She´s a thousand miles away
And I still think of her on those rainy days
I see a storm on the horizon
Love strikes like lightning
No no no no

She left when the wind gone
I´ve seen you round town
I know what your thowing down
I´ve seen you on the street
We going way Downtown
Now now now

And I know tha I´ll see you one day
And I know you´ll be coming my way

She left when the wind gone

But I know that I´ll see ou one day
And I know that you´ll be coming my way

She´s coming back again
she´s coming home again
she´ll be coming back again
she´ll be coming home again

Coming home again home, Coming home again home home,
come home again
She´ll be coming home again home home
Coming home again home home
