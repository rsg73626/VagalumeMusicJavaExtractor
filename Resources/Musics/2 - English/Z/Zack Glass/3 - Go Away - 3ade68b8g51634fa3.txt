GO AWAY

(Inspired by events that accurred on sep. 11, 2001 & written on the same day)

So many lives lost
And for what is the cost
Who´s really the boss
Mankind is at a loss
What a tragedy
I see so much misery
People were crying
So many people were dying

And go away, and go away
Wickedness go away
And go away, and go away
Sorrow go away
And go away now

I could feel their pain
Their horror and shame
Some were commended for bravery
Souls perished by wicked infantry
separated by loved ones
And sorrow is sung
And I see a new day
The battle is not yet won

And go away, and go away
Wickedness go away
And go away, and go away
Sorrow go away
And go away now

What´s in store for the future
But I don´t know
I feel dark days may be coming
We gotta go
And I´ll know my way

We need solidarity
In this catastrophe
Things will never be the same
Fear & hatred are ones to blame
And we have been maimed
On that terrible day
Now we cannot delay
´Cause this is not a game

And go away, and go away
Wickedness go away
And go away, and go away
Sorrow go away
And go away now
Just go away now, I said go away now
You better go away now!
