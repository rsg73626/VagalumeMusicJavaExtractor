UNTITLED 1

Buried in ashes
Head to my toes
I got a secret I'm keeping
And everyone knows
I got a world full of idols
And a head full of hair
And the thoughts that are in it
Just float through the air
Leave me alone
I'm safe at home
Pressing your buttons
Blowing my cover
Parts that are hidden
Search and discover
Breaking me down
To find my genetic makeup
I just fallen asleep
I wish I could wake up
Leave me alone
I'm safe at home
Leave me alone
I'm safe at home
Leave me alone
I'm safe at home
