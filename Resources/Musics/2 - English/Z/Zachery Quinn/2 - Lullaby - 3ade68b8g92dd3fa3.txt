LULLABY

I'm on the couch, nervous and cold
The infomercial's getting old
A lullaby is what you want
A lullaby is what you got
I will be the one who walks you home
And know that I will the one who ends up alone
A lullaby is beautiful
And so are you, you're wonderful
A lullaby is what you want
The lullaby I never got
She is the only one keeping you sane
Know that she will be the easy one to blame
