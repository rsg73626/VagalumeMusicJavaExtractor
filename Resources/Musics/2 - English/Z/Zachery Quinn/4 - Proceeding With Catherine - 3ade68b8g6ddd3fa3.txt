PROCEEDING WITH CATHERINE

Proceeding with Catherine is a dangerous road to walk
'Cause she's cold and still and she paints her will
Alone in her bedroom hands covered in chalk
You know she must inhale the dust to talk
I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted someone to be a friend
And though you still seem willing
I know better than to trust you again
Fooling me twice would be a sin
Proceeding with caution is a difficult way to be loved
I know it's safe, my kind of place
What's the worst that could happen?
Could slip and fall back into the night
She's sinking in our hearts again
Trust
I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted someone to be a friend
And though you still seem willing
I know better than to trust you again
Fooling me twice would be a sin
