PAPER TRAIL

With a closet full of space,
And some memories erased,
All I asked for was some change.
Brain cells still all rearranged.
Jst a tiny paper fee.
Important men look up at me.
An offer to which you can't say no;
Handed off the vile and here we go.

The poison in my body is the poison in yours.
You cannot have the treats unless you do your chores.

Cherry toppings for us all.
Unfamiliar doors lining the hall.
You don't know where you are
But you aren't lost.
There's full consent despite the cost.
A padded playground full of love.
A man is lurking up above,
Shaking his big head at me,
But I don't need him so leave me be.

The poison in my body is the poison in yours.
You cannot have the treats unless you do your chores.
I've never heard "I love you" less sincere,
But just a paper trail is what has led me here.

The poison in my body is the poison in yours.
