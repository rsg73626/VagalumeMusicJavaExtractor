CUDDLING WITH DAISIES

I'm cuddling with daisies,
In a flower's bed.
I'm living in a small town
Somewhere in my head.
I'm shelling out excuses,
Like you deal a deck of cards.
If you're the queen of diamonds,
I'll shatter you to shards.
I'm a tourist.
I'm a waste of time.
I'm yours.

I'll live and die for today if you take me away.
Preferred customers shouldn't have to pay.
Baby take me away.

Now I'm a glass of spoiled milk,
Spilled all across the floor,
And I don't need your pity.
Don't cry for me no more.
My baby's got a burden.
I always said I had a name.
I'm walking out on Bourbon
where getting drunk is just a game.
I'm a tourist.
I'm a waste of time.
I'm yours.
