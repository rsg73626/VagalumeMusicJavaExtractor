ZAK1 FT. SON RAY

Son Ray:
You are listnening to the mind of a leftist/
Rhymes eplileptic/
Shaking up the game, where's my mind, oh I left it/
Lines steady flying at the minds of these skeptics/
Flows sick, like I'm doing lines of asbestos/
Infectious, they say they did the crime and got records/
Its funny, they only do the crime on their records/
Type to be like yo I got the nine nigga check it/
And I be like no nigga no I dont respect it/
Your lying. Everything about you is legit/
I dont believe you a bit I wouldn't doubt your a bitch/
Type of nigga that will run his mouth full of shit/
Fuck your couch you can sit on a box full of dicks, fag/
I put up money that I bet he takes a liking to it/
They see me doing me and they like maybe I can do it/
Im like dynamite with the wick tied into it/
BING! dont let the fire hit while Im spitting lighter fluid/
You can try to do it, I dont think that you'll prevail/
Theres only so many times that you can beat a nail/
You see I see it well, no need to see or smell/
Or to call a columnist and tell them that you'll never see me fail/
I'll do a 3-12 before you ever see me flop/
I'm not these other dudes Im a different breed of hop/
I guess I need to stop traffic headed westbound/
Son Ray and Zak1/
You rocking with the best now

Chorus: Nowadays good music falls on deaf ears
Repeats

Zak1:
See nowadays these cowards never do as these cowards say/
Them coward ways got me walking with a sour face/
Respect where respects due/
What will you do when them real goons check on you?
Reflects on you/
Think you fly as me? Flyswatter/
Firestarter but lines still cold as icewater/
Cut they wind short and now they can barely breathe/
Im in this game where street credibilitys became a rarity/
We wavy baby uh make a hater sea-sick/
You see my offense will keep you on your defense/
Roll the dice player you could bet your life on it/
Until the night ends, the flows high end 
so you probably couldnt put a price on it/
Them bitches all bugie/ 
So theyre skeptical/
Because I never stick to them/
Like my schedule/
Im off the medical shit I even got a card/
I see these rappers in thier videos acting like theyve got it hard/
Ive got game to hypnotize you/
Stop your grind in one day/
One way or another, cover your back, Son Ray/
Zak1 boy watch me metamorphisis/
No competition/ 
Can only show you where the corpses is/
You rappers need to soul search/
I got no fear/
One way trip, no way back, and you dont want to go there/
You dont want to go near, so fresh Im like next year/

nowadays good music falls on deaf ears

Chorus
