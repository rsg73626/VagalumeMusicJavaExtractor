LIVING THE GOODLIFE (FEAT. CHINX DRUGZ, HOLLYWOOD HAITI, TL CROSS)

Because I live that street life
I hustle living the good life

All this bread that I touch got me feeling like a baker/
And I hold my city down like I tossed out the anchor/
Dipping on low profiles probably with your main squeeze/
Put mileage on her, she rode me like a 10 speed/
Money all the time, bullshit to the side/
The shoes groovy on me right? Boy they aint your size/
Dipping in that 2012 on these niggas coattails/
Made her sign a waiver before I hit so she wont tell/
Coke Boys nigga got the city under seige/
Game in my palm bad bitches on their knees, Kevlar
M Double, 40 glocc cop killers/
Headed for the top with your bitch, Godzilla

Chorus:
It goes money, cars, girls, clothes, God, block, tours, shows
Hey! this is the life homie you see the chain shine, you gotta get yours homie because Im going to get mine
Because I live that, street life, I hustle, living the good life

Im super sour looking down on the streets/
I hit the studio and lay the murder on the beats/
Hollywood! Respect my handle/
The boy been cooking why you think she wants a sample?/
I wont stop, though them haters hope Id flop/
See that Shakedown stamp know we headed for the top/
Is that all? And the rest is all basic/
Money Im going to chase it, the love I embrace it/
Bad bitches taste it, and treat me like a patient/
Im in the club every night getting wasted/
Im in the VIP throwing signs like a Mason/
Fast life yes Im living like Im racing/

Repeat Chorus

My flows hot and yours been cold/
My dough stretch out ten fold/
My shades low, my patience thin no warning shots youve been told/
Your talking big, but Im looking down/
When the guns go off and the bullets hit you have no one left boy look around/
Money talks when the bullshits done, lets see who follows through/
I turn the tide and watch your so called goons follow suit/
Create a buzz while staying real, look at the time it took/
Whoever said the game stays the same needs to re-write the book/
I switch lanes hand me the rock and watch me run with it/
In this thing ready for fame and all that comes with it/
Perfect the craft, these haters dont have the stomach/
If your not talking money you arent really saying nothing/

Repeat chorus
