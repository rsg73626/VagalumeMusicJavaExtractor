BLUE SKY (FEAT. CAELU)

Hey, you're the bright light sun that's warming life
And taking over us
Wait, feel my heart beat off my chest
Before my feelings fade, cause

Days are passing by my eyes
And I can't find you anywhere
But still I try
I'm
Still trying to be everything you want
But after all this time

You have to thank every time you see a blue sky
Oh oh oh
Cause' right now
You can't see clear even if I
Give you my life
Oh oh oh

Wait, feel my heart beat off my chest
Before my feelings fade
Cause'

Days are passing by my eyes
And I can't find you anywhere
But still I try
I'm still trying to be everything you want
But after all this time

You have to thank every time you see a blue sky
Oh oh oh
Cause' right now
You can't see clear even if I
Give you my life
Oh oh oh
