PART OF ME (FEAT. JONNY ROSE)

Come on let me take you away from all the drama tonight
I know a place we can go
Where everything will turn out alright

Where you can open up
And tell me all your stories
I'm losing touch
And I need your glory

Hey! Don't I know you
From somewhere in a dream
Hey! Don't I know you
You're the other part of me

You're always a part of me (Always a part of me)
You're always a part of me
You're always a part of me (Always a part of me)
You're always a part of me

A part of me

Every time the tears fall I will be the one who is there
You got me waiting till the last call
Just so I can capture your stare

Want you to open up
And tell me all your stories
I'm losing touch
And I need your glory

Hey! Don't I know you
From somewhere in a dream
Hey! Don't I know you
You're the other part of me

You're always a part of me (Always a part of me)
You're always a part of me
You're always a part of me (Always a part of me)
You're always a part of me

A part of me
