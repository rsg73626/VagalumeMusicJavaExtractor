SUMMER BREAK (FEAT. ARIEL)

I don't care where you are from
Just don't want to you to be gone
Forever young like a summer Sun
Baby I'm the son of the summer

I don't care where you are from
Just don't want to you to be gone
Forever young like a summer Sun
Baby I'm the son of the summer

Baby I'm the son of the summer
Baby I'm the son of the summer
Baby I'm the son of the summer
Baby I'm the son of the summer

Baby I was born in the summer
Baby I was born in the summer
