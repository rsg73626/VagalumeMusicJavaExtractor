NOT AN ANIME

(It's) Not an anime, not an anime,
It's true.
In the night when everybody was wrapped in sleep,
I looked at the sky through the window,
And I saw such a great thing.

All adults say with a laugh,
'You watch too much television',
But I never ever
Tell a lie.

Our world
Cannot be looked into
Through the glasses of common sense.
You old Earthians who forgot dreams.

Not an anime, not an anime,
A lovely world,
Not an anime, not an anime,
It's a reality,
Not an anime, not an anime,
A wonder feeling,
Not an anime, not an anime,
It's true.

Sneaking out of the room at dawn,
I kept on waiting on the beach,
And I saw such a great thing.

Every time I have a secret talk,
People say 'You read too much manga',
But I never ever
Tell a lie.

Don't forget
The world cannot be measured
By the rules of common sense.
You old Earthians who forgot dreams.

It's true, it's true.
