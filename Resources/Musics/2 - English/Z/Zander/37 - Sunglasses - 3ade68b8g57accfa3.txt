SUNGLASSES

How can time be such a bastard?
How long can you be blind?
But sometimes there is a light
Funny how she looked pretty that night
Was the first time I had to wait 'till two a.m.
And it was fine
Neither cigarretes or smoke could overshadow her smile

Just for being amazing
Just for being a normal girl
Who needs to be wherever to find herself
And nobody can say where she belongs

Daily jobs can be so boring
Getting tired of working at night
Never thought it would be easy
Away from parents and home

But something still makes her eyes
Shine all night and day
And we know there are not many
Willing to follow their hearts

Just for being amazing
Just for being a normal girl
Who needs to be wherever to find herself
And nobody can say where she belongs

Paths cross in a strange way
And time was not so bastard in the end
Stay firm and the world will be yours
Or at least what matters, sweetheart

Just for being amazing
Just for being a special girl
Who needs to be wherever to find herself
And nobody can say where she belongs
