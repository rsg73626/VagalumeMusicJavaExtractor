HEARTSTRINGS

A thousand years or so it seems
We're tied by blood and love
In this lifetime, in the past, promises everlast
I've seen your face so many times, it brings joy and pain
Whether we've been close or apart
These memories remain
Overcast and out of light, I pray for some hope of dawn
If I could remember your song, love never gone

I'm losing you once again, I'll take care of you
Just like you did when I was young, hold your hand

You touch me, you pull my heartstrings
Will I emerge from the deep that drowns me?
Someday I'll feel the sun shine on these dreams
Then I'll know there's a place I can breathe

If I could manipulate time, I'd stretch it out for you
Take the time to thank the one I've always looked up to
Push away your silence, to hear your laughter once again
Keep you warm through the night for a smile or a glance

Did my heart just skip a beat, you're fading fast for me
"Fides, per semper, " gives myself belief
"Skyrocket through the universe
Shade winking stars, that far
The seventh day, the seventh week
On earth, a great rebirth. "

I'm losing you once again, I'll take care of you
Just like you did when I was young, hold your hand

You touch me, you pull my heartstrings
Will I emerge from the deep that drowns me?
Someday I'll feel the sun shine on these dreams
Then I'll know there's a place I can breathe
