QUID PRO QUO

Everyday we stomach what the men on the Tv fabricate
Ransackers, marauders, murderers, kidnappers
Prey on our fears, make us choke on insecurities

We shit, we spit, we stick it out
Wrongdoers they're all the same, lowlife scum
Whether they're upper, middle, or lower class
Won't take it anymore

We remember our fallen
They had their lives stolen
I'm the law in this lawlessness
With the grace of God

Quid pro quo, you know the score
No mercy now, execute 'em all
Quid pro quo, down on the floor
From this earth, we wipe 'em out

Everyday we digest the dealers' disguised gameplay checkered out on the streets
Hiding behind juvenile criminal liability
We see police shifting sands, as the guns trade hands, our state reinstates
Won't take it to the grave, won't take it anymore

Everyday we swallow as the politicians pocket kickback
Organizing crime into export quality
Jailed schools of extortion, as the slums grow out of proportion
Won't take it to the grave, won't take it anymore

They've point-blanked our well-being
It's time to intervene
I'm the law in this lawlessness
With the grace of God

Quid pro quo, you know the score
No mercy now, execute 'em all
Quid pro quo, down on the floor
From this earth, we wipe 'em out
