SOVEREIGN

I am just one more man
A namesake to defend
Born from the cracks of the land

Before I lay me down
I'll find some means in town
Wherever this river may flow

Arriving but staying no more
My trade's to reap and sow
This town reaps profit from death

Against a bullet born free
A man stood in her path
So her children could soar

In this wretched life today
There is nothing but decay
And now I see it's exactly as it ever was
I may try to run away
It's no different if I stayed
In the end we're only fading to dust

These crossroads may bring me to you
I must seek out

And as you come to birth
Blood turns misery around
Nodding against a handful of "no"s

Then you pace the roads
The shore halts your search
Live in slime, bury yourself dry

Follow your own funeral
To the sea in a swift ride
Into the rivers you should've dived

And as you leave this earth
You earn your plot of land
Grave for emaciated bones

In this wretched life today
There is nothing but decay
And now I see it's exactly as it ever was
I may try to run away
It's no different if I stayed
In the end we're only fading to dust

These crossroads may bring me to you

In this wretched life today
There is nothing but decay
And now I see it's exactly as it ever was
I may try to run away
It's no different if I stayed
In the end we're only fading to dust

These crossroads may bring me to you
Each breath I'm closer to my last
By your sovereign decree
This too shall pass
