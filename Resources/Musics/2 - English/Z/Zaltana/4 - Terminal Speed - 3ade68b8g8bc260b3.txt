TERMINAL SPEED

I feel ablaze, filled with desire
Burning up, I'll walk the wire
Tear the walls down, against the gray, 10000 miles
My wings can soar far away from your gaze

If this is real, never go back to the mass
Filled with self hate
Draining the world of earthly ties, don't understand
You never will, how I feel, I'm the only one

I'd wish it all evaporate, I've seen you crawl
It kills me

Won't you feel my pain
Could we please end this now
An end to suffering

Wheels float on an endless sky
These curtains closing on my life

It feels so sweet, plastic retreat
Impregnating grooves on my skin
Where I could sink, field of grass
Every blade pricks, seconds to tick
Rushing this terminal speed

Then come with me, suture the homes
Severed millions, give us some hope
Be there for me when I fall
We'll make it through if we stay true
To ourselves, there's nothing else

I'd wish it all evaporate, I've seen you crawl
It kills me

Won't you feel my pain, could we please end this now
An end to suffering

All that the heart perceives
And sees as beauty must be truth
