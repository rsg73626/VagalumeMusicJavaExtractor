SILVER SCREENS

She had a smile that could light up the room in seconds
I got lost in her blue eyes in conversation
And she told me her dreams and she trusted in me for hours
I held her hand and whispered away my secrets

Nothing's like it seems, it's all a make believe
And no one's really listening
Too blinded by the glare to ever stop and care
Yeah, no one's really there when you need them
So hold on to who you are
'Cause nothing's like it seems, it's all a make believe
Just falling stars on silver screens

She had a smile that could light up the room in seconds
With tears after midnight, she told me she lost direction
While the world was asleep, she was up telling me it was over
I held her tight for a moment and I was speechless

Nothing's like it seems, it's all a make believe
And no one's really listening
Too blinded by the glare to ever stop and care
Yeah, no one's really there when you need them
So hold on to who you are
'Cause nothing's like it seems, it's all a make believe
Just falling stars on silver screens

Last thing I heard, she became a star
Followed her dream, she followed her heart
She left a message in the middle of July
Said you were right and I realized

Nothing's like it seems, it's all a make believe
And no one's really listening
Too blinded by the glare to ever stop and care
Yeah, no one's really there when you need them

So blinded by the glare to ever stop and care
Yeah, no one's really there when you need them
So hold on to who you are
'Cause nothing's like it seems, it's all a make believe
Just falling stars on silver screens
