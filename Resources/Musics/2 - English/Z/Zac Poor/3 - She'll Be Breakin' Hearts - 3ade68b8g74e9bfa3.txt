SHE'LL BE BREAKIN' HEARTS

Red dress first name basis
One touch got you naked,
oh fall to the floor
Dark eyes heavy breathing
daylight caught you
leaving, oh
You never spoke

Late night wonder
undercover love she's on the 
run
She'll be breakin' hearts
She'll be taking them down
She'll be  killing in a cold
dark corner of love Oh I
know nothing bout'

She'll be breakin' hearts
One kiss'll knock you out
You'll awaken with your
chest wide open
The pieces laying all around
She'll be breaking... hearts,
hearts

Slow pulse cold & lonely
She's hot to the very core
I lock every door
Her smile It's infectious
Beware It's a weapon don't..
Don't bring her home

Cold cold lover takes another life
she's out there tonight

She'll be breakin' hearts
She'll be taking them down
She'll be  killing in a cold
dark corner of love Oh I
know nothing bout'

She'll be breakin' hearts
One kiss'll knock you out
You'll awaken with your
chest wide open
The pieces laying all around
She'll be breaking... hearts,
hearts

hide your hearts and cover
any signal that you love her
never say you need her,
she will come and will and
hunt you down (hide your
hearts guys, hide your
hearts guys)

hide your hearts and cover
any signal that you love her
never say you need her,
she will come and will and
hunt you down (hide your
hearts guys, hide your
hearts guys)

She'll be breakin' hearts
She'll be taking them down
She'll be  killing in a cold
dark corner of love Oh I
know nothing bout'

She'll be breakin' hearts
One kiss'll knock you out
You'll awaken with your
chest wide open
The pieces laying all around
She'll be breaking... hearts,
hearts
