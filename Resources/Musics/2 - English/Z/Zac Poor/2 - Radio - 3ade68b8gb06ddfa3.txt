RADIO

I stare with the TV dark
I would see you face if I turn it on
A week wouldn't pass the time
In every magazine you're the main headline

I've been thinking about you
Can't stop dreaming about you
I can't get you out of my head

Oh, oh
I hear your voice in every song on the radio, oh
Can't turn you off
Sure going crazy, I can't take it
Can't escape, you're everywhere I go, oh
Oh oh
On the radio

Stop, you're always on my mind
In every single face on every billboard sign
I stay, better stay away
It's up on every chart
With every song they play

I've been thinking about you
Can't stop dreaming about you
I can't get you out of my head

Oh, oh
I hear your voice in every song on the radio, oh
Can't turn you off
Sure going crazy, I can't take it
Can't escape, you're everywhere I go, oh
Oh oh
On the radio

I feel you all around
Inside in every sound
Getting lost but then you're found
And oh, oh, oh, oh

One two
One, two, three, four

Oh yeah, yeah

Oh, oh
I hear your voice in every song on the radio, oh
Can't turn you off
Sure going crazy, I can't take it
Can't escape, you're everywhere I go, oh
Oh oh
You're everywhere I go, oh
Oh, oh
On the radio
