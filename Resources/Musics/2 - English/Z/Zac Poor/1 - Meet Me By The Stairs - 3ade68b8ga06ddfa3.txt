MEET ME BY THE STAIRS

There's something in the air, whispers everywhere
Telling me to move on
I hear it in the trees, whistling on the leaves
Picking up on what's wrong
And I'm all alone

I feel it in your stare, nothing's even there
Tell me is it all gone?
I find it in the streets, the way it drops the beat
Writing you a love song
And I'm all alone

And I'll sing my heart out
'Til I have no breath and my voice is silenced
I'll sing my heart out
'Til there's nothing left and I have lost it all

Meet me by the stairs, tell me all your fears
I'll try my best to be strong
I need a second chance, not anther glance
Well how did you move on so fast
And I'm all alone

I'll sing my heart out
'Til I have no breath and my voice is silenced
I'll sing my heart out
'Til there's nothing left and I have lost it all

I feel it in your touch, a sudden sense and rush
Why do I hold on?

I'll sing my heart out
'Til I have no breath and my voice is silenced
I'll sing my heart out
'Til there's nothing left and I have lost it all

Meet me by the stairs, tell me all your fears
Writing you a love song
