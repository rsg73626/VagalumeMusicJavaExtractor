MISS TROUBLE

You know my last name is trouble
So get out now
Because if we are together
Will be forever
You'll not be separated from me never
I will not let that happen
You'll hate me
More than anything
Till one day point a gun at me

You are a canqueror cheap
And I'm a crazy desguise
You have a long list of bitches
And I suicide valentines
You saw me sitting on the balcony
And came thinking I'm another
But you don't know
I've had my eye on you before
I'm trying to control me
But you're not letting me
Concetrate
Is better not get so close
Why you are coming so close?
This game have thousand shades of grey

You know my last name is trouble
So get out now
Because if we are together
Will be forever
You'll not be separated from me never
I will not let that happen
You'll hate me
More than anything
Till one day point a gun at me

You already know what my fame
And yet still want to try
Nothing will be the same
I'll meet you at the altar
And if you have a lover
I'll find it, I'm a great stalker
Don't worry, you don't have that to watch it
I will beat her and cut her
I will drown her and kill her
Baby, you wiil be mine
And no one else
I will love you so hard
Until you love me so hard
You should to know I never stop
I can't stop

You know my last name is trouble
So get out now
Because if we are together
Will be forever
You'll not be separated from me never
I will not let that happen
You'll hate me
More than anything
Till one day point a gun at me
Oo
Till one day point a gun at me
Yeah
Till one day point a gun at me
