BEST COMPANY

( Verse 1 ) 
I was just sittin there and she came up and said to me 
Besides a drink do you want some company 

( I said you can ) 
Take a seat but there’s a party on down the street 
How bout you come 
There’s some people there you autta meet 

( there we like to ) 
Play beer pong baby 
All night long maybe 
So if you think you got game 
Lets get it on” 

( this is the land of ) 
Fake ID’s 
We smoke, trees not weed 
and everybody knows somebody who can get you what you need 
I said get you what you need 

( Chorus ) 
As long as you bring me all your 
Love love love love love love 
Give me all your love love love love love love 
I will give you all my love love love love love 
Its gonna get us what we need…to be 

( Verse 2 ) 

We sat down on the back yard patio 
Did a shotgun, drank a beer and smoked a bowl 

( I told her I ) Like to call her 
my small town beutey queen 
instead a dress she where’s a tank top and faded jeans 

it was 5 mintues till midnight 
we saw some headlights then we 
saw some jersey kids beat some ass in a fist fight 

people always be 
talking shit, so we represent because 
this is where your from not just where you live 
you know we’ll only let you in 
if your bringing all your 

( Chorus ) 

Love love love love love love 
Give me all your love love love love love love 
I will give you all my love love love love love 
Its gonna get us what we need…to be 

( Verse 3 ) 

( Someone yelled ) 
the cops are here everybody put down your beer 
there in the front use the back to get out of here 

( we flew ) 
across the yard over the fence and into the street 
sound of feet on the concrete screaming out “police” 

( These cops got ) 
Nothing to do 
But to mess with you 
( So they ) 
throw there weight around 
like they got something to prove 

(soon the cops gave) 
up there chase 
so we made our way to the 
back yard table to meet up for a lil late night blaze 

I said aren’t you glad you came 
She said how bout we go and make some 

( Chorus ) 

Love, love, love, love love love 
Give me all some 
Love love love love love love 
That’s why we bring our 
love love love love love love 
It will get you what you need
