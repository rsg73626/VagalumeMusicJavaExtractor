BARS

( Verse 1 ) 

Rain falls heavy, on the roof while we sleep 
Don’t forget me, don’t forget me when I leave 

( Lead In ) 

Before love I, 
was so cold inside I 
Can’t picture now My 
life before you 

We can lay on the couch and 
Talk about or 
Sit at the bar all night 
I’ll sit back with a beer 
While you drink your wine… 

Because sometimes now, all I want to say 
Do you ever feel this way… 

( Chorus ) 

That there’s nothing I’d rather do, then lay in bed with you 
Just give me something, and I’ll give you more 

All my thoughts on love before, 
I can’t wait to push out the door 
So I can be there for you 

( Verse 2 ) 

I can still taste your kiss on my lips 
There’s no one I’d rather be with more than you 
( and you never know )when Love will sneak and softly whisper in your ear 
( it will say with me ) things are se-cret-ly more than they appear to be…so anyways 

Lets finish these beers and 
Get out of here to 
The nights sky that 
hangs above the street light 

In my mind where 
Your all the time I’ll 
Walk you to your door 
Goodnight kiss has never been this good before 

That’s why sometimes now, all I want to say 
Do you ever feel this way… 

( Chorus ) 

That there’s nothing I’d rather do, then lay in bed with you 
Just give me something, and I’ll give you more 

All my thoughts on love before, 
I can’t wait to push out the door 
So I can be with you 

( Bridge ) 

I take back everything that I did 
I was wrong 
If I called out your name 
Would you still walk away 

( B Section ) 

And don’t fear love 
Don’t hide away 
Your not the only one 
that’s scared of love in some way 
You got to break down these walls 
Because you are so afraid to fall in love with 
Anything that remotely means anything at all…to you
