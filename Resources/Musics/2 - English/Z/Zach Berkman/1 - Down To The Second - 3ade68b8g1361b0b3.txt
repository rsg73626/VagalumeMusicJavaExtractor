DOWN TO THE SECOND

I know what I want
I know what I want
I want a long life, all kidding aside
the rules are the same
as they always were
present's a thought
and a piece of mind
and I want my girl in my arms when I sleep
breathing in her dreams
near the air I breathe
and I wanna dream

right down to the minute
right down to the second
I can feel my every breath unfold
right down to the minute
right down to the second
I'm down to the seconds

steady little boat
steady little boat
take me to the shore
take me to the shore
take me back home all the way to where I'm from
to the banks of the Illinois
show me the house I was raised in
and the woods where I used to play
steady little boat
take me home cause I'm far away

right down to the minute
right down to the second
I can feel my every breath unfold
right down to the minute
right down to the second

right down to the minute
right down to the second
I can feel my every breath unfold
right down to the minute
right down to the second
and I'm down to the seconds

out on this tiny planet
under a bright yellow sun
on an island
east of an island
just past the bridge and tunnels
I feel the ground under my shoes
on a street between a couple of avenues
and I'll lose it

right down to the minute
right down to the second
I can feel my every breath unfold
right down to the minute
right down to the second

right down to the minute
right down to the second
I can feel my every breath unfold
right down to the minute
right down to the second
right down to the minute
right down to the second
I'm down to the seconds
