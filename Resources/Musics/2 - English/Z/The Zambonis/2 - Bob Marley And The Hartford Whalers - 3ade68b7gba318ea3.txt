BOB MARLEY AND THE HARTFORD WHALERS

I remember hockey games 
played right here in my state
that's where all the people came for their local team

those days are still around, unfortunately not in my state
support it can't be found
it's in the press, and now we're all depressed

Bob Marley and the Hartford Whalers
are not around
Bob Marley and the Hartford Whalers
have left town

imagine New York without the rangers
Philly without the flyers
no Detroit red wings

so go to games
support your team
and while you're there ya buy ice cream
let em' know you care
if everyone does their part
the team won't break your heart

Bob Marley and the Hartford Whalers
are not around
Quebec's nordiques and the golden seals
have left town

the Rockies and the north stars
have both disappeared
so support your team, while we just dream
of our golden years

support your team!
let's dream about our golden years!
