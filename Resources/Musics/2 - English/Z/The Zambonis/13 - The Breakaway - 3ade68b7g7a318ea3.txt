THE BREAKAWAY

When your a defenseman
they are defenseless
their teeth is unprotected

and the crowd
They grow restless
They basically expect it

The Breakaway
The Breakaway
The Breakaway
Steal the puck
Pass it up 
and Break a Breakaway

When I'm standing
on the blue line
Power Play
I must be careful
when I shoot
Not to give the puck away

The Breakaway
The Breakaway
The Breakaway
Keep your head up
Steal the puck 
and Break a Breakaway

Breakaway

It doesn't matter if your on the ice playing hockey
In school taking a test
or up on stage trying to remember the words to your new song
Sometimes the pressures on
That's when you got to look inside. Focus
And put a five hole. Yeahhh

The Breakaway
Steal the puck
shoot it up 
and Break a Breakaway

1, 2, 3,

Keep your head up

and Break a Breakaway
