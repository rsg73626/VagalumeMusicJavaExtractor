I WANNA DRIVE

Well I went down to my local arena. 
I asked to see the manager man. 
He came from his office and said, "Son can I help you?" 
I looked at him and said, "Yes you can." 

'Cause I wanna drive the zamboni. 
I wanna drive the zamboni. 
(Yes I do.) 

Since I was young it's been my dream 
to drive that there zamboni machine.
I'd get that ice just as slick as could be, 
and all the kids would look up to me. 

'Cause I wanna drive the zamboni. 
I wanna drive the zamboni. 
(Yes I do.) 

The manager said, "Son, I know it looks keen, 
but that right there is one expensive machine. 
And we've got Smokey who's been driving for years." 
About that time, I broke down in tears. 

'Cause I wanna drive the zamboni. 
I wanna drive the zamboni. 
'Cause I wanna drive the zamboni. 
I wanna drive the zamboni. 
(Yes I do.)
