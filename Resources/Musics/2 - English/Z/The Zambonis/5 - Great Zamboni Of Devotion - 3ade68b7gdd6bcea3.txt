GREAT ZAMBONI OF DEVOTION

Seems I wait all day for this.
Dare I dream for just one kiss?
Feels like I've been banged against the boards.
The zamboni goes round and round.
Stomach just won't settle down.
I've been here 100 times before.

I want to ride that great zamboni of devotion.
For it will make those feelings disapear.
And your love would be nice
while the zamboni goes around the ice.
That great zamboni is you my dear.
Skates and sticks and bloddy teeth.
Hockey fans all spit on me.
They hook, they slash, and tear me up to bits.
Meanwhile I'm just standing here.
Raise my fist and down my beer.
Now I'm at the end of my wits.

I want to ride that great zamboni of devotion.
For it will make those feelings disapear.
It's the price that I pay
for those hockey head games that you play.
That great zamboni is you my dear.

I want to ride that great zamboni of devotion.
For it will make those feelings disapear.
Oh how I wish
I could be the mustard on your conish.
That great zamboni is you my dear.
