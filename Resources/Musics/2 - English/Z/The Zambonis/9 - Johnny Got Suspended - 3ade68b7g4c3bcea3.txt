JOHNNY GOT SUSPENDED

A long time ago
my friend Johnny got suspended for wearing
an 'Islanders Sucks' t-shirt.The teacher said to him,
"Young man, you will report to the office
and talk to the principal there."

The principal said to Johnny,
"I'm ashamed.
Where's your brain
to wear such a slogan in a public place?
I called your mom.
There she is right now. She said,

"Johnny...
What can I say?
I'm in a state
of dissarray.
You will be punished,
that's for sure.
But your father says he's proud
and the Rangers rule!"

Johnny

for wearing
an 'Islanders Sucks' t-shirt.
Oh yes he did. (x4)

Johnny

an 'Islanders Sucks' t-shirt.
Oh yes he did. (x8)
