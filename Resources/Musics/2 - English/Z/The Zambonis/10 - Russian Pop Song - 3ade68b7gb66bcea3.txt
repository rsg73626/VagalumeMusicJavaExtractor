RUSSIAN POP SONG

Sergei...
at a young age made a decision.
His friends called him a traitor and a quitter.
(You'll be American Degenerate)
But little did they know
this gave him power to go on
and go on...

Alexi...
had the same dream as his comradto live free and play hockey.(So what'd they do?)
They took the train to the Ukrain,
and they took the plane to Pittsburg, PA.
In the USA.(In the USA)

Sergei and Alex made a bid decision.
Times have changed so they go back and visit.
They see old friends and family,
and procede to tell the stories...of life
in the NHL,
in the USA.
(And Canada!)
in the USA.
