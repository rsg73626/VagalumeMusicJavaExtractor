SLAPSHOT LOVE

skating by the blueline
that's when I saw your green light
so I took my wind up for slapshot love

slapshot love
slapshot love
slapshot love 
into my heart

so I went running
without my skates on
then I fell for slapshot love

slapshot love
I wanna slapshot love
slapshot love through my heart

put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light for me

put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light for me

well I've been skating a little in a v?
skating all night long trying to
improve my game
I've been skating here all night
skating all day all night
waiting till the morning light...
and slapshot love

slapshot love
slapshot love
slapshot love 
into my heart

slapshot love
I wanna slapshot love
slapshot love into my heart

put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light for me

put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light
put on the red light for me
