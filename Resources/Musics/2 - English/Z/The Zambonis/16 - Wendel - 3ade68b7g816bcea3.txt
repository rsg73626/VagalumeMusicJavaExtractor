WENDEL

A lot of people say he is bad.
A lot of people have a lot to say.
From the couch, it might look easy.
Wendel Clark, he's okay.

We don't really care what they say,
'Cause in our book Wendel Clark's okay.
I watch on TV, I feel the pain.
So Wendel Clark, Wendel Clark's okay.

I saw him take down Kovalev.
He put an elbow into his head.
I saw him cheap shot Jeff Beukeboom.
I guess it just wasn't his day.

We don't really care what they say,
'Cause in our book Wendel Clark's okay.
It took some time to heal the pain.
But Wendel Clark, Wendel Clark's okay.
We don't really care what they say,
'Cause in our book Wendel Clark's okay.
I watch on TV, I feel the pain.
So Wendel Clark, Wendel Clark's okay.
