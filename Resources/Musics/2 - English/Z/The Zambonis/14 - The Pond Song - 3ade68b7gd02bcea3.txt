THE POND SONG

Crack of dawn I call my friend.
"Keith, have you checked out Ketchel's pond?"
He calls up Tommy Teller.
Tom says the pond, it froze right over.

So get the nets and lace your skates.
And get the hard chocolate, put your moans away
'till we get old.

(Hey!)

Crack of dawn, I call my friend,
"Hey Tarkin.""Yeah Dave."
"Hey, have you checked out the pond today?"
"It's funny you ask, I was just down there this morning."
"Yeah, any good news?"
"Well Dave, the pond..."
"Yeah?"
It's froze right over.
Get the nets and lace your skates.
And get the hard chocolate, put your moans away
'till we get old.
