AWAY GAME

Get on the train, it takes me away
Not gonna see you for awhile
Why?
It’s an away game, it’s an away game
I’m coming home soon

Get on the train it takes me away
Not gonna see you for awhile
Get on the train it takes me away
I’m coming back to you in style?
It’s an away game, it’s an away game
It’s an away game, another away game
I’m coming home soon

But don’t you worry
It’ll be alright
Cause we’ve got four home games in a row
Starting thursday night
Together again, just me and you
No more away games
Just us two
Just us two
Just us two
Just us two...again
