DREAMS OF NOTHING

The wind with the sadness of my being
Burning the earth of the future crimson
With the seventh gate of the seventh zone of the battles
Riding through the on this earth
Where reigns dreams of nothing and penetrations of pain
From divine fornication of my embryonic words
Is the power of my sword is the earth caress my soul

For my powerful hate I go among the multitudes
For my mind then the sky cries dreams of anything

Who’s the torture and the thunder of my dreams
Who’s the torture and the thunder of my wings

Who’s the angel of the rage which reality is insecure
When I close my dreams with the blood in my eyes

Who’s the torture and the thunder of my dreams
Who’s the torture and the thunder of my wings

I see the way toward horizon
Of empty dreams
Lost in dream of nothing

The cementery of the time
Thinks my punishment
And the pain of eternity
I go for the for the memory
Of the twilight
Fear leaves I get read on the destiny
And see after mirror
Touching my face in the land of tranquility
