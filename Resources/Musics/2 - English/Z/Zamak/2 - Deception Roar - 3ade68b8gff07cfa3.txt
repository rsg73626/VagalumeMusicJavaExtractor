DECEPTION ROAR

Where the sepulcher drinks all
When the stars attack me

The ride of the hope
Suffering the deception of the past
In own corrosion
Carving about the solitude
And the pleasure of pain

The poison running in the real sadness
With my veins it controls my mind
Pulled with a biological hate

A deception a lament
Toward the end or the lunacy

Thatâ€™s maybe the destruction of my feelings
The demons punish my heart

I was waiting for love
Punished by the madness of hate
That arises from the ashes of the imaginations
With aggressions without control

No !!!!deception of reality
Unchained a powerful cry
I hear a roar in my silence
and I trust in a whisper of solitudes
that it bleed from me they cry for me
they cry from me they scream for me
