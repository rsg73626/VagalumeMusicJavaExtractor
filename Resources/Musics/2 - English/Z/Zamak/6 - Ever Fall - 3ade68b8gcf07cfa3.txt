EVER FALL

One more time feel lost
in the hands of the pain
walking with sorrow
my being blessed
with crimson tears
oh pleas lady give me the liquid
and kill forever

ever felling the fall
in the eyes of the autumn

ever felling the end
with your hateful love
wanted to find my sins
in the lost sky
wanted to find my being
in the deep of your love

oh please give me the liquid
or kill my heart
with pleasure I wait
your sour words or your sweet love

yes I am the sick warrior that
looks through your eyes
but everything
you had done in eternal time

ever felling the fall
in the eyes of the autumn

ever felling the end
with your hateful love

yes I go forever feeling the fall
oh please give me the liquid
and kill forever.
