END OF INNOCENCE

He comes burning the deception of innocence
Sad and blind when the demons bleed on you
Your tears will fall on the answer of the pain
Where a long time there was a heart

Wild arms embracing calling to the rage
Trying to decide to close our suffering
Calm swims the fear ridding on the wind
you just know that you don’t know anything

storm of lies you cry on the perfection of souls
six feet lower human flesh punished by the abuse
frozen by the hands of the twilight
calling the nauseous pestilence

The smile of a buried boy
Create a paradise
That never existed
Enslaved frozen under a command
Before the punisher’s arms
Controlling in my mind
But the fear inside of you

Wild arms embracing calling to the rage
Trying to decide to close our suffering
Calm swims the fear ridding on the wind
you just know that you don’t know anything
