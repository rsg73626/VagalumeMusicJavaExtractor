DEAD CARESS

It’s my death
And death caress is here

Yes it’s my tears
And my hate sprouts
Such a spring in the soil
Feeding the flame of the life

Yes it’s my death
Pleased, walking
Caress by the wind
Dead fall down

Wide and green river
Shining like mirror
Empty as me searching for feed
The soul the spirit

Celestial being enlighten my way
Hiding which death
To be so sweet like that lips
As cold like ice
As pungent like that eyes
so smooth like that hair
so direct like that arrow

Yes it’s my death
Pleased, walking
Caress by the wind
Dead fall down

Wide and green river
Shining like mirror
Empty as me searching for feed
The soul the spirit
