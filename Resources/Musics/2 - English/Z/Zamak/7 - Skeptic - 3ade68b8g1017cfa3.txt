SKEPTIC

There is that man
Looking in my interior
Traveling in the spaced
running through my blood
jumping for my veins

alone I want to walk
without cease toward that cosmos
that he gets excited these winds
that it dazzles tonight

she didnâ€™t want this after
that outbreak
who torment the boldness
of to leave me and to forget
in this promised land
in the dark and sweet darkness

there is that man
without fear and stammering
to order, to destroy, and defy

waste and sweet world with pain escapes
with impulses we are not able to hope
already now

alone I want to walk
with the arms already bleed
crossing this immense full moon
I no longer wish to see behind you
