CHAIN BREAKER

If you've been walking the same old road
for miles and miles
If you've been hearing the same old voice t
ell the same old lies
If you're trying to feel the same old holes inside
There's a better life
There's a better life

If you've got pain
He's a pain taker
If you feel lost
He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving
He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you've got chains
He's a chain breaker

We've all search for the light of day in the dead of night
We've all found ourselves
worn out from the same old fight
We've all run to things we know just ain't right
And there's a better life
There's a better life

If you've got pain
He's a pain taker
If you feel lost
He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving
He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you've got chains
He's a chain breaker

If you believe it
If you receive it
If you can feel it
Somebody testify

If you believe it
If you receive it
If you can feel it
Somebody testify, testify

If you believe it
If you receive it
If you can feel it
Somebody testify

If you've got pain
He's a pain taker
If you feel lost
He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving
He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you've got chains
He's a chain breaker

If you need freedom or saving
He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you've got chains
He's a chain breaker
