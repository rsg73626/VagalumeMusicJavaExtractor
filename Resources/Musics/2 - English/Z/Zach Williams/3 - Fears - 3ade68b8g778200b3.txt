FEARS

Pacing by the front door,
Leaving for the city
Horses eat the grass,
'tells them tomorrow's another day
Gone before too long,
Papa tried to one
"boy, you leave this home,
And you won't find a place"
'stays warm in the sunshine,
Building falls, time flies
Piecing the picture back here
When you're ready for a change

In this place for her,
In this place for you,
In this loving world,
And deeper truth

Take me to new york or keep me
It doesn't matter if you're here,
Beside me, without the fears of this world

Yeah,
Walking out the front door,
Leaving for the city,
Grabs his bags
And tells him that tomorrow,
Just my final one,
More than just rent a space
Closets full of no place,
Thinking less of gate, train and trees,
We might find a better song before too long
Money spent; food gone,
Loving or ey,
I could do, and baby,
We've got money for shoes

In this place for her,
In this place for you,
In this loving world,
And deeper truth
Place for her,
Place for you,
Loving world,
Deeper, deeper...

Take me to new york or keep me
It doesn't matter if you're here,
Beside me, without the fears of this world
Take me to new york or keep me
It doesn't matter if you're here,
Beside me, without the fears...

Take me to amsterdam
Take me to mississippi
Take me to baltimore
Or budapest or brooklyn
Or jerusalem
It don't matter if you're here, no,
It don't matter if you're here,
Beside me, without the fears,
It don't matter if you're here, now,
It don't matter if you're here
Beside me, without the fears,
Beside me, without the fears, no,
Beside me, without the fears, oh,
Of this world
