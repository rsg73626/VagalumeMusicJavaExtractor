DOWN TO BLOOD

Facing the crowd that could see through my lies
As I stand under streetlights that glimmers and shines
On the things I keep quiet, the things I need close
The things that keep me up and haunt me the most

But it's too soon to know
You're too far to know who I can not be
And it's too close a call
So do I just hope I can go on living with no one knowing who I am

I wish I could scream
And I wish I could write
Faults on all of the walls that I keep trying to hide
From faces that smile, the one face that might forgive me if I shine all the dirt in my life

But it's too soon to know
You're too far to know who I can not be
And it's too close a call
So do I just hope I can go on living with no one knowing who I am

I will go down
Down, down, down, down
I will go down
Down, down, down, down
I'll go down to the water
Down to the water, down to the water, down to the water
Down to the blood rushing blue on the water (5x)
Down

But it's too soon to know
You're too far to know who I can not be
And it's too close a call
So do I just hope I can go on living with no one knowing who I am
