THE STRUGGLE

He woke up this morning
To an angel in his bed
There was a devil in the bottle
He was holding in his hand
With his head still full of whiskey
And his eyes now full of tears
He opened up a Bible that he hadn't read in years

And he said
I am tired I am torn
And I can't take it anymore
You see this bottle has been my only friend
But here I am my heart to you I give
Oh father can you take away these tears

She struggles with addiction
She struggles to fit in
She takes too much medication
Just to cover up the tears
One pill to make her happy
Too many make her sad
Then she notices a Bible in the hotel by her bed

And she says
I am weary I am worn
And I can't take it anymore
You see this bottle has been my only friend
But here I am my heart to you I give
Oh father can you wash away these sin

Then the sun came up and the sky turned blue
And the pain they knew was gone
And as the old life died A new life it was born
It was a life they never knew

Until they followed you
