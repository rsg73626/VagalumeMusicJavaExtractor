WHO HE IS

Lay your arms down brother
There is no need for fighting anymore
The stones that you been throwing
You know you will be held accountable for

There is no judge nor jury
There is a higher power
The son of God a savior to us all
And he can wash you clean, white as snow
But there's a world outside that doesn't know... Who he is

So leave your burdens sister
There's no need to hold them anymore
Your cross was already carried
So leave your troubles at the feet of our Lord

There is no judge nor jury
There is a higher power
The son of God a savior to us all
And he can wash you clean, white as snow
But there's a world outside that doesn't know... Who he is

That he died so we might be set free
And all our sins could be washed clean
That there is power in the blood
And his grace and mercy covers us

That by his stripes we have been healed
And we can do all things through him
The son of God he live
The son of God he lives

There is no judge nor jury
There is a higher power
The son of God a savior to us all
And he can wash you clean, white as snow
But there's a world outside that has to know... Who he is
