SHINE A LIGHT

Once I was running
Lost and alone
I thought I could make it just fine on my own
Living for glory my fortune and fame
But all of these things were never enough

Shine a light on me
Shine a light on me
Keep on shinning

I was lost in the valley
In the shadow of sin
With darkness around me wherever I went
But you showed me mercy
I felt your love and your grace
And I knew right then how the lost found their way

Shine a light on me
Shine a light on me
Keep on shining

Every morning and every night
Wherever I am lord I know you? re gonna shine your light

Shine a light on me
Shine a light on me
Keep on shining
