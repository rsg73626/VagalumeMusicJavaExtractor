WASHED CLEAN

Father open up my eyes
So I might truly see
Everything you have done for me
Lord I'm tired and I'm torn
My face is on the floor
Break these chains and set me free

Lord I wanna be washed clean
Don't you know I wanna be washed clean

Father take away my pride
Just set it all aside
So I might hear what you have to say
Lord I'm tired if all my guilt
I'm tired of all my shame
Break these chains and set me free

Lord I wanna be washed clean
Don't you know I wanna be washed clean

Cause I been living a lie that I just couldn't see
And holding on to things that I just didn't need
But you took these hands and washed them clean
Oh like a blind man lost in the middle of the night
You came down and you opened my eyes
And I won't ever be the same

Oh that's what Jesus
Jesus did for me
Solo over verse
So now I've opened up my eyes
And swallowed all my pride
I finally let you lead the way
And I fall down on my knees
I'm just a Brother of your Grace
And I won't ever be the same
