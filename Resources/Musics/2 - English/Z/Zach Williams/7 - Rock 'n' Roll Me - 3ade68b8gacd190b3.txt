ROCK 'N' ROLL ME

I've been sneaking around your window baby
Im Like a cat out on the prowl
Got an itch that needs some scratching
Got the feeling you know how

Rock n roll me while you stone
With a word you whisper in my ear
Take it slow and take it fast
Take your time let's make it last
That's what were gonna do

Ive been laying around your tree
You've been shaking leaves at me all day
Drop a rope down for me babe and let me
See if can help you shake some on my way

Rock n roll me while you stone
With a word you whisper in my ear
Take it slow and take it fast
Take your time let's make it last
That's what were gonna do

Ahh you know that's what were gonna do
Rock N Roll me while you stone me
