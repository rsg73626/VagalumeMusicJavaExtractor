JESUS TAKE MY HAND

I wanna live in a world that has no shame
Nobody hurts or feels no pain take my hand
I wanna be baptized in all of your glory
Know what it's like to tell your story take my hand

Jesus take my hand I wanna know your plan
Lord I want to worship you
I need to feel your grace and mercy on this place
Jesus all I want is you

You pick me up when I fall down
You gave me promise for a life I never knew I had
You are my shelter from the storms
Lord in my darkest hour I know you are always there

Jesus take my hand I wanna know your plan
Lord I want to worship you
I need to feel your grace and mercy on this place
Jesus all I want is you

And even though I struggled to surrender
You never went away
Your mercy and your love will last forever
And I wanna know you more each day


I wanna live in a world that has no shame
Nobody hurts or feels no pain take my hand
I wanna be baptized in all of your glory
Know what it's like to tell your story
take my hand
