OLD CHURCH CHOIR

There's revival, and it's spreading
Like a wildfire in my heart
Sunday morning, hallelujah
And it's lasting all week long

Can you hear it?
Can you feel it?
It's the rhythm of a gospel song
Ohh once you choose it, you can lose it
There ain't nothing there
ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

I got an old church choir
singing in my soul
I got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful
I've got a heart overflowing
cause I've been restored
There ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

When the valleys, that I wander
Turn to mountains that I can climb
Oh, you are with me, never leave me
Oh cause there ain't nothing there
ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

I got an old church choir
singing in my soul
I got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful
I've got a heart overflowing
cause I've been restored
There ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
No there ain't nothing gonna steel my joy

Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Till you find that gospel beat
Cause it's all you'll ever need
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Till you find that gospel beat
Cause it's all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need

I've got an old church choir
singing in my soul
I got a sweet salvation, and it's beautiful

I got an old church choir
singing in my soul
I got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful
I've got a heart overflowing
cause I've been restored
There ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
Oh there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
