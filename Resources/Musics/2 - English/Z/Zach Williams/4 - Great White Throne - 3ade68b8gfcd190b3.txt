GREAT WHITE THRONE

I went down to the river
I fell down on my knees
Heaven take me if you please
I felt the 7th trumpet sound
I heard the angels sing
Hallelujah Christ our lord forever reigns


I felt heaven start to weep
I felt the ground beneath my feet begin to shake
As the fire began to grow
I saw heavens hand of judgment
Sitting on the great white thrown

As he opened up the book of life
The dead consumed the sea
And man was judged for every sin accordingly
Oh father please forgive me if you do not see my name
He said I'm sorry son it doesn't work that way

I felt heaven start to weep
I felt the ground beneath my feet begin to shake
As the fire began to grow
I saw heavens hand of judgment
Sitting on the great white thrown

Lord I know I'm just a sinner
And I don't deserve to go
But could you find it in your heart
To have some mercy on my soul
Cause I don't want to be cast in the burning lake of fire

When I stand before your judgment hand
On heavens great white thrown

He said I see you heard the stories
But you still refused to see
The blood that Christ shed on the cross at Calvary
Then he opened up the book once more and a tear fell from his eye
He said I've shown you grace and mercy but you must now see my fire

I felt heaven start to weep
I felt the ground beneath my feet begin to shake
As the fire began to grow
I saw heavens hand of judgment
Sitting on the great white thrown
