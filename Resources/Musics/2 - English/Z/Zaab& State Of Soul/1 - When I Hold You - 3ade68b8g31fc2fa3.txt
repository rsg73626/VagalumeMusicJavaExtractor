WHEN I HOLD YOU

When I hold you 
Make me feel alright 
When I kiss your lips baby 
Make me feel alright 

Sad and lonely for a long time 
Just dreaming of someone like you yeah 
The magic of your touch girl 
Won't get enough of you yeah 

I was lost just sitting in the back row, sad row 
Didn't know love was just a stone thrown 
A stone thrown away from me but I just couldn't see

When I hold you 
Make me feel alright 
When I kiss your lips baby 
Make me feel alright
