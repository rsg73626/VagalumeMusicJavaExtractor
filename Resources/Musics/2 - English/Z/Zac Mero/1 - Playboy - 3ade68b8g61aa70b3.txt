PLAYBOY

Monday, Thursday, doesn't matter
Go to malls on the week is always better
If I meet some chicks and the money runs out
Don't hesitate gotta call my mom right now

If I want to party on Monday and there is no club
Can't wait, I call my friends let's try some drugs
If you think I live in vain oh you are so wrong
Can't see my view, oh boy, I see that you are not strong

Think about your life, it's worst than mine
Don't try to say a word, you never get it right
Just hold on divine, oh you are so lame
Tomorrow I gonna change, you are always the same

You are always the same, your routine is a shame
Your happiness is fake, you are the only to blame
Try to awake, accept your fate
If I make a mistake, I will always be safe

Think about your life
Think about your life
It's worst than mine
It's worst than mine
It's (worst than mine x8)

uhh
ahh oh how my life is great x2

You just cant make it worth it
You don't have what it takes to do it
You just cant make it worth it
You don't have what it takes to do it
You don't have what it takes to do it
You don't have what it takes to do it
