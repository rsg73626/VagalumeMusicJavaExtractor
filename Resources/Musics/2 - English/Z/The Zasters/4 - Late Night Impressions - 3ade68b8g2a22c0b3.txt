LATE NIGHT IMPRESSIONS

It's on tonight, won't you let me in?
The night is young, my name is on the list
Turn it up (We're coming in)
There's no need to rush

Pour me a drink or make it two
Or did you think that I'd come here just for you? (Out of my way)
Let me make it through

Raise your glass, enjoy the mess
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it, do it cause

It's all right, just let it go and dance all night
No one'll remember what you'll do
Maybe not even you
It's all right, just let it go and dance all night
No one'll remember what you'll do
Maybe not even you
When it's after two

We are face to face, it's all repeating
You're going home, but we won't leave, let's keep up the show (Just keep the beat)
And some rock n' roll, yeah

Raise your glass, enjoy the mess
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it, do it cause

It's all right, just let it go and dance all night
No one'll remember what you'll do
Maybe not even you
It's all right, just let it go and dance all night
No one'll remember what you'll do
Maybe not even you
When it's after two

(Uh, ah, uh) When it's dark
(Uh, ah, uh) and the lights are gone
(Uh, ah, uh) there are no regrets

(Uh, ah, uh) When it's dark
(Uh, ah, uh) and the lights are gone
(Uh, ah, uh) there are no regrets

It's all right, (when it's dark) just let it go and dance all night (lights are gone)
No one'll remember what you'll do (no regrets)
Maybe not even you
It's all right, (when it's dark) just let it go and dance all night (lights are gone)
No one'll remember what you'll do (no regrets)
Maybe not even... you
