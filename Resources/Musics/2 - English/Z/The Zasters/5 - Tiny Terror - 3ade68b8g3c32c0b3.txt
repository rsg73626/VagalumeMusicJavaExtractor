TINY TERROR

This is it and now he's not aware of you somehow
You are so tired and no one sleeps
The streets are empty and so your dreams

"No, you can't escape, what do you have in mind tonight? "
you say
Nothing that I haven't done before
It's just a joke and nothing more

Close but not enough, did you really think that would work?
This is not a movie, you see
Collect your hopes and don't show me

Get your shoes and go
you're already late to your own show
He won't be there, no need to swear
It's not as if you would care

Lost and found, your heart is not around
Lost and found, your heart is not around
Lost and found, your heart is not around

If you think it was over, I'm sorry to tell you this
Not everything that shines is a light, nor it helps you see

If you think it was over, I'm sorry to tell you this
Nothing lasts forever, but this certainly will
