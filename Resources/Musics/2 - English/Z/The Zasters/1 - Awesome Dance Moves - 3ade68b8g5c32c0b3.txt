AWESOME DANCE MOVES

You've got these awesome dance moves
But you certainly can't pick up the clues
You've been like this your whole life
Open your arms but not yours eyes

Back in those days your mom would tell
Don't watch those tv shows from hell
The colors, lights, they were so clear
Dancing like that will get you beer

Oh oh oh you belong to a body that you can't control
Won't you try to find me when my timing get so slow
Call me if you want, while you still have one more chance
But I think it's so much better if you dance, dance, dance

If you look on the other side
You'll see there's nothing you can hide
You should come closer and let me see
These awesome moves that set you free

You've got these awesome dance moves
But you certainly can't pick up the clues
You've been like this your whole life
Open your arms but not yours eyes

Oh oh oh you belong to a body that you can't control
Won't you try to find me when my timing get so slow
Call me if you want, while you still have one more chance
But I think it's so much better if you dance, dance, dance

Just keep on moving, just like I do
Waiting for something, make you feel cool
Why don't you move? go through the roof

Oh oh oh you belong to a body that you can't control
Won't you try to find me when my timing get so slow
Call me if you want, while you still have one more chance
But I think it's so much better if you dance, dance, dance

You belong to a body that you can't control
Won't you try to find me when my timing get so slow
Call me if you want, while you still have one more chance
But I think it's so much better if you dance, dance, dance
