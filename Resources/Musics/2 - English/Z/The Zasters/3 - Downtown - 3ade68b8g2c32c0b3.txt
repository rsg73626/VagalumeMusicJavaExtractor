DOWNTOWN

Downtown
Lights go on and out, lights go on and out
I could let go, but now it's on my mind
I could let go, but now it's on my mind

Downtown
Lights go on and out, lights go on and out
I could let go, but now it's on my mind
I could let go, but now it's on my mind

Rain is pouring and I want to go home
Said I'll be okay, now I'm all alone
Water on my face, should I keep the chase?
All I pushed away have come back to stay

Downtown
Lights go on and out, lights go on and out
I could let go, but now it's on my mind
I could let go, but now it's on my mind

Rain is pouring and I want to go home
Said I'll be okay, now I'm all alone
Water on my face, should I keep the chase?
All I pushed away have come back to stay

Day and night, I wonder if this is right
Day and night, I wonder if this is right
Day and night, I wonder if this is right
Day and night, I wonder if this is right

Rain is pouring and I want to go home
Said I'll be okay, now I'm all alone
Water on my face, should I keep the chase?
All I pushed away have come back to stay
