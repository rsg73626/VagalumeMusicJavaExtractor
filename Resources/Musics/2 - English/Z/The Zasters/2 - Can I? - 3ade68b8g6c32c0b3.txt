CAN I?

The room is quiet and my mind is getting busy
You should be here by my side
I wonder how you make all problems be so easy
Forgetting all we left behind

This might get slow
If you don't see
How vicious this path can be
So now the clock will turn back time
Just like it did when we lost our minds

Can I touch your body?
Can I feel it burn?
Can I be obsessive?
Can I lose control?

Nobody told me how this place could be so empty
And now you keep asking me why
Out in the street it's all so crowded and oppressive
At least we don't have to stand by

This might get slow
If you don't see
How cold it feels, it feels so weak
I'll take that clock and cast a spell
To make you think you wish me well

Can I touch your body?
Can I feel it burn?
Can I be so obsessive?
Can I lose control?

Can I touch your body?
Can I feel it burn?
Can I be so obsessive?
Can I lose control?

Can I touch your body?
Can I feel it burn?
Can I be obsessive? Can I be obsessive?
Can I take control?

Can I touch your body? (Can I feel it burn?)
Can I feel it burn? (Can I touch your body?)
Can I be obsessive? (Can I feel it burn?)
Can I be obsessive?
Can I take control?

Can I touch your body?
Can I feel it burn?
Can I be obsessive?
Can I lose control?

Can I touch your body?
Can I feel it burn?
Can I be obsessive?
Can I lose control?
