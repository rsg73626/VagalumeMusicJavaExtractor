NOTHING CAN SEPARATE US

We've been here together for all of our lives
We've knocked down, we've made up, we've laughed til we cry
Through thick and through thin, and the good and the bad
But we'd never give up the time that we've had
Cause we are a family and that's all we've got
Yeah, we've made it this far and no matter what

Nothing can separate us
Woah woah
Though life may try to break us
Woah woah
Whatever comes between us
Nothing can separate us now
We're there for each other whatever may come
To fight for to die for till we make it home
Though we all get older and go our own way
We'll keep moving forward but nothing will change
Cause we are a family and that's all we've got
Yeah, we've made it this far and no matter what

Cause this kind of bond can't be broken
Not by distance or death
This kind of love lasts forever and ever
And never ends
