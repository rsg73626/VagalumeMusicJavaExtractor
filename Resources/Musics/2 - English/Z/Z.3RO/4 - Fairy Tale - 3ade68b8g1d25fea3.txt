FAIRY TALE

Fairy lady,who stands on the walls
Life is short and wait is long
the stars,away,dim with the dawn...
Fairy lady,who stands on the walls

Your tale has only begun 
it comes from far,the nowhereland
the wind is bliwing a sound so well known...
fairy lady,your is long gone

oh darling,hear my soul and heed my cry
cause all my crying may flood a river in my heart

"oh,life is good,
oh,life is good,oh,life is good...
as good as you wish!"

pretty lady,the horses are back
bringing joy and happiness
but all of a sudden the horses are gone
it was only the sound of your heartbeat alone

oh darling, hear my soul and heed my cry
cause all my crying may flood an ocean in my heat

"Oh, life is good,
oh, life is good,
oh,life is good...
as good as a kiss!"

Oh my darling,now i cannot halt my cries
my tears have drowned me
and i refuse to realise

whats left around me,its all so strange,its all so dark
i'm all alone here
to mend the pieces of my heart

little lady,your tale has an end
for your love to the skies was sent
he's turned into sparks that shine with the stars...

...and by night he will always be there
for his lady to stare
and thus he's never died.
