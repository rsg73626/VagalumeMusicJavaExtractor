A SIMPLE MAN

How life
Goes so interesting
But I
I've got
A feeling that you'll never know
How hard i've tried
Escape from the spell of love
You spell on me, you spell on me
Today
keep walking on the way that life
Leads me
Today
I'm just another simple man
On his work day
But when i'm coming home
On the road
I think of you, i think of you
My whole life
I have tried to belie by the own
Force of my own
Until the day when the lord
Has come
And did a real change
Inside of my own life
Only vanit and ilusion I
Used to bring down deep inside
Until the day when the lord
Has come
And did real change of my whole life

REFR√ÉO
Jesus
I have found you/I will love you
I confess that you are the king
Owner of my life
