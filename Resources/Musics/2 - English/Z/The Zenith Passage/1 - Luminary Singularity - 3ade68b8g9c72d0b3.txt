LUMINARY SINGULARITY

Experimenting with neuro-physical disillusions
Deciphering the luminary inquiries
Waves and disconnected particles parallel
With one another universally projected
Perceptual collective
The luminary singularity
Radiance emitting from this chasm of flesh
Separating itself or embodied concurrently
Beams protruding various velocities
Scattering across the galaxies
Creating sustainable forms of life
Imminent being pulsing through cellular
Life replicating itself in entirety
Pulsing, creating
Questioning the principle of life
Forms birthed from the light
Luminescence is mankind's vaguest illusion
Radiance emitting from this chasm of flesh
Separating itself or embodied concurrently
Beams protruding various velocities
Scattering across the galaxies
Creating sustainable forms of life
