AWAKENING

I been reaching out
To someone in that big light house
I could feel me sinking down

Swimming against the tide that I divide
I thought I'd lost it all
Thought I'd made my final call
So may go from young to old
But I couldn't see the final scene within with you

I couldn't see the beautiful, couldn't hear the truth
Couldn't feel me, locked up
'til you came and let me loose
And nothing tasted sweeter than
this life's so feeling free
To finally smell the scent of who
who I'm supposed to be

It's been a very very long time
But I feel it now, my awakening
It's been a mighty mighty long time
But I'm here without, pain and suffering

I'm feeling your love
It's coming back to me
It's coming back to me
It's coming back to me
With the bitterness scoffed
And the devil back to sleep
I'm coming back to me
I'm coming back to me

It's been a very very long time

I'm here again
Yesterday was not my friend
But now I'm not so innocent
Standing against the wall, a little taller
My interior
It don't feeling furia
Sometimes we get delirious
But I know my soul is on its road when I'm with you

I couldn't see the beautiful, couldn't hear the truth
Couldn't feel me, locked up 'til you came and let me loose
And nothing tasted sweeter than, this life's so feeling free
To finally smell the scent of who, who I'm supposed to be

It's been a very very long time
But I feel it now, my awakening

I'm feeling your love
It's coming back to me
It's coming back to me
It's coming back to me
With the bitterness scoffed
And the devil back to sleep
I'm coming back to me
I'm coming back to me

It's been a very very long time
It's been a mighty mighty long time

It's been a very very long time
But I feel it now, my awakening
