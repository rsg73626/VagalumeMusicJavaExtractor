EVERYBODY NEEDS LOVE

[Verse 1]
Got no time to pay attention
Ain't no smiling in a morning rush
I put the face on hoping on
No one in the mirror's keeping watch

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And it feels like I've been down, yeah, for so long
I've been waiting for a wake up call to take me home

[Chorus]
I need that love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love, love

Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
We don't fight for the fallen
We don't give to be given up
There's no patience in our eyes
In these god forsaken times
Where enough is enough
Yeah, enough is enough

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause it feels like we've been down, yeah, for so long
We've been waiting for a wake up call to take us home

[Chorus]
I need that love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love, love

Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
I keep holding on, holding on
I keep holding on, holding on
I keep holding on, holding on
For love, for love, for love, for love

I keep holding on, holding on
I keep holding on, holding on
I keep holding on, holding on
For love, for love, for love, for love, for love

Oh I keep holding on, yeah I keep holding on
For love, for love, for love, for love

[Chorus]
I need that love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love, love
(Everyone needs love, yeah)

Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love, love
(Everyone needs love)
