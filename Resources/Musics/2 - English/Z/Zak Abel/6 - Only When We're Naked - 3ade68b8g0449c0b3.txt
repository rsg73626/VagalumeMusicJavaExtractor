ONLY WHEN WE'RE NAKED

Baby, let me know you
Nothing but the whole truth
I wanna see the side of you
You don't reveal
Love me at your loudest
Let me see your wildest
This feeling in my heart is cold
And I'm for real

So intoxicating, when we make love
Only when we're naked, can we be one

Only when we're naked
Like we were created
Only when we're naked
Can we be one tonight, just you and I

I don't wanna hold back
Baby, you should know that
I would walk across the world
To see you through
We can make it holy
You just gotta show me
'Cause I say love's a ruined word
Meant for two

So intoxicating, when we make love
Only when we're naked, can we be one

Only when we're naked
Like we were created
Only when we're naked
Can we be one tonight, just you and I

Wanna be naked, I wanna be naked with you (woohoo)
Wanna be naked, I wanna be naked with you (woohoo)
I'm feeling your lovin', your energy pulling me through (woohoo)
Wanna be naked, I wanna be naked with yoou, ooh, oh yeah
Wanna be naked with you baby, wanna be naked with you baby
OOh

Only when we're naked
Like we were created
I don't wanna fake it
Can we be one tonight, just you and I
