THESE ARE THE DAYS

No keys on the table
Mama says it's bad luck
Walking through the doorway
I'm already looking up
One hand on the future
One hand on today
Although I know leaving ain't easy
I'm on my way

All the days gone by with no fire in my eyes
I'm ready for a flame to come
Need to chase these lights
While my youth is on my side
So I pick up my feet and away I run

Step back onto the road
And the troublemaker's back in the fold
I hear familiar voices calling me on
They say "son, you've been away for too long"
Cause these are the days, these are the days
These are the days
Cause these are the days, these are the days
These are the days

Fresh air in the morning
Blood rushing at night
As long as I keep moving
Then everything'll be alright
The devil's in my system
And I've got to get it out
I've been waiting forever
For heaven to come on down

These are the days, these are the days
These are the days
These are the days, these are the days
These are the days
