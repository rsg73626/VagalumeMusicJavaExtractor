DESERVE TO BE LOVED

I spent most of my time complaining
Don't I feel I have enough?
For what exactly am I waiting?
Don't I deserve to be loved?

People say I should be harder
Cause they're no good at being soft
But I've grown up without a father, hmm
Don't I deserve to be loved?

By someone who is brave enough to give
Someone I can share my journey with
Someone who knows me
Someone who knows me, yeah

Someone who wants us both to grow
Someone who'd be strong enough alone
Someone who knows me
Not someone who owns me

You look at me though I'm a sinner
That kind who blends in with the dust
How did that come to be a winner?
Oh, didn't think I deserve to be loved

By someone who is brave enough to give
Someone I can share my journey with
Someone who knows me
Someone who knows me, yeah

Someone who wants us both to grow
Someone who'd be strong enough alone
Someone who knows me
Not someone who owns me

Baby we deserve it
I'll make it sure you heard it
Baby we deserve to be loved

Ohooh, baby we deserve it
I'll make it sure you heard it
Baby we deserve to be loved

By someone who is brave enough to give
Someone I can share my journey with
Someone who knows me
Someone who knows me, yeah

Someone who wants us both to grow
Someone who'd be strong enough alone
Someone who knows me
Not someone who owns me
