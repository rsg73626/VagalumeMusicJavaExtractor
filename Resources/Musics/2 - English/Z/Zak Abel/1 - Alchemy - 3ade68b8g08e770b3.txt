ALCHEMY

I feel this alchemy
Ready to go
You are the centrepiece
Heaven to hold, well, well, well

Something keeps telling me you are no good
(I don't listen baby)
How could you make me feel so blue?

We don't need to question what it is
I can taste your poison on my lips
I'm being changed and I won't say no
Baby, I'm crazy for wanting more
Every time I come back around, it's alchemy reborn

Blood on my fingertips
Cut by a rose
You are the symphony
I couldn't compose

Something keeps telling me you are no good
(I don't listen baby)
How could you make me feel so blue?

We don't need to question what it is
I can taste your poison on my lips
I'm being changed and I won't say no, Ba
by, I'm crazy for wanting more
Every time I come back around, it's alchemy reborn

We don't need to question what it is
I can taste your poison on my lips
I'm being changed and I won't say no
Baby, I'm crazy for wanting more
Every time I come back around, it's alchemy reborn
