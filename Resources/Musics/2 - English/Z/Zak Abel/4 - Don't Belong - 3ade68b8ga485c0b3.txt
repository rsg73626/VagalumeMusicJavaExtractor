DON'T BELONG

I've been doing what I feel
And I'm feeling what I do
Never gonna fall in line
I'm a rebel up my roots
You can't control, oh, you can't control
You can't control me baby

Ever sign up on my back
And the lipstick on my sheets
Everything is everything
And the world is at my feet
I want it all, I want it all

I don't belong
And I know that's fine
I might be wrong
But I feel alright
We don't belong
But we don't belong together

I don't need to justify
When I'm walking in my shoes
I could go the extra mile
If it means that much to you
I'm good to go, I'm good to go

So don't go telling me your stories
Cause I heard 'em before
I ain't believing but you're preaching
So don't knock on my door
I don't wanna know, don't wanna know

I don't belong
And I know that's fine
I might be wrong
But I feel alright
We don't belong
But we don't belong together

And nobody knows which road to take
They're only playing guessing games
All we can do is light the way

I don't belong
And I know that's fine
I might be wrong
But I feel alright
We don't belong
But we don't belong together

I don't belong
I don't belong
And it's never gonna change, oh
It's the way it is
