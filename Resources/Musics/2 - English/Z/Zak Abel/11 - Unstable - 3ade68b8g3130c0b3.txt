UNSTABLE

You're up, I'm just getting in
So rough, God knows where I've been
Your eyes are staring at my sins
There's no time to speak our minds

All of our frustrations on hold
'Cause you don't know the life that I know
Standing straight but I'm off the wall
You need love but I'm in my zone

I know, I know, I know, I know you deserve better
Someone that give you all the things that I could never
I'd love to be the one that stays with you forever
I don't wanna let you go
I just think that you should know
I'm unstable
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm unstable

I'm up and you're just getting in
So tough, two wrongs never win
Your hands are pressed against my skin
There's no time to speak our minds

All of our frustrations on hold
'Cause you don't know the life that I know
Standing straight but I'm off the wall
You need love but I'm in my zone

I know, I know, I know, I know you deserve better
Someone that give you all the things that I could never
I'd love to be the one that stays with you forever
I don't wanna let you go
I just think that you should know
I'm unstable
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm unstable
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Even when we're both got nothing on
Life's so fine, still wait to come between us
Never tell me that you're close to done
I hate to be your one and only witness

'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you deserve better
Someone that give you all the things that I could never
I'd love to be the one that stays with you forever
I don't wanna let you go
I just think that you should know
I know, I know, I know, I know you deserve better
Someone that give you all the things that I could never
I'd love to be the one that stays with you forever
I don't wanna let you go
I just think that you should know
I'm unstable
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm unstable
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm unstable
