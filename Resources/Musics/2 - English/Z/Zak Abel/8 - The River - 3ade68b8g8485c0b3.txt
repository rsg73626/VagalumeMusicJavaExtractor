THE RIVER

On a cab drive home from the dark side
Hearing fat lip preach from the far side
I was told about her, I was told about her
As we stopped in front of the red light
The rain washed our [?] dead night
I was told about her, I was told about her

She is pure, our eyes connect through the rear view
But you want more than she's giving you
As you're telling me your lies
And you're telling me your truths, well

She don't have no choice
She don't have no choice in the matter
Oh just sailing down the river
She don't have no voice
She only has a silence to shatter
She's just sailing down the river to the grave

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Sailing down the river

As they picked her up, Mississippi mud
On your hands and yeah, you were covered up
I was told about you, I've been worried about you
On a missing high, she changed her light
But it's not your your word to justify
I was told about you, I was warned about you

She is pure, our eyes connect through the rear view
But you want more than she's giving you
As you're telling me your lies
And you're telling me your truths, well

She don't have no choice
She don't have no choice in the matter
Oh just sailing down the river
She don't have no voice
She only has a silence to shatter
She's just sailing down the river to the grave

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Sailing down the river to the grave
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Sailing down the river

She don't have no choice
She don't have no choice in the matter
Oh just sailing down the river
She don't have no voice
She only has a silence to shatter
She's just sailing down the river to the grave, ooh
Ooh, yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
