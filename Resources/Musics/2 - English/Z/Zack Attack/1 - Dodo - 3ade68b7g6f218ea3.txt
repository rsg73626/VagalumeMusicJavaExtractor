DODO

I met him in a cloud down in La-la land 
Where it’s floppy and stretchy just like a rubber band 
B-A-N-D band 
He walked up to me and he twisted back my arm 
I asked him his name and in a gurgly voice he said 
Dodo 
D-O-D-O dodo 
Do-do-do-do dodo 

Well I ain’t the world's most flexible guy 
But when he jack-hammered my back he didn’t broke my spine 
Oh my, Dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Well I'm not dumb but I can't really see 
Why he wears all this GAP and doesn’t let me call him G 
Oh my, Dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 

Well, we drank lemonade and stayed up and boxed 
And played tag with a cinderblock 
He picked up a hammer and banged my knee 
But I was used to it and I didn’t scream 
Well, he’s not the world's most sweet guy, 
but when I looked in his eyes, well I almost fell for my 
Dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 

I kicked him away 
I charged like a boar 
I tripped to the floor 
I got off of my knees 
Then I whacked his face and he did the same to me 

Well that's the way that it stayed 
And I always want to kick the noggin of my Dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 
Boys will whack boys and boys will whack girls 
It's a crazy, zany, stupid world especially Dodo 
Do-do-do-do-dodo 

Well we tunneled underground just a week before 
And I'd never ever met a groundhog before 
But Dodo laughed and bent back my hand 
And said “Zack Attack you’re a funny man!” 

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man 
But I know what I am and I’m glad I’m a man 
And so is Lola 
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola 
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
