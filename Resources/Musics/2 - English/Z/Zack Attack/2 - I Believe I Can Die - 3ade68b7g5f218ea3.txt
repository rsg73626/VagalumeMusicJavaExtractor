I BELIEVE I CAN DIE

I like to think that I cannot go on 
And life is ringing my ears like a gong 
But now I know the meaning of true thugs 
I'm gasping in those buff muscular arms 
If I can see it, then I can do it 
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it 

I believe I can die 
I believe my soul can go to the sky 
I think about it every night and day 
Get shot down and die today 
I believe my soul can soar 
I see me running from a charging boar 
I believe I can die 
I believe I can die 
(Oh) I believe I can die 

See I’m on the verge of breaking down 
Sometimes death can seem so loud 
There are miracles in life I can’t achieve 
Because they come from inside of me 

I believe I can fall 
Up the golden stairs I will crawl 
I think about it every sun and moon 
Get splashed by a great tycoon 
I believe that I need help 
I am nothing but a rotting whelp 
I believe I can die 
I believe I can die 
(Oh) I believe I can die 

Cause I believe in it! 

I believe I can die 
I believe my soul can go to the sky 
I think about it every night and day 
Get shot down and die today 
I believe my soul can soar 
I see me running from a charging boar 
I believe I can die 
I believe I can die 
(Oh) I believe I can die 

I believe I can fall 
Up the golden stairs I will crawl 
I think about it every sun and moon 
Get splashed by a great tycoon 
I believe that I need help 
I am nothing but a rotting whelp 
I believe I can die 
I believe I can die 
(Oh) I believe I can die 

Ouch
