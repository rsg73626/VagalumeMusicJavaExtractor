CROSSFIRE

You said that our love was the best thing you'd ever had
But you wouldn't commit to us for reasons now I understand
Walk outs
Phone calls
Things that never made any sense at all
But shame on me for being naive

Now I'm searching for a way out
But theres something that keeps me falling back down
And I find myself oh

I'm wounded
Beat Up
Tryna fight for you in this battle zone
Neglected
All fired up
Should of walked away I'm better off alone
Cause now I'm caught up in a crossfire
Fire, fire, fire

Now he don't get no sympathy
He should have known with you
What he got himself into
And now I'm treated like the enemy?
When I wasn't at fault and all I did
Was give you my all and this is what I get
So do you even blame me for the things I said?
Shame on you for being so naive

But now I'm searching for a way out
But theres something that keeps me falling back down
And I find myself oh

I'm wounded
Beat Up
Tryna fight for you in this battle zone
Neglected
All fired up
Should of walked away I'm better off alone
Cause now I'm caught up in a crossfire
Fire, fire, fire
