AWAKE

Its always a pleasure to see you
Always a memorable coincidence
And now that you stand there in full view
I see now it all makes perfect sense

Cause now we're together you and me
Lets make a toast create history
And as you lay here next to me
I sit and watch you fall asleep but

I dont wanna close my eyes
I just wanna stay awake forever
Cause when I'm with you time flies
If only we could spend every second together
With you I'll stay awake x3

I feel your affection around
I love how you play on your beautiful innocence
And now your part of the scene where the sun sets
I couldn't want for anything more

Cause now we're together you and me
Lets make a toast create history
And as you lay here next to me
I sit and watch you fall asleep but

I dont wanna close my eyes
I just wanna stay awake forever
Cause when I'm with you time flies
If only we could spend every second together
With you I'll stay awake x3

And even when my eyes begin to close
My heart remains wide open
So hold me now and dont let go, dont let go

I dont wanna close my eyes
I just wanna stay awake forever
Cause when I'm with you time flies
And I just wanna spend the seconds with you
Ohh x8
