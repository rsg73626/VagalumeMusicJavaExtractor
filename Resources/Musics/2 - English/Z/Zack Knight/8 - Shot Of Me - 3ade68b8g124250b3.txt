SHOT OF ME

Step to the mark girl wait in line
I'm like your favourite flavour that you always crave on
B-bite your lips girl ride it out
Cause where it takes you to a place girl we don't talk about

One drop on the rocks I'ma serve you up up
One shot bartender we can pour it up
You can put it on my tab whenever you want that rush
So go ahead and fill that cup cup
But beware cause I'll get you hooked

Take a sip drink me up
Let it burn in your burn in your mouth
Take a shot of me (me) x2
Take a shot of me now
Take a shot of me (me) x2
Take a shot of me now

Uh girl you wanna shot of me
Uh like you won the lottery
Uh girl this is all I do
Me & Zee Kay plus my crew hit the bar till half past 2
3 girls on round 2 take 2 girls to round 3
Its a round 3 and I like girls
That like girls that like me
She on now her friends too
Shoot out like a western
Take shots till her chest burn
Then take her down like a wrestler

One drop on the rocks I'ma serve you up up
One shot bartender we can pour it up
You can put it on my tab whenever you want that rush
So go ahead and fill that cup cup
But beware cause I'll get you hooked

Take a sip drink me up
Let it burn in your burn in your mouth
Take a shot of me (me) x2
Take a shot of me now
Take a shot of me (me) x2
Take a shot of me now

Now I got you drunk drunk drunk drunk on my love x2
Take a shot of me now
Take a shot of me now
