BETTER THAN ME

It ain't healthy what they tell me
That we're not alike me and you
Ordinary, that I can't be
I admit that I don't follow no rules

So they shoot me down single me out
Cause they don't wanna understand me
Stare at me up and down like I'm a freak
Cause they don't wanna see

See me break out from the regular
Don't follow no crowd switch the formula
And I'll do it my way till the lights go out out out
When they to put me in a box I'ma break it
When they try to tell me what I'm not I wont fake it
Don't care what they say, I'll do it my way
Cause nobody can do this better, better, better than me

Watch me break free from the boundaries
That you were programmed to believe
I wont stand back and just follow whatever's in front of me

So they shoot me down single me out
Cause they don't wanna understand me
Stare at me up and down like I'm a freak
Cause they don't wanna see

See me break out from the regular
Don't follow no crowd switch the formula
And I'll do it my way till the lights go out out out
When they to put me in a box I'ma break it
When they try to tell me what I'm not I wont fake it
Don't care what they say, I'll do it my way
Cause nobody can do this better, better, better than me

Cause nobody no no nobody no x2
Bet-better than me
Cause nobody no no nobody no x2
Bet-better than me

So they shoot me down single me out
Cause they don't wanna understand me
Stare at me up and down like I'm a freak
Cause they don't wanna see

See me break out from the regular
Don't follow no crowd switch the formula
And I'll do it my way till the lights go out out out
When they to put me in a box I'ma break it
When they try to tell me what I'm not I wont fake it
Don't care what they say, I'll do it my way
Cause nobody can do this better, better, better than me
