HURT

Slow down before you fall too deep
Don't you wear your heart on your sleeve
'cause I'm quite quite the opposite of perfect
So girl don't let me be the reason for your downfall
'cause it's gonna be a long long way down, yeah

Chorus
So if I were you I would turn around
Dont even bother
Leave right now
Before I love you and leave ya
Do as I say, turn the other way
Don't come any closer
Girl I warn ya
Your only gonna get hurt hurt hurt x2


One day you'll thank me
Save yourself tonight
Run away, the truth never feels right
Don't cry Im not even worth it
Don't let me be the reason for your downfall
'cause it's gonna be a long long way down down down


Chorus
So if I were you I would turn around
Dont even bother
Leave right now
Before I love you and leave ya
Do as I say, turn the other way
Don't come any closer
Girl I warn ya
Your only gonna get hurt hurt hurt x2

And I know how this all my sound
But it's not you, it's me that needs help
So I won't take it personally
If I'm not what you're looking for, for, for?

Chorus
So if I were you I would turn around
Dont even bother
Leave right now
Before I love you and leave ya
Do as I say, turn the other way
Don't come any closer
Girl I warn ya
Your only gonna get hurt hurt hurt x2
