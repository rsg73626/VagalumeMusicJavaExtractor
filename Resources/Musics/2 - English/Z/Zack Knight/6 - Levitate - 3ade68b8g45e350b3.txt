LEVITATE

I'll take you to another place
A place you've never been before
Somewhere out of space
Where time don't matter anymore!
It's gonna be great
Into a dimension, make me be?
Girl, let me take you there
Cause we don't have no gravity up here!

Pre-chorus
Let me levitate you
Lift off the ground!
Let me educate you
With my love somehow!

Chorus
Oh baby, we're waiting for the count down
One day imagine we can touch the sky!
Take up, and make your trouble drown now
Hold me, so we can give this love a try!
Lay, just let me
Oh, oh, oh
Just let me levitate you!
Oh, oh, oh!
Just let me levitate you!

Don't be afraid of letting go
Cause I will catch you if you fall!
Don't hesitate, cause we both know
It's nothing shy or supernatural!
Cause baby girl, let me raise you
Six feet up the ground and?
Girl I'll hold you there
Cause we don't have the gravity up here!

Pre-chorus
Let me levitate you
Lift off the ground!
Let me educate you
With my love somehow!

Chorus
Baby, we're waiting for the count down
One day imagine we can touch the skies!
Take up, and make your trouble drown now
Hold me, so we can give this love a try!
Lay, just let me
Oh, oh, oh
Just let me levitate you!
Oh, oh, oh!
Just let me levitate you!

Just like a parachute
I will carry you
Till your feet touch the ground
And be safe and sound
Cause you don't need wings to fly
All you need is my love to lift you up
My love, my love, my love
Maybe just lay back!

Chorus
Baby, we're waiting for the count down
One day imagine we can touch the skies!
Take up, and make your trouble drown now
Hold me, so we can give this love a try!
Lay, just let me
Oh, oh, oh
Just let me levitate you!
Oh, oh, oh!
Just let me levitate you!
