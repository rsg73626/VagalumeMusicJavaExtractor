POISON IN MY SLEEP

Can we slow it down for a second
So we can talk this through
I dont wanna hear another record
I know what your tryna do
Cause everytime you love me your lying your lying
Its a game that you've always been trying trying

Its like I'm caught up in a trap
As if all these four walls are closing in on me
And I can't have it any other way
Cause this aint even me right here girl here girl
But when you come around I swear girl

You fill my mind with all these thoughts
I've not conceived
Cause in those eyes is where my conscience starts to leave
And I know that your bad for me
You're like poison in my sleep so deadly
You're like poison in my sleep

You fill my mind with all these thoughts
I've not conceived
Cause in those eyes is where my conscience starts to leave
And I know that your bad for me
You're like poison in my sleep so deadly
You're like poison in my sleep

Yeah you know how to fake it when you want girl
By talking to me in that way
I know Im gonna hate myself tomorrow
Knowing I messed up again
Cause every time you love me your lying
Its a lane that you've always been driving

Yeah you caught me on the sly
Catch 22 can't even try to walk away
You keep messing with my mind, messing with the rules
And I cant have it any other way
Cause this aint even me right here girl here girl
But when you come around I swear girl

You fill my mind with all these thoughts I've not conceived
Cause in those eyes is where my conscience starts to leave
And I know that your bad for me
Your like poison in my sleep so deadly
Your like poison in my sleep

You fill my mind with all these thoughts I cant believe
Cause in those eyes
Is where my conscience starts to leave
And I know that your bad for me
You're like poison in my sleep so deadly
You're like poison in my sleep
