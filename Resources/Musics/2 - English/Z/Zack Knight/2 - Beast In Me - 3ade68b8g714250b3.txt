BEAST IN ME

Cold Sweats
Blood Rushing
U take me to a place I don? t recognise
Breatheless for your loving
I need another dose before I lose my mind

I? ll be the one that you can? t love
Cause you bring it out, this side of me, With a body so mean I just can? t control myself

You bring out the beast in me, baby
You bring out the animal whenever we? re alone
You bring out the beast in me, baby
You bring out the animal whenever we? re alone
Alo-oo-oone x3
The beast in me x2


Cut to the chase
I? m take you down, theres something about your scent that always drives me wild
Face to face
Here and now, I? m never out of breathe you know I go for miles
You know I got a weakness cause girl you leave me speechless
And I aint keeping any secrets, you know exactly what your doing to me

I? ll be the one that you can? t love
Cause you bring it out, this side of me, With a body so mean I just can? t control myself


You bring out the beast in me, baby
You bring out the animal whenever we? re alone
You bring out the beast in me, baby
You bring out the animal whenever we? re alone
Alo-oo-oone x3
The beast in me x2


Baby when the claws come out (claws come out)
You won? t recognise this face
Baby when the claws come out (claws come out)
I? ll take you down all the way
You aint gotta be afraid but when your talking to me in that way
You do it to me x2


You bring out the beast in me, baby
You bring out the animal whenever we? re alone
You bring out the beast in me, baby
You bring out the animal whenever we? re alone
Alo-oo-oone x3
The beast in me x4
