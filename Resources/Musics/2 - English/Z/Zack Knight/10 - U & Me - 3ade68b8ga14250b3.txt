U & ME

Do you remember
we used to run around hanging out on every corner
We were together almost all the time
But now when I reach out theres no answer

How did we stem so far, from where we were
We messed around made mistakes but we were so in love
Then everyone got involved made you turn away
I could go on and on but what I'm tryna say

Is can we go back to the way it was?
Back to the place we're we can live in peace
Can we go back to amazing?
Without all the fuss when it was just you & me
Two peas in a pod they called us
Till they got involved spreading them rumours
Can we go back to amazing?
Back to the place just you & me

Where did we go wrong? for you to turn a blind
Listen to that bull they were feeding you
Now your probably somewhere chillng in his bed
While hes talking sweet nothings in your ear

How did we stem so far, from where we were
We messed around made mistakes
But we were so in love
Then everyone got involved made you turn away
I could go on and on but what I'm tryna say

Is can we go back to the way it was?
Back to the place we're we can live in peace
Can we go back to amazing?
Without all the fuss when it was just you & me
Two peas in a pod they called us
Till they got involved spreading them rumours
Can we go back to amazing?
Back to the place just you & me

Cause you know I know
Theres nowhere to run theres nowhere to hide baby
You know I know there's no other one
I'm not in the wrong
Don't listen to the stories that they've told you
Don't think that I would ever disappoint you

Is can we go back to the way it was?
Back to the place we're we can live in peace
Can we go back to amazing?
Without all the fuss when it was just you & me
Two peas in a pod they called us
Till they got involved spreading them rumours
Can we go back to amazing?
Back to the place just you & me
