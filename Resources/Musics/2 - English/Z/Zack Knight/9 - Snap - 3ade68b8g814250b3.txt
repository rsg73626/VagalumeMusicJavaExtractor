SNAP

Baby I love it when you tell me what to do
Talk me down let it out fire in the booth
When you say what's really on your mind on your mind
Go on go on take the keys to the coupe
Show me what you really wan' do
Just lay it down on the line
Girl cause you know how much

I love it when you snap
Your fingers

Your fingers
Cause when you play the boss
I'm the employee
Got me worked up when you take control of me
I love it when you act like that

I love it when you snap

Cause when your on top

I let you call the shots
Without hesitating

So take the wheel get in the front seat
Cause I love it when your all upon me
Take control of it take control of it
Its your time its all on me
But dont wait dont wait dont wait
Dont wait for me to change my mind cause tonight
You can take advantage say and I'll arrange it

I love it when you snap
Your fingers

When you light up like a match
Theres nothing more that I love
Than to see you throw a tantrum and make me man up
Take the lead lets make up
For the things you only dreamed of
Cause you know I get a rush when I see you

Snap your fingers

Your fingers
Cause when you play the boss

Got me worked up when you take control of me
I love it when you act like that

I love it when you snap
Your fingers

Your fingers
Cause when your on top
I aint complaining
I let you call the shots
Without hesitating
