SUNSHINE

They don't want you kicking' it with me
I'm feeling you and it ain't hard to see
Wrote you up a letter
Put it in your locker
To let you know that I love you girl

Every time you see me baby I come running'
You should be my girlfriend
We got somethin' in common
One day you'll be my woman and I can be your guy
And baby we'll be all right

They don't really want to see us together
I wish there was a way I could make it better
You don't have to worry
I'll never let you down
I will never let you down baby

If you put your trust in me
Cuz I got what you need
Forever we could be
And we could take a lap up to the sky

Cuz baby your love is like sunshine
It never rains when I'm around you girl
Baby your love is like sunshine
You light up my day when you're calling me your baby

And I don't really care what they say
Cuz Ima love you anyway
I never let a day go by so when I look up in the sky

Baby your love is like sunshine
Your love is like sunshine girl

Hey you're a pretty girl, it's not fair
I know you miss me when I'm not there
And I can't wait to be by your side
Meet me at the movies with your friends tonight

When you're near me girl my heart starts jumping'
Tell the whole world
Baby I'm not frontin'

One day you'll be my woman and I can be your guy
And baby girl we'll be all right
You can put your trust in me
Cuz I got what you need
Forever we could be
And we could take a lap up to the sky

Cuz baby your love is like sunshine
It never rains when I'm around you girl
Baby your love is like sunshine
You light up my day when you're calling me your baby

And I don't really care what they say
Cuz Ima love you anyway
I never let a day go by so when I look up in the sky

Baby your love is like sunshine

If I had it my way
We would never be apart
And girl you're in my heart
And it's hurtin' me inside
And it kills me to see you cry
So baby let me dry your eyes
And when you think of me
Just look up in the sky

Put your trust in me
Cuz I got what you need
Forever we could be
And we could take a lap up to the sky

Cuz baby your love is like sunshine
It never rains when I'm around you girl
Baby your love is like sunshine
You light up my day when you're calling me your baby

And I don't really care what they say
Cuz Ima love you anyway
I never let a day go by so when I look up in the sky

Baby your love is like sunshine

Your love is like sunshine girl
