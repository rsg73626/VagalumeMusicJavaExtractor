SUMMER

When I met you in the summer
Took my heart beat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon

When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer (summer)
Took my heart beat sound (hey)
We fell in love (summer)
As the leaves turned brown (hey)
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue (hey)
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

Summer

When I met you in the summer!
Summer! Ey!
Summer! Ey!
Summer! Ey!
Summer! Ey!
