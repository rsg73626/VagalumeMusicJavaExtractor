BURN

We, we don't have to worry about nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race
Human race

When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave
No, we just wanna be right now
And what we see
Is everybody's on the floor acting crazy
Getting loco to the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we stop the vibe
And we bump it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no sleeping now, no sleeping now (no sleeping)

When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn
