I WANT

After all the time we had together, 
You ask me why I gave up.
The answer is you.
The truth is us.

Why keeping this when we were both suffering?
Why crying because it's over?
Let's smile because it happened, 
let's still be friends.

I want to say I’m sorry
But how could I?
You hide away from me.
I want to tell you the truth.
Bout how could I?
You want me out of your life.

You want to try again, 
I want to give it a rest.
You want me now, forever
I think we should wait.

We love each other, 
But we have another problems, 
You want me for yourself.
I need you to call me more.

I want to say I’m sorry
But how could I?
You hide away from me.
I want to tell you the truth.
Bout how could I?
You want me out of your life.
