CRAZY FOR YOU

(feat. Sean Don)

Today I'm having a good day
Just thinkin bout my baby
He turns me on
He gives me love I won't deny
Come over here
Let me give, I wanna give you all my love

[1]
I'm giving you my love
All my love to you
What else can I do
I'm crazy for you
I'm giving you my love
All my love to you
What else can I do
I'm crazy for you

Look what you've done
My body craves for you
When you kiss my lips, make me trip
I don't know what to do
You are my heart baby
I can't let go
You got me high
Can't you see in my eyes that I can't

Can't get enough of you
I love the things you do
You can have all this love
Can't wait to feel your touch

[Repeat 1]

[Sean Don]
I met a girl named Tamika
On a jet to Costa Rica
Usta wanna freak her
Till I thought real deeper
She took me out the game
Put me in the right lane
Walk me out the rain
From all the feelings and the pain
My hobby was to play straight Max or Flippie ay (?)
Lay a brick a day till real love came my way
Now I care less
Put the stress off my chest
Living to my best
You turned my life outta mess
You got my love (just let me give)
You got my love (giving my love)
You got my love (there's no one else I'm thinking of)

[Eboni]
Just let me give
Give you my love
There's no one else I'm thinking of

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 1]

Just let me give
Give you my love
There's no one else I'm thinking of
Just let me give
Give you my love
There's no one else I'm thinking of
