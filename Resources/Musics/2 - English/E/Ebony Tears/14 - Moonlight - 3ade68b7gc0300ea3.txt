MOONLIGHT

Dim the light of human sight cause I fail to see the meaning
My own thoughts are choking me when I try to breathe
I can't control the wicked things planted inside my head
Trapped inside the black tunnel that used to be my soul

I cannot hide from the sweltering fear etched inside my body
I can't control the subliminal thoughts that grow inside my mind
Day by day I'm drifting further and further away
From the man I used to be not much left of the real me

The pain grows stronger everyday and my soul is turning black
Left alone with useless thoughts and a life beginning to crack
If you could see inside of me and taste my bitter life
You would see an empty soul drowned in misery

In the moonlight dancing madly backwards
In the cold light no pain will touch my soul
In the moonlight surrounded by darkness
It feels so right I'm burning I'm burning until sunrise

I drown in the darkness I'm fading away
Nothing can stop me now
Another dimension is opening for me
My eyes are closed but I still see the light

Take me higher show me the way
I'm lost beyond pain

In the moonlight dancing madly backwards
In the cold light no pain will touch my soul
In the moonlight surrounded by darkness
It feels so right I'm burning I'm burning

In the moonlight dancing madly backwards
In the cold light no pain will touch my soul
