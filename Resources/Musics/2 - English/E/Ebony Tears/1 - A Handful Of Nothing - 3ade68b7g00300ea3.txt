A HANDFUL OF NOTHING

With closed eyes I greet the fallen
Joy denied autums calling
Withering beauty scornful madness
My redemption
A sanctuary from a year of failures
A home for the broken

Time to rest my weary bones
To ease my heart I drop the stone
In solitude I feel no pain
And for a moment I am sane

Organized from the chaos
All intact I face the rain
Wasted beauty owned by liars
True deception
Count me in as one of the cowards
I'm no exception

Time to rest my weary bones
To ease my heart I drop the stone
In solitude I feel no pain
And for a moment I am sane

With a handful of nothing
And scars in my soul
With a handful of nothing
I walk through the door

Into sanctuary
