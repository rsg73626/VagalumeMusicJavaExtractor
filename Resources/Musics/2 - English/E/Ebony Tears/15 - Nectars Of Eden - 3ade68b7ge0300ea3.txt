NECTARS OF EDEN

I feel the heat from the flames
I'm dying the essence of pain
This bitter life has come to an end
My mind is tired my heart is bleeding
I can feel the taste from the nectars of Eden
Never again shall I face the pain of living
In a world of shame

When my yellow dies under velvet thoughts
I feel no pain within
I've kissed the crystals of Eden

Out of the fire I leave this bitter pain
My only desire get away from this world of shame
Come take me higher save me from the flames
The essence of power a jester's sweet charade

I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind
I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind

Never again. No more pain
I feel the taste from the nectars of Eden

I am leaving this world of utopia
No more sadness cause I'm on my way
In a state unacquainted to nausea
In the Garden of Eden I stay

I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind
I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind

Out of the fire I leave this bitter pain
My only desire get away from this world of shame
Come take me higher save me from the flames
The essence of power a jester's sweet charade
