LUCIFIED...EVIL AS HELL

Spawned of chaos I'm blessed with no pride
666 is my mission in life
Possessed by the demon that lives in my soul
I'll slow down when I'm six feet below
I'm determined I'll never give in
When I'm through you will wallow in sin
You feed me with hatred you trigger my mind
Perversion deluxe is the truth of mankind

Now just let it burn
Drenched in fire
This world shall turn
So I let you bleed
Only your own blood
Will make you see

Intrusive I burn through your soul
I'm taking you out down you shall go
Your mind is infected you'll rot from within
Satan will laugh unfolding his grin
No way out still you deny
Truth of mankind is built on a lie
Hatred corruption denial and greed
Basic ingredients of true human breed

Mankind turn dehumanized
A quantum leap of evilsize
Chaos reigns you've lost it all
Like low life dogs you'll face the fall

Obey life ends right now
Like a ton of bricks I crush you down

Scorn you held your head high so how low will you go?
Now death is awaiting cause I run this show
Pisspour and soaked from the blood you bleed
You're ending your life like a dog on a leash
Disillusioned and fucked up you'll finally know
The purpose of life lost its charm long ago
