HANDS OF DOOM

So you choose to stay imprisoned? Cause the walls will never speak
But as the hands of doom consumes your mind they will watch you bleed
So you turned away for ever? Left your dreams locked up inside
Life has given scars so deep from reality you hide

Pain breed inside hate rules your mind
Life all time low down the way it goes
Drowning all your sorrows turning present into past
Suicide with alcohol was like going nowhere fast
Your mind was never empty but your soul was oh so bleak
And when the needle touched your tender flesh you knew it all would peak

Pain breed inside hate rules your mind
Life all time low down the way it goes

Waste no time....kill your mind....
Let it go....cleanse your soul....

More than one way to go six feet under below
We all die still we try
To achieve immortality

Pain breed inside hate rules your mind
Life all time low down the way it goes

Waste no time....kill your mind....
Let it go....cleanse your soul....

More than one way to go six feet under below
Different tools fit to use either way you will lose
