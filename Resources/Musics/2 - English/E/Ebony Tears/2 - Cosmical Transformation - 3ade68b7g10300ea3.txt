COSMICAL TRANSFORMATION

World keeps spinning round my head
Vague rejections will transcend
Truthful faith for the worlds inside
This fairyland can't be denied

Embrace me in secrecy
This world's for real not a dream
Right in my hands the fairyland
No truth can spoil my beliefs

Thoughts colliding against wonderwall
Trough the silver haze I hear your call
Truthful faith for the worlds inside
This fairyland can't be denied

Embrace me in secrecy
This world's for real not a dream
Right in my hands the fairyland
No truth can spoil my beliefs

Lost in fairyland
Lost in wonderland
