THE END

I'm falling headless downwards
Screaming like the filth inside of me
Burning like a fallen god dropped from high above
Dying to be released from it all

Filth, Hate, Angst, Against

Burning my candle in both ends
Trapped inside this mess it's no longer me
Hatred tears my soul apart
I bash my head against the wall to be free

Filth, Hate, Angst, Against
Sick of it all

It's time to leave to take the fall
I'm so tired to pretend
There's no meaning to it all i'm waiting for the end
All my power turned to grief
Dreams faded away
I'm waiting to be released no beginning without an end
