DEMON RIDE

Execute the face of fear inside for real exercise your demons
Lose control
Behind the doors of sanity, Take a trip to were
No one goes
Down and out filled with doubt I saw the truth
Through a bottle of alcohol
Several rides to hell and back, but I always
Wake up cold

Life will fade away, demons rising
Kill me again cause I don't wanna stay

Step inside the demon ride the only place
Were no one seems to win
It crushes down deletes the mind
And takes a bite of what's within
Never again but always the same insanity
You're heading for the fall
It pours down inside cripples the pride
And on my knees I always crawl

Life will fade away, demons rising
Kill me again cause I don't wanna stay

Head to the ground, nailed to the floor, broken again
Always the same, never the less, down on my knees
Fallen
Head to the ground, nailed to the floor, broken again
Always the same, never the less, down on my knees
Fallen

I bleed with such grace
I silently wait
As it kills from inside
The bottom is reached
I see with new eyes
Renewal complete

Fail, I let the demons take my mind
Pain, washed out from inside

Cold, all dead inside, end complete, life denied
No, ain't got no pride, blow my mind just let me die
