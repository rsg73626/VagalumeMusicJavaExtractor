SCENARIO

Relentless - grief is thy name
Innocence and beauty but the song remains the same
Hatred builds pressure, I'm scorned by the flame

All our scars we hide inside
To fit the puzzle we must lie
Leave your innocence behind
Deny

Screaming - but there's no one to blame
You're the one attached to all that is insane
Why keep pretending only you can stop this game

All our scars we hide inside
To fit the puzzle we must lie
Leave your innocence behind

We keep falling lust turns to apathy
Where are we going when grey insaturate our need

To serenity
