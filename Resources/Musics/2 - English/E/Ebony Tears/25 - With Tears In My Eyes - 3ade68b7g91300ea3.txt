WITH TEARS IN MY EYES

In this mournful sadness, I feel right at home. I hide my face
From your eyes. I try to carry on
My soul is burned and I've been burned for the last time
Never again will I face the pain, I won't open myself again

Sorrow is all that remains, left on the outside again
Sorrow is all that remains, left on the outside again

I fall apart but you put me back together, my heart is still broken
And a broken heart won't heal
You saturate my body, with liquid of disgust
I made love to the devil's daughter
She buried a thorn in my trust

Sorrow is all that remains, left on the outside again
Everytime it's just the same left on the outside

With tears in my eyes, and a heart still aching
In sadness I hide, to get back on my feet again
So many times, I felt this pain before
I'm not a part of this human race, all I can do is ignore

You're all dying to live
You're all dying to live but I'm living to die
I'm hollow on the inside, nothing left but a shell
But I carry on, I carry on until the end
I'm not afraid of dying, anymore

Alone on the outside looking at the inside
Alone on the outside don't wanna be inside
I respect the world you live in but I don't believe in it
I respect the world you live in but I don't believe in it

Falling, I fall in spirals of fire, losing all control
Please put me back together, help me

I'm on my way, but there's no light in this tunnel
I feel no pain, her hand embraces my soul
Emptiness, the silence has spoken
So much wait, for this voyage

Sorrow is all that remains, left on the outside again
Everytime it's just the same, left on the outside
