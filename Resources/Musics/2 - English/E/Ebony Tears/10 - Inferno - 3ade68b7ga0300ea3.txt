INFERNO

Burning... A nauseating taste
Pointles... Your life is such a waste
Bouncing and battering the beast in my skin
Aggression has come to grow
Forcing my feelings to step out of me
Relentless to the bone

Vengence      dwells inside
Fearless      I feast on your life

Screaming... My body connect with pain
Outrageous... In havoc I shall remain
Raping the cradle a life filled with sin
Forces below I adore
Your soul might be clean but this game you can't win
I'm back into the core

Vengence      dwells inside
Fearless      I feast on your life

Into inferno
Into inferno I go
