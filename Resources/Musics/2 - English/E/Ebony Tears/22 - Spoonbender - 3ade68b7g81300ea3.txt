SPOONBENDER

All the pain is mine leave your guilt behind
I'm not dying for you
All my wounds are real and my scars won't heal
A world drenched in blood

Burn my eyes, I see the world without them
Terrified, you feel my pain
Slit open the sky, and let out my stars
Look inside, it'll make you drown

Take me now, burn with your lips
Lick me free, from grey reality

My scars are whispers of...need
And shaded eyes are filled with grief
I feel you burning through my veins
Make love to me then shove me down the drain

I will never fear again...never

Come crucify me, come and nail me down
Just crucify me, all the pain is mine

I feel her roaring through my soul
She got ways to make me crawl

My scars are whispers of...need
And shaded eyes are filled with grief
I feel you burning through my veins
Make love to me then shove me down the drain
