HARVESTER OF PAIN

Beaten, torn by the invisible, the face of all disdain
Jaws of hate around my spine and i die once again
We colour our lives with useless lies and end up in misery
Always hungry we scream for more and stumble on our greed

Harvester of pain
Bring us light again

A rotten smile on a sickening faceinside this fruitless game
Always want what we can't have the things we can't gain
Intolerance instead ofsecond chance we beat the ones who bleed
We turn our backs and close our eyes to fulfull our needs

Harverster of pain
Bring us light again

Faces will lie the truth be denied
This world is fading away
Never a smile that comes from inside
A world built on fake is rotting away
