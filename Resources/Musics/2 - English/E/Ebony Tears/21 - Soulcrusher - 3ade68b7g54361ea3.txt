SOULCRUSHER

I wreck your monuments of life I destroy the dreams you build
I twist my arms around your spine 'til your pathetic blood is spilled
Life is not forever but you gave me all your trust
As a friend I gave you my own heaven so now your bones must turn to dust

I pull the trigger to ease your mind
I give you heaven instead of boredom
I deliver death sublime
I took your life but I gave you freedom

I fill you with deceitful lies and you fall on your own greed
Mankind reeks stupidity that's why I love to watch you bleed
Nothing is forever a fact you don't believe
Life got its ugly price, your soul belongs to me

I pull the trigger to ease your mind
I give you heaven instead of boredom
I deliver death sublime
I took your life but I gave you freedom

What god has sown I must reap
I ease the pain I set you free

Nothing is forever
Only death is certain
And remember your lifeblood belongs to me
