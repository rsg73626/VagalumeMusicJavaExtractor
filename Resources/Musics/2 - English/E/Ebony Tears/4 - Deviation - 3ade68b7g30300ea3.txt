DEVIATION

Out of chaos etched inside
New way of thinking state of sublime
Renewal, redemption this life is yours to form
Revalue, and question abhor the common norms

New mind, new life
Break away from standard thinking step outside the common norms

Break down deconstruct what's on the inside
Redesign what you dislike
Fall down when you reach the lowest point
You see the world through different eyes

Erase your old life redeem your soul
Come undone just let it grow
Don't waste it, consume it, convert reality
Give a life a facelift to fit your needs

New mind, new life
Break away from standard thinking step outside the common norms

Break down deconstruct what's on the inside
Redesign what you dislike
Fall down when you reach the lowest point
You see the world through different eyes

This is the way it feels
Not what it used to be

Abhor common norms
Life's yours to form
