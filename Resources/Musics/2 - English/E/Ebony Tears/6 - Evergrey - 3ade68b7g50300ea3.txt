EVERGREY

Forever, we're lost beyond a day
Tomorrow will bring bitternes and fragments of hate
Our sickening lives, will die behind
Silhouettes of evergrey and scars from yesterday

The dreams we keep inside, will surely pass us by
And when truth becomes a lie we all die
The remains of yesterday, will keep us all awake
Reality will quake and we all bleed...we will bleed

Sadness the joy that I lack are traded for
A meathook, buried in my back
Nothing can ease your pain, dancing on the edge
Soon to go insane

Downwards we go
I'm fading for sure
Downwards we all go
Evergrey

Time passes us by, and each day we die
Side by side, slowly we die

Dying we're dying
Piece by piece we're fading away season of decay
Fading we're fading

Nothingness takes our last breath, we're soon to be no more
Forever lost beyond our lives, never to return

Life is pain
In the evergrey

Life is pain
In the evergrey

The dreams we keep inside, will surely pass us by
And when truth becomes a lie we all die
The remains of yesterday, will keep us all awake
Reality will quake and we all bleed

Downwards we go
I'm fading for sure
Downwards we all go
Evergrey
