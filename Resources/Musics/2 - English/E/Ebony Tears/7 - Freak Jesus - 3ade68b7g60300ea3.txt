FREAK JESUS

Shiny like tomorrow but dead as yesterday
Moulded thoughts drowned in human day

Hand of claustrophobia tears my soul apart
Depression seems to be my only friend

Trapped in human patterns like a sculpture made of stone
Millions of people but I'm still alone
Silence surrounds me I can't communicate at all
Talking to me is like talking to a wall

Without tears it's hard to cry
Too numb to be alive
In a world shaded grey
For the fear of pain for the fear of life itself

I hide I hide inside my soul I'm a riddle for you all
You want to see me bleed but I'm not the enemy
Alone I'm hanging here. Alone crucified for you all
I've been embraced by the nails of fate

Years and years of pain my life's been coloured grey
Pain and misery no more agony
I'm nailed to your cross I hear your laughter inside of me
Trapped in a pose that's gone too far like Jesus I bleed

Without tears it's hard to cry
Too numb to be alive
In a world shaded grey
For the fear of pain for the fear of life itself

I hide I hide inside my soul I'm a riddle for you all
You want to see me bleed but I'm not the enemy
Alone I'm hanging here. Alone crucified for you all
I've been embraced by the nails of fate
