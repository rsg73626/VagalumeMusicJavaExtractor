OPACITY

Crying I cannot believe the world that I see
Is not for me
Praying please take me home
I'm here all alone and slowly I fade
If you could see my misery
Would you believe in opacity?

The hate that burns inside of me, is a furious onslaught
Caused by reality
21 long years of pain is more than I can take
I'm sick and tired of your moral standards
This world is built on fake
Cause I can see the truth, behind your every lie
I swallowed them so many times that I'm almost dead inside

I'm dreaming away from this world I hate
I'm building my own religion
Can't look back cause I'm so afraid that I will end up, just like you
You might call me suicidal, but I'm not the one to blame
I hate the way you look at me I'm not a part of this game
If you could see the truth behind each and every lie
If you could see the agony I'm building up inside

Pain is my friend
Life's just a game
Take me away from here

I push away the shades of grey that seem to be my fate
I replace my joy with agony cause I survive on hate
I run away from this world of pain I hide inside my mind
I'm living in the opacity you left me behind

Heal my wounds. Burn all my sorrow
Make me smile. After tomorrow
I hide, in a gloomy state of mind, take a look inside
And pain is what you'll find
All alone, and solitude surrounds me it feels like home
Nothing can hurt me
Heal my wounds
Burn all my sorrow
Make me smile. After tomorrow
