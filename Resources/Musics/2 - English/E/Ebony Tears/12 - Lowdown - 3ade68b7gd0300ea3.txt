LOWDOWN

Apathy this life is plain boredom
No will to live and I couldn't care the fuck less
It raped all my dreams and distorted my visions
Replaced my joy with sorrow
I'm drained on emotions no longer inspired
This life has no tomorrow

The confusion, what really happened inside my head
No solution, sometimes I wonder if we're all dead

Break me down just reap what I have sown
One last try before the final dawn
I reach down inside I take hold of myself
To leave this private hell
And when everything fails I seek trust in denial
Cause life had taught me well

Still confusion, what really happened inside my head
No solution, sometimes I wonder if we're all dead

Dehumanized, Broken
More dead than alive, I let go of this world

Fucked up inside cause the cuts are to deep
Deprived of my life I'm a negative creep
Depression had conquered the resistance inside
The pain is unreal yet I'm faking a smile

Still confusion, what really happened inside my head
No solution, sometimes I wonder if we're all dead

Dehumanized, Broken
More dead than alive, I let go of this world
Worn down - dehumanized - no more strength - broken
Unreal - more dead than alive - now - I let go of this world
