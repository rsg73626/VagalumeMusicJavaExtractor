OUTRAGED

I saw your ugly face again and I despise the way you crawl
You reek of lies and hypocrisy and all your values are so dismal
Always the same you passing judgment and blame cause you're afraid of what you oppose
I'm an error in your perfection cause my soul can not be bought

Take a look in my eyes
And now you realize
I won't step aside
Now you know I'm for real
So what's the god damn deal?
Are you afraid to die?

Learned my ways from past mistakes but you are surely sinking low
With your well designed lies and a fake smile you sell your ass to be a part of the show
So you're taken me for an imbecile I swear I'll break your fucking bones
Spreading your shit behind my back just give us 5 minutes alone

Take a look in my eyes
And now you realize
I won't step aside
Now you know I'm for real
So what's the god damn deal?
Are you afraid to die?

You play the game so face the pain there's no escape
So you believe you're more than me? You're god damn wrong

In lead....no fucking god is over me
Strength, hate....your god damn norms won't set me straight

Eye for an eye I won't step aside there's no use you keep denying
Can you feel my hate? Now there's no escape my adrenaline is rising
