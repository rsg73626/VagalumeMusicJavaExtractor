INVOLUNTARY EXISTENCE

Defected perfection another truth so full of lies
Corrosive laughter is all that's left inside my mind
I follow my instincts, I try so hard to understand
No more choices. Now I'm stuck what a shame

I know there's no meaning to carry on but still I try
Involuntary existence life sucks then you die

Looking at the world with sewn shut eyes
Bouncing against walls but I'm still alive
Trapped within myself I'm lost somehow
Tired of it all

My eyes won't tell you nothing
My eyes will burn through you
My eyes won't tell you nothing
My eyes are true

I believe you people lost your sense of humor
Cause you don't laugh when I bleed
But I find it somewhat peculiar. You call me cynical
While you get fucked by reality

I'm intransigent I don't care your words are non existant
So I find it peculiar you calling me cynical
While you get fucked by reality

Get out of my way. Got nothing to say to you anyway
Leave me alnoe. You're full of it

Don't say a word I read your mind you're left behind
Get out of my way blind leads blind

Looking at the world with sewn shut eyes
Bouncing against walls but I'm still alive
Trapped within myself I'm lost somehow
Tired of it all

My eyes won't tell you nothing
My eyes will burn through you
My eyes won't tell you nothing

My eyes...

Are true
