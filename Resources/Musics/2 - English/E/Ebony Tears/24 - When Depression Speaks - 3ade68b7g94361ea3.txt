WHEN DEPRESSION SPEAKS

Depression is calling
Its face has been shown
Direction nowhere
A world painted black

And when I reach the highest point
It finally crushes me down
All my dreams are now withdrawn
As it slowly infects my soul

I feel no desire
My lust is gone
Hatred and denial
Is burning my soul

And when I reach the highest point
It finally crushes me down
All my dreams are now withdrawn
As it slowly infects my soul

When depression speaks through me
My soul i shut, sealed
When depression speaks through me
I bleed

I'm going down for real
My soul is now revealed
