SUPERHERO

Everywhere is freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies, tell me where is sanity
Tax the rich, feed the poor
Till there are no rich no more?

We were all created with potential to become superheroes
We all have the power to cause change in this world
This is how I choose to use my power

I had a dream I lived in a world of discrimination
Different races raising killers and rapers
Felt like I live in the matrix, so I awakened
This is the case: day to day on minimum wage
End of the day I'm still in maze
Amazing

My soul bleeds
For millis of dough and rollies
I meanted to show the globe I'm more than an image
I'm more like a trophy
So please
Gimme your cents
Am I worth your frickin' respect
Am I wrong you're really the best - yes

Fuck the world it's nothing changed
Diseases, wars and toxic rain
Cities going up in flames
Gather the nations lock 'em up in chains
Demolish
Apocalypse now accomplished
We live in eternal darkness
Forever (forever)

If we can catch the sight of green
Chop off a piece
Just take a minute to breathe
We can agree
Love is all that we need
And let us so perceive
We can change the world a day at a time
Before it's too late to rewind
Or we can remain in the grind
I leave it to you

So if you ever need a superhero to save the day
You should be looking inside
See I believe that I'm a superhero
But I can't do it alone
So if you ever need a superhero to save the day

I leave it up to you
I leave it up to you
I leave it up to you
