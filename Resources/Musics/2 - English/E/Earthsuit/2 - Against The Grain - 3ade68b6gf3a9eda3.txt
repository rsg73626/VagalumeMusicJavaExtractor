AGAINST THE GRAIN

You wanna strangle me, then here's my neck
You ain't got the strength to flex so fess
You wanna get all up in my destiny
Haughty rules and words that hinder me
Go and teach men's commandments from afar, it's who you are and you dare
Build a dam on the spiritual real; your ruling is appealed

I've been sent to your boat to rock it
Men flood hell while your hands are in your pocket
You separate from the life source and endorse
And force secret religious codes like morse
Constraints, why do you seize us? Just give me Jesus
I'll be free in this unruly world
Nowhere to hide, I'm going untied

Suffocation... Where's it come from; exhalation
Throw religion
I go up against the grain

You're like boa constriction, don't lube the friction
Spiritual got impeached like Nixon
Anorexic generation x result by default the inner man assault
Beat to a pulp confined from the river and no limbs for the body
Prodigals are being forced to eat pig's food
When the church has a feast for this starving crew
You cannot ever muzzle me from reprimanding what puzzles me
The rigid formalities of mankind that choke the hidden man
As you proclaim "Let us make God in our own image"
And when you're finished you've manipulated my passion
I'll come out thrashing
The sky turns red as I migrane the head

Suffocation... Where's it come from; exhalation
Throw religion
I go up against the grain

Liberty is what we need
Father set us free
Liberty is what we need
Father set us free

Go up against the grain, I'm untied
Go up against the grain
