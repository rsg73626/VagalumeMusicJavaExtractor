SCHIZOPHRENIAC

Enslaved to silence I
See the free
But in schiz I surely stay

It is much easier to
Change your tune
When you song ain't being played

Youth Camp junkies don't get enough to make the buzz last
Where ya'll at, where ya'll at
Youth Camp junkies don't get enough to make the buzz last
heads up seven up to the schizophreniac

Schizophreniac...Schizophreniac
I see the stone faced to the one way track
Schizophreniac...Schizophreniac
Heads up seven up to the schizophreniac

Easy I flake out as
I speak the words that my soul don't wanna say
Changing my colors as focus brings out
My subtle shades of grey

Well it's the brain child from the histile, people of the rock
Got 66 rounds of schizophrenic sounds
Yet I stress in the realm of the mental
No rental cause for applause like yental
Gentle on the wire 'cause I rock the gondola
A string habitat
Spare me no room for the fat
Pat the ground with the head that much prefer the clouds
The mind of the Pahrisee is subject to the gravity
We must avoid the gravity

Don't show ya heads 'round here 'cause you're bound to lose 'em
The strain will make ya choose 'em
