BLOODSHOT FANATICAL

Living on no sleep, shell shocked, this love has got me grid-locked 
Look into my eyes, I'm running straight bloodshot 
Devoted patriot, I've been up all night long 
Some may find it somewhat wrong but now what else you got 
Should I lay my head to rest waiting for another day? 
Should I stop to smell the roses like the wise men say? 
This drive inside of me is killing me and I deserve it 
I feel myself fading and I'm still convinced it's worth it 

I'm running it bloodshot fanatical 
Can't take time for sabbatical 
Won't make this mathematical 
I'm running straight bloodshot 

(Every day and every night, I'm running bloodshot fanatical 
All I know is running like bloodshot fanatical) 

Yes, you best believe it's mandatory for the test 
I?m making all my time invest 
And won't be settling for less 
You won't catching me off guard; I'm playing that die-hard 
Even if it's making no sense 
Time stand still I know that next hour's creeping 
I'm at it always never stopping, never sleeping 
Finally, yes, I've found something I can give my life to 
Don't think I could ever stop even if I'd like to 

No sleep, shell shocked 
All space grid locked 
But I'll give what I've got 
I'm running straight bloodshot
