SAID THE SUN TO THE SHINE

I'm like Parhelion, Earth's daystar
I'm like a luminary wizard, just like you are
I'm like a night incinerator, burning time
I got planet's radiating, solar system in the waiting
Integrating life lines carry on with your shine, shine

Everyone knows whether night or day
Find the light of dawn, you will carry on
Everyone knows whether night or day, carry on, carry on

Said the Sun to the Shine
Said the Sun to the Shine
Come shadow what you find
Said the Sun to the Shine
Said the Sun to the Shine
You and I forever bind
Said the Sun to the Shine

I am the light of life the brilliant morning star
And I have made you in my image
I am just like you are
Be my reflection to this world
You're my unique design
I got planet's radiating, solar system in the waiting
Integrating life lines carry on with your shine, shine
Said the Sun to the Sunshine
Said the Sun to the Sunshine
