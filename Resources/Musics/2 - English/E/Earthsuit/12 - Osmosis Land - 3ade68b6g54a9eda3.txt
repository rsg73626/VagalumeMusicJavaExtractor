OSMOSIS LAND

Every night and every single day
The sun will rise, the moon it will fade
And in our web idols were spun
Caught up in oblivion

So we come with the song, come with the sword
Come with the image of the Son
Come with the song, come with the sword
What we behold we become

Living in osmosis land
Living in osmosis land
Come on and bring up, bring the swing
Everybody get up
Bring up, bring the swing, let my God erupt
In this land of Osmosis
Come on and bring up, bring the swing
Everybody get up
Bring up, bring the swing, let my God erupt
In this land of Osmosis

I'm not the same as I ever was like the box of Pandora
Never to be the duplicate of old forms of order
Whenever the eyes seem to rip off and go
I run to the flow, there's a stream for my soul
Send me over, send me over
I'm coming up out of the brick and the mortar
To break up all of the disorder
I want to become forever the essence of the Son
Abide like the tundra in the Rain

Pride to the side
Let the inner man crowd get up
In osmosis land a bland house erupts
Frequently injected sterilize eyes infected
Noise rock on 'cause I ain't had enough

Migrate to the edge
Earthsuits in a pile
You'll never find the promise land while soakin' in the Nile
I'd like to take a surge where I know I'll be not like Enoch
And escalate

God above invade my soul
I become what I behold
