DESERT DREAMS

The desert shall bloom just like a rose 
Oasis will appear 
The parched land become a pool 
The desert shall bloom in majesty 
The barren will conceive 
Spring forth with perfect life 

Desert dreams are what we dream 
We see visions of that stream 
Waking up the thirsty sand 
Desert dreams and nothing less 
We must make this wilderness 
Make it blossom like the promise land 

The desert shall bloom just like a rose 
Chosen people sing 
The riverbanks will overflow 
The desert shall bloom in majesty 
Lift up your eyes and see 
The clouds and feels the rain
