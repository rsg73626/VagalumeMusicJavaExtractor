DO YOU ENJOY THE DISTORTION?

Do you enjoy the distortion?
Stompbox yourself to the ground
Do you enjoy the distortion?
Mad fuzz give birth to the sound

Are you singing...

Oh, fascinate me
Just fixate the distortion
Don't complicate me
It's so easy like this now

Do you enjoy the distortion?
It's amplifying my brain
Do you enjoy the distortion?
That overdrives you insane

Well are you singing...

Distort, rock you head back and forth
Mad fuzz give birth to the sound
Clear your mind of the fuzz that you see
With the one that lives within you greater is He
Distortion will rock your head back and forth
Mad fuzz give birth to the sound
It'll rock your head back and forth

Listen for the sound
Distortion, it will rock your head
Back and forth
