WHITEHORSE

Whitehorse  Back to Top

Searching high with a yellow soul
I dig for ashes in a sea of gold
Drifting low, my yellow soul
I'll live on air if the clouds will hold

Jesus riding on a white horse
Hero calling from the sky
Jesus riding on a white horse
With spare room for you and I to fly
Riding on a white horse high
Wanna ride, wanna ride so high
On a white horse high
Sail high on the ocean sky

Searching high with a yellow soul
There's no tomorrow in the days of old
I was falling low, my yellow soul
It's sad to burn, left in the cold
