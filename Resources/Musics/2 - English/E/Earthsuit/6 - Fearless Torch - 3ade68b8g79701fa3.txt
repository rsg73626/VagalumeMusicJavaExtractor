FEARLESS TORCH

Whoever sets the drama 
I'll kick scripts I flip 
Add some trauma to your pack then 
I ain't actin' 
I score a fat ten 
Back when I'm on the spot 
The verse came cerebal 
Walkin' through the valleys and I fear no evil 
Cuz I'm a fearless torch goin' off 
I heard you cough from the cumbustion of my skenchy flesh 
Ask yourself this, who can make the sun rise? 
The Son of Man can, and he will like Rick Cua 
With wonders he will lure 
Pursue you from the sewer of the trap 
As I attack with the Scriptures 
My sound Red October 
I find a lyrical chaeuffer 
That stands out, and yet the handout is not over 

Now that I'm flaming let me burn 
Now that I'm flaming let me burn 
LET ME BURN! 
LET ME BURN! (You got ta, you got ta) 
LET ME BURN! 
LET ME BURN! 

Now I wonder what's the way 
To wonderland now who's the man 
I run to God I'll understand 
And alleluia as I come with the 
Underground mix 
Holy Ghost fix 
Long live the kicks when you hear the clicks 
66 kinds of chambers 
Loaded with holy tripped lead 
Double-barrel aimed with infrared 
But I'm a soldier so I'm blasting out hard 
Gripping, capping, for the will of God 
Sheeps in wolves' clothing with no regret 
So what you see is what you get 
No religion for your intellect 

Now, now that I'm flaming, let me burn 
God lit my fire, now it's my turn 
Satan's been stompin' on me too long 
Now it's time for me to get it on! 

LET ME BURN! (You got ta) 
LET ME BURN! (You got ta, you got ta) 
LET ME BURN! (You got ta) 
LET ME BURN! 

Let me burn 
I'm a fearless torch 
I'm burning 
Now that I'm flaming 
Keep me burnin' (etc.) 
Now that I'm flaming, let me burn
