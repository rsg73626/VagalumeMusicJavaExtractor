WONDER

Speak up sir and clearly state your name
Did you say you are the Son and came to save
How in my right mind should I believe
That a life exists beyond what I perceive

Change all my fear to faith in you

I'm forgetting all I know and I'm leaning on Your love
Yes, I see now...All Your Wonder
My mind will now make room for all the truth that is in You
And I see now...All Your Wonder

Let me journey to the unveiled place
Where my selfish wills and ways become untraced
Suddenly my vision's getting clear
When I see the answers reasons disappear
