SKY FLASHINGS

Who keeps the balance in suspended skies
Supporting Earth with inward thrust
Let the audience refocus eyes
On all sky flashings in front of us

Who's seen in the midst of unsealing skies
It's revelation that all can see
And yet our hearts remain hushed inside
Mindless of fantasia we enjoy for free

It takes a miracle, kaleidoscope superior
Spinning vortex, bleeding shades of night to day

Sovereign pictures center stage
Genius of the cosmic craze
Days and nights keep on and on
God abroad in blended song

In our sky flashings

Who can deny this pure design
Emanating views never seen
Revealing art to mortal minds
Entranced in our phantasmic dreams
