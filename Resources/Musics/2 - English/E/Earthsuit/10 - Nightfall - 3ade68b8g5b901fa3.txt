NIGHTFALL

Night falls and the day breaks 
Cycle through the seasons but you?ll only find the future 
In the nightfall 

There?s midnight inside morning?s song 
But no one wants to face it 
Ambitious night is burnt and gone 
Only daybreak can replace it 

Have you ever seen yourself inside a moment tainted 
With tragedies that tell the story that your life created 

Loss reflects hope to gain 
The darkness leave you jaded 
Progress is attached to pain 
But nightfall?s almost faded
