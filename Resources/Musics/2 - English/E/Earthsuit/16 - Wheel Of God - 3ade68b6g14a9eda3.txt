WHEEL OF GOD

I wanna ride on the wheel of God
While it's spinnin' 'round
I wanna ride on that wheel, while it's spinnin' 'round

Wheel within a wheel within...wheel within a mighty wheel
Wheel within a wheel within...wheel within a mighty wheel

I wanna go where no man on Earth has gone before
You know I do
I wanna go where no man's gone before

I saw a wheel way high up in the air and I said
I'm gonna ride that wheel today, today

We'll go where no one's gone before
We'll see what no one's seen before
We'll go where no one's gone before
It's a wheel within a mighty wheel
