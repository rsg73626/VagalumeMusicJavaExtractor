ONE TIME

Follow me down the road
To the realms of the rhyme
People of the rock come and rock one time
When we bring the sound
You know the light of God shine
Poeple of the rock come and rock one time
Anyone thirst there's plenty of new wine
People of the rock come and rock one time
Make me feel so fine all of but all the time
People of the rock and the father
To come and fill us

One time, one time, one time, one time, one time

Everybody body get your hands up
And grab for more new wine that's falling more than you can stand up
Got the vision for the rough terrain, desolate the sane
Lord, hit me one time, infiltrate the mind
Everybody, everybody, body, body
Everybody, body, body
Everybody, body, body
It's a one time shot

Father, come and fill us one time, one time
Father, come and fill us

Smoke from the wick, yesterday burnt the candle
Daily shots are all than I can handle
I see you've gone blind
You want to find the philosophies of the Play-Doh man
But you can't because it's a spectacle
Everybody, everybody, body, body
Everybody, body, body
Everybody, body, body
It's a one time shot

Do re mi fa so la ti do ti la so fa me re do
I warm up my tongue to engage in a lyrical war
Now I'm ready to go
So I reckon the second I'm decking and checking
And wrecking the mic yo
I've got the kingdom of darkness talking that I am a psycho
Earthsuit is in the house, so figure out what the deal is
I'm gripping the mic and I'm flipping it right
And you've got to get ready to hear this
I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
Funkmounth to bootcha

The Father to come and fill us one time
