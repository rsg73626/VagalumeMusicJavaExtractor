LADY WISDOM

Listen, Lady Wisdom pleads 
Calling out to simple minds 
As they look within themselves 
They all look within themselves 

They make gods out of earthly things 
Satisfy themselves with other things 
All men like sheep have gone astray 
Drifting far as she cries for them to stay 

They turn away, they turn away 
The good advice they ricochet 
They turn away, they turn away 
Life was on the table, but they turned away 

The foolish look past Lady Wisdom 
Blinded only by their eyes 
They build houses of sound 
Oh, they build a house of sand 

Drifting far, where have they gone? 
Drifting far, where have they gone? 
Drifting far, where have they gone? 
Drifting far as she cries for them to stay 
Folly's found her way into the hearts of many men 
And the company she keeps now lies alone down in the sand
