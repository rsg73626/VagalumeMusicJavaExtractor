GUMMY BUFFALO

Now come to where imagination exists 
A little black, a little white, a little gray, a little twist 
Everything's bliss, though my nature resists 
I'm breaking down, I'm breaking through, I?m breaking off, I'm breaking this 
No explanation as I dress the canvas 
The world is much nicer when the world's anonymous 
It's all paper clouds raining blue snow on a gummy buffalo 

I've been dreaming of gummy buffalo 
And believing that's just the way it goes 
They've been scheming the sounds we don't know 
I've been dreaming about gummy buffalo 

It's a state of mind, somewhere to fall 
A place to live, a place to die, a place to run, a place to crawl 
And yet I seem to be getting nowhere at all 
Give it up, give it in, give it a try, give it a call 
I walk the corridors, walk the shores, walk the floors 
Take the doors that can lead me to the roars 
And all the sounds that are coming from the show of the gummy buffalo 

They said watch this, watch this 

Here I can cover my mistakes, rewind and try again 
If I get spooked out I wake myself up and then 
I?ll take a breath, close my eyes, re-enter in 
This little world of gummy buffalo that never seems to end
