RUMP SHAKER

Girl's got my attention, right above the thigh
If a body catch a body runnin' through the rye

(chorus)
What did he say, who did he mean.
She's got the finest rump I have ever seen, yea yea
Rump Skaker!

I get so excited, use my new degree
She's a gem, a specimen for some proctology

(chorus)

Don't just like the big ones, I don't just like them small
I'm a Rudy Valentino, I just want it all
