LOCKED IN THE CHAPEL OF LOVE

Long, long day
I'm getting very tired
The sun's gone down
And I'm stuck her for a while
Because I'm locked in the chapel of love
I'm locked in the chapel of love

Locked inside, I start to suffocate
It's cold inside and a ladder would be great
Because I'm locked in the chapel of love
I'm locked in the chapel of love and

(chorus)
ooooo, ooooo,
ooooo, ooooo, (etc.)
Ding dong ding, yeah the bells will be tollin'
Ding dong ding, when I'm married in the mornin'
Ding dong ding, yes I'm locked in the chapel of love

I've locked myself inside this chapel now
But you don't call my name
I've tried to be the man you've waited for
Now looks as though you've gone now and,

chorus

Long, long day
I'm getting very tired
The sun's gone down
And I'm stuck her for a while
Because I'm locked in the chapel of love
I'm locked in the chapel of love
My single days are thrown away in vain
The pew's no bed and the nuns drive me insane
Because I'm locked in the chapel of love
I'm locked in the chapel of love
