COME BACK TO ME

Too much of nothing comes waiting for you
Just hope that something will surface somethig new
The distance grows now,
The length of time
Something is gone and I'm sure that it was mine

(chorus)
I used to walk miles for you
I still enjoy smiles from you
We'll be together in the end
Too much of nothing will disappear then

Too much of nothing comes waiting on you
I'd count the days and I hoped that you would too
That distant look now you had all the time
The empty feeling was always in your mind

chorus

You will come back to me
You will find and you will see
That we are much to young
