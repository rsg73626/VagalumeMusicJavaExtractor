DORM ROOM

Hey can I stay
Another evening inside your dorm room
No, I can't go
Even though the morning will come soon
Why, are you shy?
Look, your roommate seems to be sleeping
Oooh, you got that smirk!
What on heaven's earth are you thinking?

Hey, got away
Without a written invitation
Hey, got an A
On your continuing education
Why are you shy?
Look, your roommate seems to be winking
Oooh, you've got that look!
What on heaven's earth are you thinking?
