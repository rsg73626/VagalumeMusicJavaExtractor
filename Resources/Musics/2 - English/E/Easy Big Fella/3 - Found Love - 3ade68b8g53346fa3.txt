FOUND LOVE

I found love in many places
I found love in many faces
I found love to end all love
But it ended up a shame

I found love in hallway
On a balcony, in a train
I found loves institution
And I ended up insane

In found love in a graveyard
At 11:59
Waitin' for the clock to strike,
To tell me it's time

To take this sad life,
And wash it down the drain,
And pick up the bottle
To flush it out my brain

I found love at the bottom,
And I took it to the top
But I can't seem to shake it, 
So I tell you to stop
STOP!
