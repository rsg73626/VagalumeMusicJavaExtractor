WE DON'T HAVE TO GO NOW

Tracked her to this tavern
In this god-forsaken town
She's the one who made off with my motorcycle bike
With a helmet of gold
And a tatoo of a toad
Gonna get that rude
Gonna get that scoot
And take it on the road....

(chorus)
One More Stout, Boys it's a no-show
One more bad night at the go go
Arrest heh, she stole my Vespa
Arrest heh, she stole my Vespa
We don't have to go now....

Met her at the party
And thought she knew my friends
Asked her out, she gave the shout
And Mike the Bike was in!
She took me to a dance hall
And had me go inside
She took my keys
She took my ride, and now she's gonna die!!!

(chorus)

We don't have to go now
We don't have to go now
We don't have to go now
We don't have to go now
Stop, stop, stop
She's callin' the cops, cops, cops
Stop, stop, stop
She's callin' the cops, cops, cops and doughnuts

Tracked her to this tavern
In this god-forsaken town
She's the one who made off with my motorcycle bike
With a helmet of gold
And a tatoo of a toad
Gonna find that rude and get my scoot and take it on the road
One more Stout
