REGULAR GUY

He was regular guy with a regular girl
He was a regular family man
He had a regular dog and a regular son
They had a regular life, they had regular fun

Think I'll get a gun and shoot my wife and kids
I better think it through
Two more homicides, baby and I'll be home with you
Don't you know it's true

He had a regular job and a regular boss
He was a regular working man
He had a regular car and a regular home
He was regular guy, he was a regular Joe 

Think I'll get a gun and shoot my wife and kids
I better think it through
Sell them to the mob, or sell them to the zoo
Which one should I do?

Think I'll get a gun and shoot my wife and kids

Sell them to the mob, or sell them to the zoo
