THE ROAD ALONE

Won't find love in this old town,
Now I've gone and let her down
Is this a new chance in life,
Or I'd blow it all, you fool?
Whose gonna love me late at night,
Kiss my words and make it right?
Am I gonna find someone just like you?

(Chorus x2)
I've got to walk the road alone,
Whose gonna love me now you're gone?
Am I gonna find someone just like you?

All my life I've thought that heaven's just a room
Just hold a seat, my love, and I will be there soon
The road's to long I fear
The end is coming now
Take me in, show me how

Grab my bags and hit the road,
Clothes and guilt make up my load
Is this the place I'd thought I'd be,
Or I'd blow it all you fool?
Whose gonna love me late at night?
Kiss my wounds and make it right?
Am I gonna find someone just like you?
I've got to walk the road alone
