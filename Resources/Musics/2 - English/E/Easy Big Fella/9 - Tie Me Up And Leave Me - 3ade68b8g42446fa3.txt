TIE ME UP AND LEAVE ME

Day dreamed this morning, took me back about ten years,
To a time before you ever moved up here.

(chorus)
Ooh if you think it's over, ooh if you think it's over,
Tie me up and leave me on the bed and lock the door.

It's not that I don't like you, it's something that I have to say.
It seems to me that things were better the old way.

(chorus)

Long gone days, where've they gone?
It's over, it's over.

Nightmares this evening, lost in a sea of hope and fear.
Of a life alone without you being near.

(chorus)

Long gone days, where they've gone?
It's over, it's over.
It's over, it's over.
