WALK ALONE

I walk alone

Tonight I'm so happy with this day
tonight don't wanna' leave so far away
I'm not afraid whatever has to come
from the my first time just to the end of life

I walk alone right from the start
I found a way to believe in our life
My future is coming in series of lights
My disillutions are so far behind

I walk alone walk to the sky
there is no need to come back and to hie
I feel born to hold in the world in my arms
that's how how I feel anywhere anytime
train 
I walk alone

I walk alone

B-B-Bass

I walk alone right from the start
I found a way to believe in our life
My future is coming in series of lights
My disillutions are so far behind

I walk alone walk to the sky
there is no need to come back and to hie
I feel born to hold in the world in my arms
that's how how I feel anywhere anytime
I walk alone

I walk alone
