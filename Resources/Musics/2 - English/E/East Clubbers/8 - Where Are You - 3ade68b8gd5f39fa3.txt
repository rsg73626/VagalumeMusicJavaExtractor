WHERE ARE YOU

Where are you now?
Why did you go?
What I Feel Now?
You'll nerver know

Where are you now?
Why did you go?
I love you so
And i should never let you go

One day, Break into my heart
One night, Leaving all behind
One smiley is always not enough
One love

For you I can change my life
For you I can reach the sky
With you I can fly so high
I love you And my love will never die!

'Cause i love you so!
