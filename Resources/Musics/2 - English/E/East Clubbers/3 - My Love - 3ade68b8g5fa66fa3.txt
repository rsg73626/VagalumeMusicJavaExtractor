MY LOVE

You were love of my life 
I am supposed to be with you?
My angel, my sky, 
Was it not enough for you?

So many nights we spent together 
Different point of view was building our love, 
Now our feelings are so real like imitation leather 
How will I find myself if you will take my heart away

You were love of my life 
Ain't I supposed to be with you?
My angel, my sky, 
Was it not enough for you?

My love yeahhh....yeahhh... 

You were love of my life 
Ain't I supposed to be with you?
My angel, my sky, 
It was not enough for you!

You were love of my life 
It really sacrifice 
Finally has burned out and
Now my heart is cold as ice 

So many nights we spent together

I never in life, I know it's the same 
Forget about your promise just let it be this way 
You get this over I've got to run away 

You were love of my life 
Ain't I supposed to be with you?

Finally has burned out and
