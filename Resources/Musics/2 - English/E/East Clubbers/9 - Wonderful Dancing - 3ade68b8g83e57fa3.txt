WONDERFUL DANCING

Lights falling down to me
Makes me feel embrace 
Just another wonderful dancing  
Hear, I am not a queen 
You are not a king 
Just another wonderful dancing 
Lies falling down to me
makes me breathe in deem
Just another wonderful dancing 
Hear, I am not a queen
You are not a king 
Just another wonderful dancing 

Just another wonderful dancing 

Lights falling down to me
Makes me feel embrace 
Just another wonderful dancing  
Hear, I am not a queen 
You are not a king 
Just another wonderful dancing 
Lies falling down to me
makes me breathe in deem
Just another wonderful dancing 
Hear, I am not a queen
You are not a king 
Just another wonderful dancing
