BEAT IS COMING

Look at my face I can hear you
Just how I feel I will tell you
Wake up and start feel emotions
When you're dancing on the club

We are the kings of the music
I wanna be you're illusion
Wake up and start feel disire
When the beat is coming up

The beat is coming up

Look at my face I can hear you
Just how I feel I will tell you
Wake up and start feel emotions
When you're dancing on the club

We are the kings of the music
I wanna be you're illusion
Wake up and start feel disire
When the beat is coming up

And sometimes
I wanna see the sunshine
The night is cold
I can freeze so hard

And sometimes 
I wanna see the starlight
The moon is dark
We can see the stars forever
