MORE TO ME THAN MEAT AND EYES

Don't know how much more I can take
Constant abuse from Master Shake
I know he thinks that I'm just a
Stupid wad of meat with a stupid mind

I feel like no one can relate
To a ball of meat who changes shapes
Give meat a chance and you will find
There's more to me than meat and eyes

They may not think I'm very smart
Takes brains to pull this danger cart
Back in my youth I was na√Øve
Now the moon men knights have corrupted me

This all should come as no surprise
You knew soon one day I would rise
Give meat a chance and you will find
There's more to me than meat and eyes
