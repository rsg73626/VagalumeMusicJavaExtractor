JUNKIN' MIND

Now i pushin my head and in my eyes everithing make so clear
Oh, and then i'll make note of your falls and the rest of my blows
so your god could him help me to get out of the lessons that you learn
Go on and make to please you, that's all that i expected from your love

(Refrão)

I won't tell and come to stay
I won't mend and trade your blame 2x

At the day i was born a course was launch up on me
Oh, in my pocket you'll find a piece of your nicelest hot cum

So you force me shit this days

(Refrão)

I won't tell and come to stay
I won't mend and trade your blame
