WHERE YOU CAME FROM

Oh I can hear you
And I can definitely see you
Ooh
Calling

Another problem
That you can't control
While I'm here
Working

Form a line
Form a line
You get nothing
But I'll keep hoping

My hands are bleeding
From learning to stand
But you think it's just flying

It's not fair you made it
Ooh ooh
It's not fair you made it

I wanna break you but I don't know how
I wanna break you but I don't know how

Watch them all line up
With nothing to say
When the hand you've been holding

Is taken from you
And you can't let it go
Well it's hard to have everything

It's not fair you made it
Ooh ooh
It's not fair you made it

I wanna break you but I don't know how
I wanna break you but I don't know how
