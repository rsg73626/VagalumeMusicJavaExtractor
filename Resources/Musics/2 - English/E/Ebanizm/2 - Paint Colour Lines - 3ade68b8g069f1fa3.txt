PAINT COLOUR LINES

When I see you I find
how to change my own life
and to break my mind

When I touch you I find
how to paint colour lines
and to break my mind

Ch:
Break my mind
Paint colour lines
Break my mind


When I kiss you I find
That I'm no longer blind
and to break my mind

When I drink your sweet wine
And your screams are devine
You can take my mind
