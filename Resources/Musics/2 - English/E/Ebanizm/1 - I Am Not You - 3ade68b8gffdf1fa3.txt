I AM NOT YOU

I don't need your only true god
I don't want your war for peace
I despise your self-righteous crusade
I am not you, just let me be

Ch:
I am not you
I am not you
Just let me be


I have no use for your religion
You can't tell me who I am
I don't care about your good heaven
I am not afraid of your hell
