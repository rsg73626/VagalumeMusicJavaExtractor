TURN ME ON

For the longest while we jamming in the Party
And you went in on me
Pushing everything 
Right back on top of me
yeah hey

But if you think you're gonna get away from me you
Better change your mind
You're going home.......
You're going home with me tonight

Let me hold you 
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on ......

Let me down you 
Girl wine
All around me 
You got me going crazy
You Turn me on 
Turn me on ......

One hand on the ground and 
Bumper cock sky high
Went hard on me
You went and got the Python
Hollerin' for mercy - yea hey 
Then I whisper in her ear 
So wine harder
And then she said to me
Boy just push that thing in
Push it harder back on me

Let me hold you 
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on ......

Let me down you 
Girl wine
All around me 
You got me going crazy
You Turn me on 
Turn me on ......

(rap)
