ON MY WAY

Oh
It was on my way
To my gurlies house
Were supposed to meet her at 5
It was on my way
(Yo you know what happened to me
when I was going on my way to my
gurlies house huh aight check this out)

It was on my way
To my gurlies house
Where we supposed to meet her at 5
Hey yeah

As I drove my car
I saw this cutie standing in the bus stop
Hey yeah

It was like raining real heavy
(Her face was coming right at)
But her eyes still kept on mine
(This girl that we messed with)

It was on my way
To my gurlies house
Were supposed to meet her at 5
Hey yeah

Refrein:
Hey what to do
When u got a girl
And someone new
Steps into your life
Hey yeah
Do, do you make a move
Do you play a girl for a fool?
For someone new
Hey yeah

I drove on
But I changed my mind
Cause I couldn’t let her go
Hey yeah
In her we thought
She thought me seasons fall
But the things are doing her way
Hey yeah

We felt the heat of passion
(Started kissing caressing)
On a backseat of my benzie
When my girl kept on waiting

It was on my way
To my gurlies house
Were supposed to meet her at 5

Ooh baby yeah yeah
