SHE'S SOMETHING ELSE

Tonight we all smell the same 
In the dark we look cool 
So it's safe to turn off your brain 
And what was that? 
I'm so really really really I'm 
Something else completely 

Can't hear me, can't see me 
It's so much better this way 
Believe me she's really 
Something else completely 
Something else completely 

Show yourself in the perfect light 
You kick them in so refuses 
Communicate in sounds all so mono-syllabic 
And hello girls 

Yeah I'm so really really I'm really 
I'm just something else completely 

Can't hear me, can't see me 
It's so much better this way 
Believe me she's really 
Something else completely 
Something else completely 

Can't hear me, can't see me 
It's so much better this way 
Believe me she's really 
Something else completely 

Can't hear me, can't see me 
It's so much better this way 
Believe me she's really 
Something else completely 

Something else
