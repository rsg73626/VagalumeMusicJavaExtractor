A LOT OF MILES FROM HOME

Sun shine heavy like it hasn't rained for years
Wrapped in cotton, for a little protection here
The lines you've drawn under your sleeve
They keep you far away from me
But I'll take you someplace cool

If you don't want to talk about it
Well, that's alright with me
If you don't want to talk about it
That's alright with me

Hey Goodlookin'
We're a lot of miles from home
And ten years older than it felt an hour ago
This can wait another day
Everybody wants to talk and talk and talk
But there's nothing left to say

If you don't want to talk about it
Well, that's alright with me
If you don't want to be without it
Well, that's alright with me

Hey Goodlookin'
We're 'lot of miles from home
That's alright with me
