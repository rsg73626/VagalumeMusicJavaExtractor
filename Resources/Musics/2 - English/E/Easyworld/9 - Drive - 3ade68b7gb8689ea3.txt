DRIVE

Driving by your house, but you don't live here now
It's not even on my way, But I wanted think on how
It felt to walk this road, all the years before
We were hardened to it all

Driving by the park, we loved when we were young
Before you turned so strange, oh where have you gone
I walked you down this road, only years before

We were hardened to it all
Hardened to it all
Hardened to it all
We are

Jamie moved away, grew up and got a job
I've seen him now and then
He says he's happy but he's not
He's still the boy he was, only years before

We were hardened to it all
Hardened to it all
All you can never hope to change, because the fight is so unclean
All you defeatists raise your hands, and grease the old machine
Until you're hardened to it all
We are
Not dead

Driving by your house, but you don't live here now
It's not even on my way, but I wanted to think on how
It felt to walk this road, all years before

We were hardened to it all
Hardened to it all
All you can never hope to change, because the fight is so unclean
All you defeatists raise your hands, and grease the old machine
Until you're hardened to it all

Like all the grayest little men, remember all they used to be
If this is all we ever have, well it was good enough for me
Come on, defeatists raise your hands, and grease the old machine
Until you're hardened to it all
Til you are hardened to it all
