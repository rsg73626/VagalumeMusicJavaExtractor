ALL I CAN REMEMBER

This is all I can remember after
All I had forgotten, well its you
oh, no.
You can strive for head of empty baby
Try and think of nothing
But think of me, Oh no, no.

Well this is all I can remember after
all I had forgotten, Well its you
oh no.
You can strive for head of empty baby
Try and think of nothing,
Think of me oh, oh.
You're alright, alright tonight
