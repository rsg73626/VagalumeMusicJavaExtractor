WHEN YOU COME BACK I WON'T BE HERE

Don't tell me love is worth the waiting,
You kept me hanging all these years,
But it's so good to feel this patience running out,
When you come back I won't be here.

So why you hanging onto misery?
Don't you see there's nothing left to fear,
Cos if you're chewing something ugly, just spit it out,
When you come back I won't be here.

Dear leader I am but a nothingness,
But you're good at looking all sincere,
But you've been getting everything you want for long enough,
When you come back I won't be here.

There are no prizes here for tolerance,
We cannot all be insignificant,
And if they still don't understand I'll just spell it out,
When you come back I won't be here.

Dear leader I am but nothingness,
One little brick in your career,
And if by any chance you hear me, well listen up,
When you come back I won't be here, No.
When you come back I won't be here, No.
When you come back I won't be here.
