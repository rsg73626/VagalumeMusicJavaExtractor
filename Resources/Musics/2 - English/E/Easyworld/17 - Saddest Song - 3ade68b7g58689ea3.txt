SADDEST SONG

Wont you look out to that horizon
These ships will all sail away
They all disappear like promises, it would all be so different
Oh but there’s a day before the darkness

For drawing the bigger pictures
For drawing the friendly fire
For drawing upon a lifetime of ugly experience
Don’t you leave me at the last time of asking

There is nothing serious, enough for this for this, for this
There is nothing serious, enough for this.

It’s easy to count your blessing
It’s easy to soldier on
It’s easy to make the best of a bad situation
It’s easy for me to smile and say hold on

There’s nothing serious, enough for this, for this
There’s nothing serious, enough to lose tomorrow

A wish for a choir of angels
A wish for a second chance
A wish for an opportunity to have said something simple like don’t leave
Or to catch you at the last time of asking

There’s nothing serious, enough for this for this, for this
There is nothing serious, enough to lose tomorrow, lose tomorrow, oh to lose tomorrow
