BLEACH

So you're sad
And you're right
Kill yourself
If you like

Cos it sucks
So do I
See your day
Crawling by

And you know
When you're just
Hanging on
That's enough

And if it helps
Carry on
Be content
You don't belong

Oh I know...

You make me want to drink bleach
You make me want to bite stars
Though you're losing yourself
Still I know who you are

It's a beautiful pain
As the sun in my eyes
And I want to drink bleach
To let me feel I'm alive

I'm so sorry
Little one
You know I said
I'd protect you from

The evil world
That you despise
Cos it sucks
So do I

And you know
When you're just
Hanging on
That's enough

And if it helps
Carry on
Be content
You don't belong

So how does it feel
To choke on happy
Drown in joy

Choke on happy
Drown in...
Oh and I want to drink bleach
