YOU AND ME

Now feel it good and dirty
I'm gonna hurt somebody
I hope you're feeling thirsty sweet thing
Cos I'm courting controversy

I know you look like you're innocent baby
I know you tell all your friends that you hate me
But every weekend you're at it like crazy
You and me

So come around and see me
I mix a mean martini
And maybe later beat me senseless
And after dinner eat me

I know you look like you're innocent baby
I know you tell all your friends that you hate me
But every weekend you're at it like crazy
You and me (yeh)

(x2)

Repeats a third time as main vocalist sings:

I know you look, you look, you look like you're innocent baby
I know you tell all your friends that you hate me
Yeeeeeeeh!
Yeeeeeeehhhhhhow!!
