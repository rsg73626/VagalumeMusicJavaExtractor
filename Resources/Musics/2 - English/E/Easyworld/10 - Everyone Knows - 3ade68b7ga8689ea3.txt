EVERYONE KNOWS

Yeah yeah yeah
Its some fine revolution
And there's nobody can keep you down
I've paid to you bitch now love me, yeah
Coz that's the way it is now

Hey hey hey
Do you know where your kids are and kids,
D'ya know what the grown-ups do?
Coz they all smoke crack
In the teachers lounge
And then they beg you not to

Everyone knows that it's all right
There's nothing else on TV tonight

Well happiness is some cubic zirconia
And one day, son, it could all be yours
Just pin your hopes on industrial illness
And settle out of court

Hey hey hey
Do you know where your kids are and kids,
D'ya know what the grown-ups do?
Coz they all smoke crack
In the teachers lounge
And then they beg you not to

Everyone knows that it's all rise
There's nothing else on TV tonight x 3
