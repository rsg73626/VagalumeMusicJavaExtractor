A STAIN TO NEVER FADES

You'll always be to me
A stain to never fade
The worst mistake I've made

A blemish on an otherwise detestable career
A studied insincere

But I'll always be to you
A record overplayed
The rain on your parade

Will you never look at me
And see beautiful again
I would I were the same

But I look for always...

I don't want to understand
To make it go away
Or hush myself when I just want to say
Will you never be to me
A surface kind of friend
I do believe that this is not the end

It's not the end

I'll always be to you
A stain to never fade
The worst mistake you've made

An episode to file under "never try again"
I would I were the same

But I want to be your adrenaline
The redness across your chest
Oh lover I confess

Though you'll always be to me
A stain to never fade
I'd do it all again

Because I look for always...

And still I stand with the persistence of an idiot
Still I stand will I say...

Hell, I do believe that this is not the end
