TRY NOT TO THINK

He likes to keep his brain on the more mundane 
'Cos some things, they just are, you know 
Things are falling into place the thinking of the chase 
The picturing her face upon the body of a silicon based porn-star 

I dont know why but i just love everything about you 
I 'm gonna try not to think; if i think, i could doubt you 

Star-cross'd lovers take their lives every friday nite 
He's swearing by the moon again 
And she, she tells invented dreams and she finds it hard to breathe 
Yeah she writes his name in steam upon the shower screen with her left hand ... oooh 

I dont know why but i just love everything about you 
I'm gonna try not to think; if i think, i could doubt you 

Little me, little unromantic me 
Honestly, sincerely unromantic me little me! 

I dont know why but i just love everything about you 
I'm gonna try not to think; if i think, i could doubt you
