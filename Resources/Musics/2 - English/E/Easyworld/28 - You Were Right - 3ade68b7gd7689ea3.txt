YOU WERE RIGHT

Time it came, It went, It's gone
All this time to sit and think of
All the things I never did for you

And my mistakes, they've taught me well
What am I learning, Cos if you give me
One more chance I'll only let you down

And you're less fucked up than the average girl
You are ... But then you always were
All I know is wrong, but you were right all along
All I know is wrong, but you were right all along

Little late now don't you think
To come over all self defensive
I'll take no blame in anything at all

And I don't really care to be
Picking through this wreckage
Just to see the point which it all went wrong

And you're less fucked up than the average girl
You are ... But then you always were

Yeah the time is a rap for being wrong
For being wrong

Here's a couple of points you missed
From your comprehensive list
Of things I never did for you

All I know is wrong, but you were right all along ....
