TONIGHT

Forget me if you can
This I understand too well
A fail to make you mine
Heart attack and lime taste good
A thousand broken hearts
Littering your path through here
Tell me that you lied
Say you never think of me

But tonight before you sleep
There will be a you and me
And I hope I'm on your mind
When you wake. Oh

Its worn away in time
The fingerprints on mine still show
This chance as good as blown
Don't want to be alone, tonight

A thousand broken hearts
Littering your path through here
Oh its so beautiful and sad
Need for nothing but I want you bad

But tonight before you sleep
There will be a you and me
And I hope I'm on your mind when you wake, oh

When you wake, oh anything at all
Will you say the word oh will you give me anything at all tonight

The sun will burn the sea
You'll waste yourself on me, tonight.

And tonight before you sleep
There will be a you and me
And I hope I'm on your mind
When you wake.
