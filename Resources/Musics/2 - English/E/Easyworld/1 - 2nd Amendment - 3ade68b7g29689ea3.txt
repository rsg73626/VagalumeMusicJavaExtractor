2ND AMENDMENT

So you want to live forever
Give your stirring speeches on TV
We can laugh about it later, can't we

All your heroes went down fighting
So you get in every fight you can
and it makes you feel much closer to the man

I get my killing in the free world ain't it fun
Its good for everyone
For better television
Does anybody want it? Come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun

Brother can you smell the envy
Everybody wants to be like you
And the ones who don't well fuck 'em and you do

I get my killing in the free world ain't it fun
Its good for everyone
For better television
Does anybody want it? come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun

Oh inshallah
Does anybody wanna get off
Oh ooh inshallah
And the cars will run forever
Its good for everyone
For better television
Does anybody want it come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun
