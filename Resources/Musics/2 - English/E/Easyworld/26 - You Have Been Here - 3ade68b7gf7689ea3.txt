YOU HAVE BEEN HERE

Baby don’t cry for me 
Been here for a while 
And I believe it’s alright to be 
Through the screen with a smile 
This business of killing me 
Will be here when I’m gone 

When I’m gone 
So long 
You have been here 
When I’m gone 
So long 
You have been here 

Don’t try and explain to me 
How the truth wore you down 
And how the insecure strain to be 
In the best seats in town 
For a future so grey to me 
Guess I won’t see you there 

Do they know 
Don’t you know 
That you have been here 
Don’t you know 
Don’t you know 
That you have been here 

And I’m gone 
So long 
You have been here
