GOODNIGHT

Goodnight my friends
I’m glad you’ve come around
You’ve been so down
Oh the joy of seeing you smile so wide
I don’t need anything

These broken shoes
Have done some walking and
Though all these holes
We touch the ground and it feels like home
I don't need anything

Don’t look and you wont find
It’s always worth your time
I love you and goodnight
Goodnight

I said this hurt
It wont last forever and
This time I’m right
As you turn to me and you smile so wide
I don't need anything

This lucky day
Its been a long time coming and
All that we’ve done
It wont be forgotten. Goodnight
Goodnight

Don’t look and you wont find
It’s always worth your time
I love you and goodnight
Goodnight

(instrumental)

Play back this tape I swear you'll see
I only wanted you to be with me
Oh, Kill The Last Romantic
And come back for me
