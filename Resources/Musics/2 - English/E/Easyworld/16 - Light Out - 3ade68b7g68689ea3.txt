LIGHT OUT

After all is said and nothing's done
Where are we then?
All comes crashing round your feet
And does that change a thing?

You said it's the best day of your life
Well, that's so damn true

Now the lights are all out
And the systems are down
For once in my life
I think we're getting somewhere...

Somewhere near the end of everything
What do you care?
As one by one the lights go out and
Sun comes up again

You said it's the best day of your life
Well, that's so damn true
