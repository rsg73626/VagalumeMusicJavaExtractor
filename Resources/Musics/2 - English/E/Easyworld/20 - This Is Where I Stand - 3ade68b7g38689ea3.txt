THIS IS WHERE I STAND

The ache of a thousand nearly nothings
Like unrequited love
It doesn't mean a single fucking thing

The ground has shifted crazy
This is where I stand
Here I'll stay, still feels the same

There's no such thing as guarantee
And what I'd give, for just
One moment's clarity
I can trust not to disappear

It's all I've ever wanted
It's what I tell myself
Call it faith and
Think of something else

There's no such thing as guarantee
Or control when it feels the same

I woke up somewhere stupid god what have I done?
Not a thing no single fucking thing
The ground has shifted crazy
This is where I stand
Here I'll stay, still feels the same

There's no such thing as guarantee
Or control when it feels the same
