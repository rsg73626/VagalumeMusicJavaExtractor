YOU MAKE ME WANT TO DRINK BLEACH

so you're sad 
and you're right 
kill yourself 
if you like 

cause it sucks 
so do i 
see your day 
crawling by 

and you know 
when you're just 
hanging on 
that's enough 

and if it helps 
carry on 
be content 
you don't belong 

oh i know... 

you make me want to drink bleach 
you make me want to bite stars 
though you're losing yourself 
still i know who you are 

it's a beautiful pain 
as the sun in my eyes 
and i want to drink bleach 
to let me feel i'm alive 

i'm so sorry 
little one 
you know i said 
i'd protect you from 

the evil world 
that you despise 
cause it sucks 
so do i 

and you know 
when you're just 
hanging on 
that's enough 

and if it helps 
carry on 
be content 
you don't belong 

so how does it feel 
to choke on happy 
drown in joy 

choke on happy 
drown in... 
oh and i want to drink bleach
