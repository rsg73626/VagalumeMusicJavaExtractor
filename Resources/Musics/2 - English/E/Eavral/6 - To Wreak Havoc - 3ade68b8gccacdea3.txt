TO WREAK HAVOC

The canonical order of the present eternity 
Extensive way of spreading false ideology 
The time is ripe to strike their so-called unity 
And force a way to wreak havoc and breed anarchy 

The religions, enduring with the misguided masses 
Shall be swept from the face of this earth 
The choice was theirs: our way or total removal 
They did their pick and chose 
the path with the dead end 

Justice will not be defined on the basis of the bible 
Right or wrong will be judged by our own behavior 
Why only we seem to realize the current system's feeble? 
Any sane man sees that there never was any savior 

Today they are the leaders 
Tomorrow we'll take their place 
We, the non-believers 

The only way to maintain order is by agony 
No church or state, just one supreme tyranny
