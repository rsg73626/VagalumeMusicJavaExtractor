OF SHADOWS AND THE DYING SUN

Peaceful it was in the beginning 
Everything existed for itself 
No sovereignty nor god 
Except for the inherent. 

At some point there was a turn 
A sudden change in the continuum 
Religion entered the fields 
Shattering the solidity of mankind 

It all was nothing 
Like nothing through our hearts 
Sweeping the spectre 
Of shadows and the dying sun 

Two thousand years have passed 
Living in the shades of faith 
Now it's time for retribution 
By our supressed hate 
To betoken the raping cyclone 
And the cleansing doom 
The final accomplishment 
To restore what once abloom 

Thus the space lingered on 
The distance seemed to be endless 
Then from nothing came the answer 
The solution which had been sought for ages 

It was then when it all seemed so worthwhile 
The preceeding epoch was not in vain 
But the lies were fresh in their minds 
In the eyes of the society we were still the ones they resent
