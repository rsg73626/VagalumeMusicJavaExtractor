THE HERITAGE

Dark...are these times 
They...are dying 

But we will remain 
For we are not the sheep 
We are the ones 
Chosen by ourselves 
To carry on the heritage 
Of what was not meant to last 

The future is for us to create 
And maintain. 

The religious cattle willingly chose the way of 
Slow and inconspicuous corruption. 
After all 
their existence on this earth was brief. 

Hardly visible, the sun cast it's last cold rays. 
If this is not the end 
Then what is?
