BLACK MOON

Dawn of justice
The end of light
Fall of the christian
Holy unite
You're not pure,
But we are the cure
Off their knees the christian flee

As their thrones made of lies
They fall into a downward suicide
Thus they'll see the thruth behind
The wisdom of an infernal mind

Black moon rising upon you fucking slaves
(we'll laugh at you when your maker breaks)
Heavenly empire will feel our wrath
Thou shalt suffer, we'll make it last

Now that the land is ours again
We feast on your corpses 'til the very end
