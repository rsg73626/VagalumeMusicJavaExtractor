THE ESSENCE OF PURITY

In the depths of those evergreen forests 
Many times have I wandered 
But still my soul yearns for more 
For in the caress of the nature 
The true essence of purity can be found 

They are so delightfully silent 
The untouched woods so pure 
Where the the disease has not yet been spread 
I can find my only true haven
