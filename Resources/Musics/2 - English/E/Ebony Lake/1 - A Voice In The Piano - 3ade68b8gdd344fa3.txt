A VOICE IN THE PIANO

As you drown, I fought oceans in vain; 
it's cold now under the moon.
It's hard to breathe... breathe.

Her screaming I hear from deepest seas, 
her voice I hear in the piano.

Amid the cold roof of the charnel house, 
arisen from the sweet sick burning scent; 
I'm torn, lovelorn, lonely, dying.

Her screaming I hear from deepest seas, 
her voice I hear in the piano.

The quill it dances painting the paper, 
and I play not the music but a woman's soft voice, 
a ghostly message from the girl I'd die for.

Excuse me Mother, but I must join her now.
