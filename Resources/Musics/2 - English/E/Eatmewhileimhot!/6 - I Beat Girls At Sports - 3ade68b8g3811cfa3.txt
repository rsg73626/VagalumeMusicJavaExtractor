I BEAT GIRLS AT SPORTS

Get out the house is on fire
Your selfishness lit the fire while your eyes were dead in stare
Your name is on the air, calm me down.
Even if youve never wanted to love
Then burn the person down
Ill bring the ashes in, scream the words out
Even if youve never wanted to die
(Do you believe me now?)
Just close yours eyes, I'll let you down slow

But not for water
Is where Im afraid?
Shes waiting, for anything
Shes waiting, but not for me
There is no water. Thats where Im afraid
Shes waiting, for anything
Shes waiting, but not for me
There is no water, is where she sleeps
