ANTI-VENOM

I am the anti venom.

(unknown)
Everybody broken promise that I ever fucking made
Is adding to the complex that is driving me insane.
(unknown)
No one can ever know where I've been
Everybody broken promise that you ever fucking made
Is adding to the complex that is driving you insane.

I am the anti venom running through your veins,
I am the one who loved you when you went insane
I am the one who told you not to be afraid
I am the one who told you not to be ashamed

Someone's out to get me
Someone's out to get me
Everybody broken promise that I ever fucking made
Is adding to the complex that is driving me insane.
(unknown)
Everybody broken promise that you ever fucking made
Is adding to the complex that is driving you insane.
