WHEN IN ROME

When in Rome, do as the romans do.
You have a knack for bringing out the worst in me.
And I haven't felt this way before.
Take your time.

Live your life.
Say goodnight.
Then shove it down my throat.
You were the first one to replace 

All of the things we said we'd never give away.
You move on and on and on and on and on.
Leave all of your friends.
Live all of your lies.

I don't see how did i put up with your shit for so long.
OH!
You're the one who told me that i gotta big heart.
Gotta use my head just a little bit more.

Gotta little bit more on my shoulders than you think.
We are so close, we are so close.
Fuck this.
For sure, I'll never take you back.
