THE TWO ARMED MAN

You were the fire in my eyes but I wanted to burn you out
With a hit and a miss you know what I'm all about
(Woah, woah, woahhh, ohhh)

Staring you down
I see the fear in your eyes
I ain't scared of your fists
Or your mother-freakin lies
Burn it down (eyyuh)

You're not trying, I swear I'm trying
Please stop trying my hand
Who are you kidding?

I know it's hard to say 
But it's the truth
Cause everything you throw my way is the same
Cause all I do 
Is waste my time with you
When all is said and done
Will I be the one who's left alone again? (oohhh)
Now I'm stuck here wasting, wasting away

(I, oh, let's go!)

Everybody says that you're on top of the world
But I know the truth.
You're a sick sad son of a gun and your right hand's a one-way ticket to hell
Ready? Go

I was a friend of you
You were a friend of mine
But I battle on
Yah, trick
