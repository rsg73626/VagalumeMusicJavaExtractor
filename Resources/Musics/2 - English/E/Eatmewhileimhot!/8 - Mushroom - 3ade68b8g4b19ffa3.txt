MUSHROOM

Hey, Hey, Hey,

I'm boarding up my room,
I'm hanging up my noose,
I'm cutting back
I'm gonna die real soon,

I'm shooting up in puny now,
Just like a mushroom, a mushroom,
I'm shooting up in chemical swirls,
Just like a mushroom, a mushroom,

I'm flying to the moon,
The world is all but doomed,
Its save to say your screwed,
You're gonna die real soon,

I'm shooting up and puny now,
Just like a mushroom, a mushroom,
I'm shooting up in chemical swirls,
Just like a mushroom, a mushroom,

I'm shooting up and puny now,
Just like a mushroom, a mushroom,
I'm shooting up in chemical swirls,
Just like a mushroom, a mushroom.
