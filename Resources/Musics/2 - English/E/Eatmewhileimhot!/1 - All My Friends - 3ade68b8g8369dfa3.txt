ALL MY FRIENDS

You are sober
Acting drunk
Many closer
Your out of luck

I don't know what your thinking
Acting without reason

This is my town
This is my pride
These are my friends
This is my life
You are so out of luck

Tell me what your gonna do
Tonight
When my friends
Are calling you out all night

Tell me what your gonna do
If I
Catch you spotin another lie

I don't want to talk about it
Anymore
I give you my reasons
Now im showing you the door

This is my town
This is my pride
These are my friends
This is my life
You are so out of luck

Tell me what your gonna do
Tonight
When my friends
Are calling you out all night

Tell me what your gonna do
If I
Aatch you spotin another lie

Oh! I know
All my friends got my back
