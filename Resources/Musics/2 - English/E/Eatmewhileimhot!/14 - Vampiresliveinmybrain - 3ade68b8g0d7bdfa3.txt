Soon you'll be believing
I'll be feeding on your blood
My love, my love, my

Oh!
I don't wanna go where the sun lives
Hurts my eyes and burns my skin
Anytime i go outside it feel like sin

I want to suck your blood

I'm a vampire
Can't you see
I live off blood
And beautiful women

Oh!
I don't wanna go where the sun lives
Hurts my eyes and burns my skin
Anytime i go outside it hurts like sin
Oh!
I don't wanna go where the sun lives
Hurts my eyes and burns my skin
Anytime i thirst for blood it feels like sin

I want to suck your blood

I'm a vampire
Can't you see
I live off blood
And beautiful women

I will never die
Never die
No never die
I will never die
Will never die

I will never die
Never die, never die
Never

I will never die, never die
Never
I will never die
Never die, never die
I will never die
Never die
Never.
