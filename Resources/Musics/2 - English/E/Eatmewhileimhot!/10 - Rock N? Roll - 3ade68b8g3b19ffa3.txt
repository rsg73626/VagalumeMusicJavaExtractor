ROCK N? ROLL

Hey every single time I look into your eyes
I get a certain little feeling that I despise
It's like I wanna tell you I love you but I don't know how
It's like a fire in my chest just dying to get out (x2)

Rock n' Roll'. Rock rock rock rock rock rock n? roll (x2)

Hey yeahhh Rock n' Roll he ain't got shit on us

Elvis ain't dead he's in my basement doing my daily chores
I don't know why.. every single time I look into your eyes
I get a certain little feeling that I despise

Rock n' Roll'. Rock rock rock rock rock rock n' roll (x2)

(Screams and laughs x3)
