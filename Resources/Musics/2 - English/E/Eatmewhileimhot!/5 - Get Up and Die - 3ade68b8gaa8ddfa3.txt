GET UP AND DIE

You are a couch potato
And you know what we do with couch potatoes
We make them get up and die
(die,die,die)
Get off your sorry behind
And do something with your pathetic life
You have become a parasite

Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die

Now that you have woken from your slumber
What do you have to say to yourslef?
Doesn't you feel cool?
(cool,cool,cool)

Getting up off your sorry behind
And doing something with your life
Is somthing everyone should do
(do,do,do)

Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
Get up and die
