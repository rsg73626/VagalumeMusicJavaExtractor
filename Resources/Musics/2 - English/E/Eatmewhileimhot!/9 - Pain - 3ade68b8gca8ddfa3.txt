PAIN

I've got a message to the universe
I've got a message to the world
I've got a message for every boy and girl

The colors of the rainbow
Fading out your face
Change

Willows blooming from the ground
Top soiled by our pain
Willows blooming from the ground
Top soiled by our pain

Pain, pain, ohhohhh pain
Come get ya some pain
WooOhhh pain, yeah, pain
Come get ya some, come get ya some pain
