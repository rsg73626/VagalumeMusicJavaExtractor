COUGHKIDCOUGH

I will not let your life gain.
You're running in circles
like the tie you're in.

Where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?
I will tie my hands.
This is your life.
This is your time.

Just run away from me.
Just wipe it off on me. ??
I was sent to pick a boy like you ??

No lie ??
No lie ??
What I know
What I know
What I know
