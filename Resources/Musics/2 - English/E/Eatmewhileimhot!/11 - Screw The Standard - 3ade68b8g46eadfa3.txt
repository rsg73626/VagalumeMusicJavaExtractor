SCREW THE STANDARD

Radios blarin' and my hearts on fire
Put a bullet through my head and then we'll call it a night.
Whoaa uh oh oh uh oh. Whoaa uh oh oh uh ohhhh.
Stereos singin' and i'm out of luck,

Another cigarette and i'll say i've enough.
And whoaa uh oh oh uh oh. Whoaa uh oh oh uh ohhhh
Burnin' down while i'll be your favorite lie,
Packing all my things, i'm leavin' you behind.

(i've got my keys!) i've got my keys!
(forget the load!) forget the load!
(i've got my friends), i've got my friends.
(we'll hit the road!) we'll hit the road
Riding on the back in the fear of the standards

The standards that now we will reign,
And i'll i've gotta say is that i'm sick of this town and lets screw the standards and lets make a stand!
Burnin' down while i'll be your favorite lie,
Packing all my things, i'm leavin' you behind.

(i've got my keys!) i've got my keys!
(forget the load!) forget the load!
(i've got my friends), i've got my friends.
(we'll hit the road!) we'll hit the road

And all i'll i know, all i know
Is that i'm never lookin' back, never lookin' back again.. Ohh again.
I thought i told ya... I thought i told ya!
Screaming: all i got!
