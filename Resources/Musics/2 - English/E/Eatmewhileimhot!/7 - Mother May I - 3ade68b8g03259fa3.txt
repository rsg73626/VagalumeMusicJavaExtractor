Is it not enough to just have me
Whoa

He's standing alone with the gun in his hand
Why am I the man?, Why am I the man?
Brother of mine take this away
I'm sick of this life of pain

(Oooh)

Is it just enough for you to breathe, I'm begging
Is it not enough to just have me
Whoa
Is it just enough for you to be, I'm trying

He's dead on the floor with his gun in his hand
Why was he the man?, Why was he the man?

Is it not enough to just have me
Whoa
Is it just enough for you to be, I'm trying
And where I go you will follow
