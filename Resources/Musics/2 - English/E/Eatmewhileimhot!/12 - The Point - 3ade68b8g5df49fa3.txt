THE POINT

You can do whatever you want your not stuck with me
I'll tell you one thing we'd make history you
You and me

Your getting closer now
It's getting better now
But your still so far gone

And I'm to
The point where I don't even wanna know 
Where you are or where your going baby 
(ooo)

Same old story
I'm to 
The point where I dont even wanna see
Your face anymore, anymore

I don't wanna live with regret
Wich is why my life is a mess 
When all you want is more
More, more, more

Your getting closer now, 
Still getting better now
But your still
But your still so
Far gone

And I'm to
The point where I don't even wanna know 
Where you are or where your going baby 
(ooo)

Same old story
I'm to 
The point where I dont even wanna see
Your face anymore, anymore

Your so far gone
But I'm moving on

I, I never
Never felt so alive without
Without you by my side
I never,
I never felt so alive
I'm so glad I left you behind

(screaming)
