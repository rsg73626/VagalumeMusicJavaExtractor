(I USED TO COULDN'T DANCE) TIGHT PANTS

I used to couldn't dance too good
I had to get some moves
I was a-scared of the dance floor
I had the no boogie blues
Now I'm on fire
Show these ladies my can do
And I'll show you, too
It used to be a massacre
I never got a second glance
Now I'm kinda lethal on the dance floor
Check it, tight pants!
Move in and get tighter
Now you show me you can do, too
I don't want to do what I'm supposed to
(Never, never, never)
I just want someone to get close to 
(Come a little closer)
There ain't no certain way to move
Now don't you tell me how 
I'm supposed to dance
There ain't no parking on this dance floor
Now step aside, check it, tight pants!
Be my rider
Let's show them what we can do
