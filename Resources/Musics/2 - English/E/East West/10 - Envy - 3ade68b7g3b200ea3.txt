ENVY

I watched you fade away,
into a sea of taillights.
My eyes still strained to this day...
Evidence of who we were,
left here along the way.
I see the truth in the tree.

Iâ€™ll free you, fall away.
Iâ€™ll free you, fade away. (x 2)

The world just stopped its pull,
and I could almost hear you,
crying out through the noise...
The things I thought I knew,
so close to understanding.
But now Iâ€™m dumb to the wise.

Iâ€™ll free you, fall away.
Iâ€™ll free you, fade away. (x 2)

I see her, perfectly clothed in white...my eyes burn...

Iâ€™ll free you, fall away.
