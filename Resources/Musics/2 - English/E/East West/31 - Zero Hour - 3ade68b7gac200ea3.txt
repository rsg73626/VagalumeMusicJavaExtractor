ZERO HOUR

Walking against the wind,
pushing the endless road,
where will we lay our heads?
Soothing to kiss her lips.
Itâ€™s where we long to be,
Chaos and comfort are near.

Weâ€™ll run together,
Facing the night.

Gripping the morning star,

Breathing a long relief,
watching the houses fade.
So now the lines are drawn,
and see the blood run cold,
what if the world stops spinning?

Donâ€™t walk away.
Nothing to say, just stay here with me,
weâ€™ll look back and laugh someday.
Donâ€™t run away,
Lifeâ€™s got its ways, of bringing you 
down, kicking you in the teeth.

So give it all some time,
at least we have each other.
I know weâ€™ll dream.

Donâ€™t walk away.
Nothing to say, just stay here with me,
weâ€™ll look back and laugh someday.
Donâ€™t run away,
Lifeâ€™s got its ways, of bringing you 
down, kicking you in the teeth.

So give it all some time,
at least we have each other.
