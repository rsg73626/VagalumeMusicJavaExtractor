PHAT

You walk into your beautiful house
You stuff a steak in your beautiful mouth
You drive around in your big beautiful car
You blow your money on your beautiful hair
You think you're better cause you got more than me
You lose it all then who would you be
You're just a punk in a Mercedes Benz
You drive around to impress your friends
Taking me for a ride,
Your bellies phat and you're ready for slaughter
You're bowing down to the all mighty dollar
