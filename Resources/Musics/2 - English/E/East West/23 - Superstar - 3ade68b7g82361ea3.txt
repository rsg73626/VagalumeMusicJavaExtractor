SUPERSTAR

I just got to know,
What it is you see.
Is it something different?
Is it something sacred?
Throw away the outside,
Take away the fear,
I'll just wait here quietly.
Yet know matter,

What they do, never let them take what you have,
What they say, never going change who you are.

Try to hide pain
Smiling on the outside,
Fighting desperation.
Is it something Deadly?
Anybody listing?
Anybody hear?
Show the world your brokenness.

Faceless words, rush like wind
Guard my broken thoughts to heal,
Emotionless, to fields I fly,
