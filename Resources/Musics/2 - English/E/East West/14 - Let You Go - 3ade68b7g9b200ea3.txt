LET YOU GO

Standing waiting for this moment to end,
I can't believe it's finally here.
We said that kiss would be a promise forever 
and I can't believe you're going away.
Got to let you go,
Just like we always said.
Got to let you go,
Just like we said before.
My mind is filled with these memories of you,
Your smile deep inside my tears,
I wonder if there are roses in heaven,
and I wish that I could hold you right here.
And when I start to dream,
It's your face, that I see,
And when I breathe?Through the years,
We shared the tears,
That freed us from the yesteryears,
We made the sacrifice of time,
But never feeling left behind,
Standing in the pouring rain,
I promise I won't cry again,
