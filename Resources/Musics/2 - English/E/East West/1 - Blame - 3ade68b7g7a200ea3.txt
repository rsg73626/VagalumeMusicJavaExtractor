BLAME

Won't you come with me
To a place I like to hide
To a place where I can slumber
against the fall of this world
Who you gonna blame
Everywhere I go
Gotta find someone to give the abuse
Gotta pass off the blame, you gotta blame it on me
Now I see your shame
the shadows comfort you
your guilt stricken face it tells me
that you've been, just where I've been
