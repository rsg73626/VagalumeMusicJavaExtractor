MURDERER

Waiting in a corner standing.
Playing out the best case.
Your pleasure is nearing.

Hunt them.
Get away.
Hurt them.

In a moment madness reeling.
Thereâ€™s no one watching now,
the innocence dying.

Hunt them.
Get away.
Hurt them.

Nothing Breathes inside...
Nothing Lives inside...

Sickening cries call out.
Begging to be released,
only to find,
theyâ€™re falling on deaf ears.

Hunt them.
Get away.
Hurt them.

Nothing Breathes inside...
