DED

One more life is swayed,
To gain your so called freedom,
You lie, you cheat, you steal,
And yet you still don't see.
Overturn the will of the people,
While we just stand by idle,
Yeah, that's right I'm pointing fingers,
You wait and see.
How's this is this what you wanted?
Open up your eyes,
And face what is to come.
These lies they're gaining ground,
And we're just buying' time
We stand our backs are braced
Our feet are firmly planted
Come quickly God we cry
Come quickly, come quickly.
I see your face, your hand so close, your voice so clear.
