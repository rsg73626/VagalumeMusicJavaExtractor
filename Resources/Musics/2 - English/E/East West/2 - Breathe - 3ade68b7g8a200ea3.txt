BREATHE

Breathe on me,
Just another punk coming straight out of O.C.,
Yeah you don't know me but I sure aint no croney
Bringin a style that's fresh and new,
Giving all the praise to the one that's true.
If you got ears to hear, you better open them,
Bringing the faith, and the love, and the hope to them.
All. All around the world as we cry?Oh wont you breathe on me?Breathe on me,
Justified and we're free you know we hit straight,
Aint no reason to lie, it's all about a clean slate,
But still we see times that are hard,
Sticking to lines that are faded and scared.
So we press on never turning around, no need to 
look back when there's nothing but ground. As we
Wait for you to bring us alive.
