HEY JUNE

Hey June, I can't believe
you going away again this far.
Hey June I can't take much more of this at all
Cause life was meant to be so much more than you are...
Hey June, I didn't hear you come in late again last night
Hey June, I can't smell his cologne on you
Hey June, Are you gonna stay out late again tonight
Cause life was meant to be so much more than you are...
