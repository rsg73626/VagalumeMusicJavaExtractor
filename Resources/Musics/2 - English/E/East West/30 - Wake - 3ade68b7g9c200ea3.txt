WAKE

And now I see the end,
And everything is gone,
As I begin to move,
and I begin to see.
And all I want to do,
Is be in here with you,
And all I want from you,
is to see your face.
You will wake me.
And now I see this life,
As it begins to shine,
And I begin to see,
Just what's inside of me.
Now I wait here broken,
Waiting to see you,
Eyes wide open.
