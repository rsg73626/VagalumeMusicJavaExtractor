BRUTALLY WRONG

Kicked and stabbed along the way,
planning for the hour.
Revenge a method, one of many
to consummate the change.

Why, what could you ever gain?
Nothing it seems except being lame.
What, what could you ever lose?
Brutally wrong, itâ€™s all a game.

Moving forward, leaving something
requires the unsaid.
Be a man and let it all go,
abandoning your pride.

Why, what could you ever gain?
Nothing it seems except being lame.
What, what could you ever lose?
Brutally wrong, itâ€™s all a game. (x 2)

Now itâ€™s here,
time to choose.
You decide
what youâ€™ll become.

Why, what could you ever gain?
Nothing it seems except being lame.
What, what could you ever lose?
