THE FINAL SAY

Gather around to hear the future.
Wonder what or who it will be.
Rumors fly of the possibilities,
everyone is taking a chance.

And I know, when everythingâ€™s said and done,
in the end, nothing they say will matter anyway.

Weâ€™ll always be just who we are.
Weâ€™ll be okay no matter where we land.

Time to take the stage.
Turn my eyes up towards the sky.
The room is very dark,
but somehow thereâ€™s light in here.

And I know, when everythingâ€™s said and done,
in the end, nothing they say will matter anyway.

Weâ€™ll always be just who we are.
Weâ€™ll be okay no matter where we land. (x 2)

So here we are.
Better put on The happy face,
Open up the curtains,
Show the final word what they want,
what they want...

Weâ€™ll always be just who we are.
