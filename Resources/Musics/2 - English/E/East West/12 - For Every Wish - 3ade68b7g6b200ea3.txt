FOR EVERY WISH

Watching from the shadows,
stealing all thatâ€™s left.
Great deceiver,
(so) beautiful.
Fading moments,
passing like years.
Wish everything
was perfect.

Iâ€™m all Iâ€™ll ever need,
so go away.
Keep your lies.
For every wish,
thereâ€™s hope and time.

Now itâ€™s complicated,
I wish I was medicated.
Thereâ€™s gotta be some way out of here.
Looking for release
to end the greatest need.

Iâ€™m all Iâ€™ll ever need,
so go away.
Keep your lies.
For every wish
thereâ€™s hope and time. (x 2)

GOD HELP ME!!
GOD HELP ME!!

Gotta peel away the skin,
just find The Truth in here. (x 2)

Iâ€™m all Iâ€™ll ever need,
so go away.
Keep your lies.
For every wish,
thereâ€™s hope and time. (x 2)
