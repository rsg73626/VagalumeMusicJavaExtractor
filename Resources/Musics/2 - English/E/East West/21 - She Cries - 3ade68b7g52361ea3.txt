SHE CRIES

Won't you come away with me tonight?
We can fly past the moon and the starlight,
It doesn't matter where you've been before,
On a night like this,
It doesn't matter where you've been before,
I'll love you like this she cry,
Can't you see, I won't leave,
But you have to open your eyes.
Here I stand, Take my hand,
Let go of the fear that you hold.
Don't throw your pearls to the swine tonight,
Don't let them take your innocence,
Just remember the times that I held your hand and kept you close,
