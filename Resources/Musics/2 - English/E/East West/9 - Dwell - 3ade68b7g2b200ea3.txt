DWELL

Head hurts
back here again, I
painted the walls,
the cracks remain, and 
I fear,
to close my eyes,
become accustomed, 
so dig in.
Every time,
I breathe this air,
the sick stench,
never seems to go away.

You fail,
You break,
You freak,
You falter,
You lie,
You kill,
You burn,
Youâ€™re nothing...(x 2)
to me...

I breathe this air,
the sick stench,
it never seems to go away,
...go away . . .

You fail,
You break,
You freak,
You falter,
You lie,
You kill,
You burn,
Youâ€™re nothing...(x 2)

I feel it changing,
the air...clean...
itâ€™s you...

You fail,
You break,
You freak,
You falter,
You lie,
You kill,
You burn,
