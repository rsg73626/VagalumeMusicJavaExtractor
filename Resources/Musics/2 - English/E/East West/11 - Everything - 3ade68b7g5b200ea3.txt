EVERYTHING

Here I m, a broken man
down on my face, once again
and I have seen this place so many times before
so you won't pick me up and turn me right side out.
And when I turn my eyes on you, your my everything
Here I am a jaded man, stand on my own
once again so won't you take my life and everything I am
cause I can't stay here oh no here I go again
Here I am a broken man
down on my face once again.
Now I feel the fire burning inside
I can see your hands molding me right
