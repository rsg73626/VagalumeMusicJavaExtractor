NEPHESH

Escaping,
Your breath cold,
Now strain to hear your voice,
Pushing away your hand,
The weight again it falls away.
You're only going to be what you see,
You're never going to jump up,
You're only going to be what you see,
You're always going to be what you are now.
You're only going to be what you see,
You're never going to jump up,
You're only going to be what you see,
You're never going to become just like him.
Reliving,
This needs real,
Now turn to see your face,
Pushing away your hand,
The weight again it falls away.
Now finally seeing what you've always known was true,
