SYDWINDER

I'm always filling my mind
with all this porno lit, treat the
woman I love like a degenerate, I got to give it up
I'm getting sick of it
Sydwinder, It's on the ground
Sydwinder, It comes unwound
Sydwinder, It's all around
Sydwinder, It's on the ground
I'm always telling my mind
I got to get it right, I'm always
telling my mind i got to get it right
I'm always telling my mind I got to get it right
Their always telling my mind I got to get it right
Their always telling my mind I got to get it right
Their always telling my mind I got to get it right
