THORN OF RAGE

Living like a dog, among
a swine, among a trough
full of slime I want to
puke on all the times
they pissed me off,
don't give a slam
about a thing, they
wanna fight, I'm
gonna cream another
punk because I'm
mean, from all the
pretty things I've seen.
You just kneel down
beside the bench, all you
do is pay your money and
forget the rest, I say forget it
man, I want to know the lord,
I want to take up his cross, I
want to take up his sword It
doesn't matter if you're white
or black, He says we're sacred
so deal with that, And don't
bend the world to fit your
style, just teach it right to
make it worth your while.
Thorn of Rage
Your prayers aren't answered,
you wonder why, It's probably
cause you don't know the guy,
you gotta know who, you're
talking to, cause if you don't
well it's no use, you gotta find
time, to read the word everyday
you say that's absurd, you
gotta love the Lord your God,
