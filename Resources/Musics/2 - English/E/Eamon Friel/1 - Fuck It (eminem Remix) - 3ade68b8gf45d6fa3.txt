FUCK IT (EMINEM REMIX)

Ohhh. Uhhhh No No No 

See, I don't.. know why 
I liked you so much, 
I gave you all of my trust 
I told you.. I loved you.. 
Now that's all down the drain 
You put me through pain 
I wanna let you know how I feel 

.:CHORUS:. 
Fuck what I said.. It don't mean shit now.. 
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out.. 
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack.. 
Fuck you, you hoe.. I don't want you back.. 

They call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound 
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now 
I'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship 
Save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick 
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick 
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face 
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face 
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask 
Kiss my dick, get my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass 
Don't put out, i'll put you out, won't get out, i'll push you out 
Puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out 
Am I too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life 
What you tryin' to be my new wife, what you Mariah, fly through twice... 

But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go 
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo' 
Maybe i'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow 
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'... 

.:CHORUS:. 
Fuck what I said.. It don't mean shit now.. 
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out.. 
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack.. 
Fuck you, you hoe.. I don't want you back.. 

You thought.. you could.. Keep this shit from me.. 
Yeah, you burned bitch.. I heard the story.. 
You played me.. You even gave him head.. 
Now you're asking for me back.. 
You're just another hag.. 
Look elsewhere 'cause you're done with me.. 

.:CHORUS:. 
Fuck what I said.. It don't mean shit now.. 
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out.. 
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack.. 
Fuck you, you hoe.. I don't want you back.. 

You questioned.. Did I care? 
You can ask anyone.. I even said you were my great one.. 
Now it's.. over.. 
But I do admit I'm sad.. 
It hurts real bad.. 
I can't sweat that cos I loved a hoe.. 

.:CHORUS:. 
Fuck what I said.. It don't mean shit now.. 
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out.. 
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack.. 
Fuck you, you hoe.. I don't want you back.. 

oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 
oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 
oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 
oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 

oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 
oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 
oh, oh, uh huh, yeah.. 
oh, oh, uh huh, yeah..
