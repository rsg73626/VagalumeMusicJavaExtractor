HOW COULD YOU BRING HIM HOME

[Verse 1]
I got the first flight out
when I finished up the tour,
because I missed you.
I even flew home a day too soon
all because I couldn't wait to kiss you.
Oh how she will be loved,
was the one thing stuck in my mind,
and how tonight would be
remembered for the rest of your life

[Chorus]
I never thought that I'd do something like that,
When I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack,
Oh No!
How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd lose my temper like that,
Now it's some fucked up situation,
He ain't coming back!
Oh No!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

[Verse 2]
I know you know I missed on every girl
because I thought I really loved you,
And you know that I'd never put anyone
or anything above you,
because I loved you,
And there was that love that made me lose my head
and now its too late!
One day too soon, you'll regret it for the rest of your days!

[Chorus]
I never thought that I'd do something like that,
When I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack,
Oh No!
How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd loose my temper like that,
Now its some fucked up situation,
He ain't coming back!
Oh No!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, oh, oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, oh, oh,

Please God forgive,
for what I did,
this day will stay for as long as I live,
'Cause if you walked in
and seen what I seen
I know any man would have done just the same.
Please God forgive (No!),
for what I did (No!)
This day will stay for as long as I live,
'Cause if you walked in (No!)
In and seen what I seen, (No!)
I know any man would have done just the same because...i

[Chorus]
I never thought that I'd do something like that,
When I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack,
Oh No!
How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd lose my temper like that,
Now its some fucked up situation,
He ain't coming back!
Oh No!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

[Outro]
