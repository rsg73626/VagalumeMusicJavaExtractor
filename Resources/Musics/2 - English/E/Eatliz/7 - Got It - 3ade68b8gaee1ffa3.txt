GOT IT

It got me going like a wonder
It's like a walking disaster
It got me going through my senses
& maybe I could learn from your master
It got me going from the first time
& maybe it's like
You got it too...

Ha ha ha....

It's got a hunger like a monster
& all the ways of a hunter
I gotta hide in my defenses
& maybe I could learn from a stranger
I think I got it from my mother
& maybe it's like you got it too
