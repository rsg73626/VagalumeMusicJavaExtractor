MIX ME

Mix me with your sulfur soul
Please please

Mix me with your sulfur soul
Please please
Silver blood spilled all over me
It feels like fire,
Running higer

Silver blood spilled all over me
It feels like fire,
Coursing higher 
if there could be someone
That lives with me
If there could be
Only a recipe
To imagine that we've all
Got broken engines
