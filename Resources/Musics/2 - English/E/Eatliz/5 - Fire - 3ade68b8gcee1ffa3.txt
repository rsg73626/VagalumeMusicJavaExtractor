FIRE

Fire

You have won what you wanted
All I've given
You're not the one
Inside out
Shifting your doubts
Ride your highways
I'm not the one
Now I get caught up in the sun

Feels like fire
Fire (x3)

You have won what you hunted
All I've given
You're not the one

You are one
With your moments
All I've given
Now I must run

How I get caught up in the sun

Feels like fire
Fire (x3)
You are one with your moments
All I've given circles the sun
