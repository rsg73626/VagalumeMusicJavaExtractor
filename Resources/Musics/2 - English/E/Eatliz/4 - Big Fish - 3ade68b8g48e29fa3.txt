BIG FISH

They treat you
Real nice
The drinks are 
With ice
I kissed you good night
We must not fight

Although I did it
I'll make you take the blame
I'll make you take the blame
I'll do it again

Although I did it
I'll make you take the blame
I'll make you take the blame
I'll do it again

I do not wish to know where I am
I do not wish to know where you are
I do not wish to know where you're from 
I do not wish to be anywhere

My liver is so old
All purple & gold
We started to dance
I woke up in france

Although I did it
I'll make you take the blame
I'll make you take the blame
I'll do it again

Although I did it
I'll make you take the blame
I'll make you take the blame
I'll do it again

I do not wish to know where I am
I do not wish to know where you are
I do not wish to know where you're from 
I do not wish to be anywhere


I do not wish to know where I am
I do not wish to know where you are
I do not wish to know where you're from 
I do not wish to be anywhere
