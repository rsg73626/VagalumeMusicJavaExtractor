ATTRACTIVE

Tip toeing on salty sand
My pink glasses work so wonderfully,
One more moment on
And it's gone.

Where ever you are, are
If you find me attractive
Who ever you are

Where ever you are, are
If you find me attractive
Who ever you are

Don't hesitate...
Everything's got to move on
If you wanna ride on my spiders
Everything's got to move on

Tip toeing on salty sand
My pink glasses work so wonderfully,
One more moment on
And it's gone.

Where ever you are, are
If you find me attractive
Who ever you are

Where ever you are, are
If you find me attractive
Who ever you are

Don't hesitate...
Everything's got to move on
If you wanna ride on my spiders
Everything's got to move on

Where ever you are
If you find me attractive
Who ever you are

Where ever you are, are
If you find me attractive
Who ever you are

Don't hesitate...
Everything's got to move on

My pink glasses work so wonderfully......
