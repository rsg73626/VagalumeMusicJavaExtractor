LOSE THIS CHILD

Lose this child
He's in your arms
Lose this child

Who's in charge?
It's in your mind
Lose this child

Send it to the sky
Save it in your smile
Send it to the moon
Say it like you don't care

Send it to the sky
Save it for a while
Send it to the moon
Say it like you're not there

Fools to try to spill my wine
Are they blind?
