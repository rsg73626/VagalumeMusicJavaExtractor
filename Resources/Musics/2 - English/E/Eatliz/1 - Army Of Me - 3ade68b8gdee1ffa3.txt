ARMY OF ME

Stand up
You've got to manage
I won't sympathize
Anymore

And if you complain once more
You'lll meet an army of me

You're alright
There's nothing wrong
Self sufficience please!
And get to work

And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me

You're on your own now
We won't save you
Your rescue squad
Is too exhausted
