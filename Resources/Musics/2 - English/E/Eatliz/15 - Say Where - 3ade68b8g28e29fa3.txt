SAY WHERE

When you will come with me 
Into my hell
I will have to stay there
While you can be anywhere

Take me back to the end of time
Take me back to reveal my crime
Take me back to the end

You’ll be in heaven while 
My angels dwell
Find my way to get there
I’d follow you anywhere

Take me back to the end of time
Take me back to reveal my crime
Take me back to the end

Hey you pretty boy I was just looking for you

I will stay there
I'll follow you anywhere
