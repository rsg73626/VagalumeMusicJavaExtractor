NO-FEELINGS

Jump between the mines
Don't step on
Jump between the lines
Don't step on
One foot on the ground
At all
All times

One foot on the ground at all
At all times so you won't fall
Don't forget you count
Don't slow down
On the ground at all times
One foot on the ground at all times

Jump between the mines
Don't step
On the lines & mind the gaps
One foot on the ground
At all times
So you won't fall
