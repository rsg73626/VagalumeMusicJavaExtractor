SUNSHINE

We've shared this land forever
But we've never looked around
To see
We co-exist for years
We're desert people
We are trees
We talk love to each other
Common interest
Common fears
Respecting ourselves
Respecting our lands
Respecting our self destruction

We should be lying
In the sunshine together
We should be lying
In the sunshine together

We've shared this land forever
But we've never looked around
To see
We co-exist for years
We're desert people
We are trees
We talk love to each other
Common interest
Common fears
Respecting ourselves
Respecting our lands
Respecting our self destruction

We should be lying
In the sunshine together
We should be lying
In the sunshine together
We should be lying
In the sunshine We should be lying
In the sunshine- together...
