SPLIFF

Every time someone's getting
Into my life
I find my self just hating
Everything that he does
Hope your heart is
Bigger than mine

I just want you
To get out of my view
Take a look at the mirror
There's a picture of you
Promise you that one day I'll wake up
And destroy all the stuff
That connects my own self
To your stupid ideas
