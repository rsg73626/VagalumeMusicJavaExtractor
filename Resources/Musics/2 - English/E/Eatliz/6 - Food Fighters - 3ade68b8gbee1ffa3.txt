FOOD FIGHTERS

Run in circles
Try to catch a ride
Such a hopeless state
Lose your patience when you realize
You're like a live bait
Run, run, run around

You won't feel like I'm there

Run in circles
Try to catch my breath
On this battle ground
Wave my white flag
Now you know I'm done
So give up what you found
Run, run, run around

You won't feel like I'm there

Don't tell me what I know
Don't talk just let it go
Don't think it doesn't show
Don't
