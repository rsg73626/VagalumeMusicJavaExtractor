I DON'T CARE

I wanted to say but I don't care
I don't care

I wanted to say but I don't care
I don't care

I wanted to give but I don't share
I don't share
I don't
I don't share

I like the sun and I wanna be
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us

With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
With me

I don't care

I like the sun
And I wanna be 
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us

With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
With me

I like the sun 
and I wanna be in the sun

I like the sun 
and I wanna be in the sun

With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
With you riding on an icy dancing floor tonight
The river takes us
