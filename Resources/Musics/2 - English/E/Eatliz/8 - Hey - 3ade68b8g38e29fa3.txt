HEY

Hey
I long to play
All the dreams I sent out
But one stayed
Behind to play
Hand a purple crayon
And paint the rainbow
In graceful colors
You don't like it
I see it in your face
And drink it through my finger tips

Hey
I long to play
All the dreams I Shipped out
But one stayed
Behind to play
Hand another crayon
And paint the rainbow
In graceful colors
You don't like it
I see it in your face
And drink it through my finger tips

Hey
I long to play
All the babies gone now
But mine stayed
In my mind to play
Mind tricks on me now
Insanity is taking over
I don't feel a thing
You see it in my face
And drink it through my finger tips...
