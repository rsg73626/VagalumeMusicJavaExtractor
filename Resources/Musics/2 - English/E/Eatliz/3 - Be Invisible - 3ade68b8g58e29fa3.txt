BE INVISIBLE

On a river fish are dancing
We were safely still
On the same spot on the hill
Thinking that I'm not real
You drove me mad as we were
Safely still
On the same spot on the hill
If you want
You've got to be invisible
To see it all...

On a river fish are dancing
We were safely still
On the same spot on the hill
Thinking that I'm not real
You drove me mad as we were
Safely still
On the same spot on the hill
If you want
You've got to be invisible
To see it all...

On a river fish are smiling
