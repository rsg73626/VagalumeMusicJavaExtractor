CHUM

Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slower, degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
Golf is stitched into my shirt

Get up off the pavement
Brush the dirt up off my psyche, psyche, psyche

It's probably been twelve years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it
I would swallow it

Sixteen, I'm hollow with Tyler and skipped shots
Just throw him that whole bottle
I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk pissy pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how
and when the fuck I missed moderate

Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
Plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice with the trap

Too black for the white kids and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to to cracking
locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained
and I'm frightened it's evident
In them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at

Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slower, degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
Golf is stitched into my shirt

Get up off the pavement
Brush the dirt up off my psyche, psyche, psyche

Time lapse, bars rot in heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as 96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the potty mouth posse, crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss 'em out to the audience

Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom this is
Feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment
and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles
and entering apartments with 'zine article

Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas'll track me down
Just to be the guys that did it like I like attention
Not the type where niggas
trying to get a raise at my expense

Supposed to be grateful, right
Like thanks so much you made my life
Harder and the ties between my mom and I
Strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slower, degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
Golf is stitched into my shirt

Get up off the pavement
Brush the dirt up off my psyche, psyche, psyche
