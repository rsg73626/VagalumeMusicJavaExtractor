UNCLE AL

Salmon skin band-aid help with recovery
Diction buttery, grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed
Depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt

Killing who you sinning first, verse
Wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas
find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage
throw a brick and pour the henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew
in this music shit

For versace suicidal, I hit the jake through the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit
leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the street
from what 'roma was stank though
Product of the villainy, product capable, plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas
who probably was gonna remain broke
