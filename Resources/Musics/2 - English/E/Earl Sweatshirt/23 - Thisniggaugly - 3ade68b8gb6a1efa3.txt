[Verse: Tyler the Creator]
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side of Sacramento
But this fag ain't just visiting, he's settling in
He can't wait to start meddling and doing the evil shit we do
(Does he skate?) Yeah, he skate too
(Man, this nigga ugly) And he raps, ooh
This the newest Wolf Gang member
And he.. (What's his name?) Earl

[Outro: Taco and Tyler]
Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fucking big
This nigga, look at this fucking nigga's lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae
Yo, this nigga's line is bended! (That's fucked up)
Yo, this nigga, this nigga look like an African poet (Earl, say something)
Yo, this nigga's forehead looks like a fucking big ass nooch
(Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say something, trust me guys, he can rap)
He a bitch! (Just say something
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say something)
Nigga, rap, you fucking suck probably
(Trust me guys, he can rap, just say something)
