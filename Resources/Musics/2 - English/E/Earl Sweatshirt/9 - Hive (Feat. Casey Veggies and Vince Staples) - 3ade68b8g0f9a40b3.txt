HIVE (FEAT. CASEY VEGGIES AND VINCE STAPLES)

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up
after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it, in turn these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spit, it just burn like six furnaces
Written to fix learning them digits and simultaneously
Dispelling "one-trick-pony" myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fucking six nigga energy
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting, thrashing
these niggas done let the Kraken out
Crack-a-lackin, like snap, crackle
poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off
Sweatshirt, nigga

[Hook: Casey Veggies (Earl Sweatshirt) ]
'87 roof top rising
Whipping hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop
hock vomit up, sub rocking
Thud knocking niggas teeth loose)
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cops
(Rolling with that flow swamp)
Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock)
(Passionless in old Jive clothing
with them doors wide open)
(Dim the floor lights focused)
Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
From that city that's recession-hit, where stressed
Niggas could flex metal with pedal to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news: death's less important
when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
(Poof) Disappear again, reappear bearded on
Top of a lear steering it into the kids' ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the black top
Salivary glands lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the little Nick, nimble, rickrolling
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Quit with all that tough talk, bruh
we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is
Got 'em wishing that they never gave
these weapons to kids, cheers
Send chills up spines of fat bitches after
Shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it how they
Live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money
Little boy told me when it's time to ride
they'll send them for me
Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94 would have had them walking down Death Row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me wet 'em if they test you
So it's raging water season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson
leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing
Kittens soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it
But to each his own, I ain't tripping
long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em free Smalls, off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby Jay, bony niggas spraying Ks
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

[Outro]
Like it's nothing cause it's nothing, bitch
