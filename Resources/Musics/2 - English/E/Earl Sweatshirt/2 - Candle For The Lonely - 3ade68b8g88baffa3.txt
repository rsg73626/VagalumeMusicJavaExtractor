CANDLE FOR THE LONELY

Light a candle for all the lonely
Like I used to be so I know
How it feels with no one and only
No sweetheart, nobody to hold

A where oh where is the someone for everyone
They say that swims in the sea

I know it's out there for you,

Can't you believe

That in your heart you have saved a place
For the one who is looking for you
And all your friends and your family they are
Pulling for love to come through

Out there somewhere is someone for everyone
No matter who you might be

I know it can happen for you, it happened for me

If I had just one gift to give you

I'd wish you a love like I've found
So keep your head up, don't give up hope

And remember the world turns around;

So I'll light a candle for all the lonely
Like I used to be so I know
