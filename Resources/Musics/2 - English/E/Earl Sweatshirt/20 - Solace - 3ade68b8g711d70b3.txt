SOLACE

Late for everything, my face to the cement
That's how I always seen it
I spent days faded and anemic
You could see it in my face
I ain't been eatin', I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that river phoenix
Went gon' end up my fate

And when they drag me out the gutter
Mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, winnin' if the pen hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch on myspace
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways

It was like that the whole time, we'll be alright
Stay up all night, but it's alright
I done stayed up the whole night, but it's alright
It's me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
It's trouble, the way that we're joggin'

Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
This spliff, I ain't splittin' no time soon
My brain split in two, it's rainin' a bit
I hope it's a monsoon, my face in the sink
I'm seein' my mom soon, I'm faded, I stink
Stay in it

I got my grandmama's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most cause I feel defeated
And I buy nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my hec
My hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed
Her most cause I feel defeated

And I buy nothin' but myself, my second thoughts
My hectic process of thinkin'
And all my doubts and I think
I know nak in there sleepin'
He on the couch, that's my brother
Give me a boost when my confidence need it
So I love him, to tell the truth

I got a problem with eatin'
I be druggin', to tell the truth
I'm not supposed to be off in here
I'm supposed to be sleepin'
But I be turnin' and tossin'
To tell the truth, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, you can't be loud
When you're the wrongest, fam
To tell the truth, I'm at a loss of friends
Well time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands
I'm the youngest old man that you know
If ya soul intact, let me know
