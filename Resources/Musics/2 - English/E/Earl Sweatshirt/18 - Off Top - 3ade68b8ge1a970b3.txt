OFF TOP

Yo I gotta stop smoking backwoods
"How you doing? " and what's your motive, ho?
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em
Trying to pay my momma rent
figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin easy down this narrow path
beefin' with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga that's a great lunch, poppa
Swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come

Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth
get taped shut
Peep the evening news my nigga
we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy I'm jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change
I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the motorola razr
What a bastard that baby was, little mad nigga missing dad
Never praying much

Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga da$h with me
He sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air
cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy
You berries and you honey for the bear
that's here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands make it hasty
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
