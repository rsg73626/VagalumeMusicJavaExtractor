INTERFACE

The roll week was don't fuck shape
A hurry so thirty-blake is fuck and interface
Increase so rock and shape to the party
Black very good
And so, and so, and so, and so

Don't shapes roll on the interface
The walls on the shape very stumbed
And the walls have clocked and traved
This is the one day

The all of fuck rim on the round
And noise is the shock and rock and through
Give me in brake
