INSIDE YOUR HEAD

Ding dong the clock is wrong 
Dong ding 
Tick tock stubborn clock 
Tock tick 

Inside your head [2x]

Still water sparkles here 
The calm drifts away in here 
Cuddle cravings addiction brings 
Place your coat on six strings

Inside your head [2x]

I wouldn´t want to be inside your head.....
