SOBER IN JUNE

I’m gonna be sober in june
Bounce off the sofa before noon
I´m gonna be sober in june
My little loon

I´m gonna get out of this mess
Sort out my finance I guess
I´m gonna feel the flavour of success
I´m sucha mess

I’m gonna be sober in june
Bounce off the sofa before noon
I´m gonna be sober in june
My little loon

I’m so fucked up now that I must be in love somehow
I’m so fucked up now that I must feel for you somehow
I’m so fucked up now that I must be in love
In love, bin the love
In love, bin the love
