WHAT IF

Let's say,
I fell into place, I feel much better
I don't remember a thing
Would it make you think of me as normal again?

Let's say,
I found a way to climb up this ladder
Won't stay down here for long
Would it make me worthy in your eyes?

You act as if you have no weaknesses
I'm sorry I'm not perfect like you

What if,
I went and told everyone my story
And how you treated me?
Would it make you feel ashamed?

No, I'm not being sarcastic
Would you like me to erase
Who I am, where I came from,
What you did to me?

You act as if you have no weaknesses
I'm sorry I'm not perfect like you
Don't you get tired of wearing your mask?
I'm sorry I'm not careless like you

No, I'm not being revengeful
Just trying to find out
Who you are, where you came from,
What I did to you

You act as if you have no weaknesses
I'm sorry I'm not perfect like you
Don't you get tired of wearing your mask?
I'm sorry I'm not careless like you
