MEMORIES

Funny how in just one moment things can turn upside down
Wish I could turn back time to when you were still around
All I've got left is memories of your face smiling at me
Used to say that we should all just handle this differently

Took us all by surprise
No, we never saw this coming
Always were, always will be our hero
With no warning sign
One day they came
And took you away

Remember everything that you said, how we can never fully trust them
Wish I could say I disagree but I know they're the ones to blame
Destroyed every hope we once had
Nothing we can do now that you're gone, no way to bring you back

Took us all by surprise
No, we never saw this coming
Always were, always will be our hero
With no warning sign
One day they came
And took you away

Things can be so unfair
You were taken away before your time
Now we're all sitting here, nothing left for us to say
Donâ€™t want to leave you behind

Took us all by surprise
No, we never saw this coming
Always were, always will be our hero
With no warning sign
One day they came
And took you away
