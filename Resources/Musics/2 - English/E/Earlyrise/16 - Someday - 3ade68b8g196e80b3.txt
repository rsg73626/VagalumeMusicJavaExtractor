SOMEDAY

I'll wake up from this slumber someday, someday
I'll find my long lost answers someday
someday when I get out of here
I know I will get better someday
I know this will be over sooner than what you say

I know things will be better someday, someday
I know this will we over someday
someday when I get out of here
And I try to get closer
Try to make an escape
Everything will be better
someday, someday

I know I'm gonna have to wait it out
until I fulfill my only prophecy
I know all my sacrificing will pay off
someday when I get out of here
I know I will get better someday, someday
I know this will be over sooner than what you say

I know things will be better someday, someday
I know this will we over someday
someday when I get out of here
And I try to get closer
Try to make an escape
Everything will be better
someday, someday

It's like I'm crawling through a part
of the story that I wish I could fast forward
I know it's only a matter of a little time
'til I move on

I know things will be better someday, someday
I know this will we over someday
someday when I get out of here

(It's like I'm crawling through a part
