CHINA

Everywhere you go they grab your hand and don't let go
Try to make you stay
They embrace you, give you everything you need
But they don't understand

One more day in your world, you keep on trying to avoid
Listening to what they say
All caught up in yourself, can't stop dwelling on the past
Just another wasted day

No, you don't care about what they tell you
They just make you feel insane
And you won't talk about what you've been through
You just live with the pain

They can't see through your eyes, you stand aside and analyze
Every move that they make
But if you take a good look around, it won't be long until you find
They care for you and everything they do is for your own good

No, you don't care about what they tell you
They just make you feel insane
And you won't talk about what you've been through
You just live with the pain

Why don't you give up the fight?
They might not always be right
But there's another way to fix this
Just let them into your world
Let everything unfold
Don't be afraid to let go of your loneliness

No, you don't care about what they tell you
They just make you feel insane
And you won't talk about what you've been through
You just live with the pain
