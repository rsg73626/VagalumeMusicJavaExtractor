LEAVE ME ALONE

Don't tell me to stop
No, you don't exactly set a good example
Stay right where you are while you criticize me
I can't bear your lecture

I think I've figured out
What you're all about
So maybe you should leave me the fuck alone

Talk about your plans
But you don't do anything but praise yourself
You don't appreciate me
And what I do is never good enough
For you

Spent too much of my time trying to please you
Didn't get me anywhere
Now I can't afford to waste another second
From now on I'm gonna do it my way

Now all you talk about
Is how bad I turned out
Guess you'll never leave me the fuck alone

Talk about your plans
But you don't do anything but praise yourself
You don't appreciate me
And what I do is never good enough
For you

Look at me, on my own now
And I'm better than ever
Don't wanna play on the safe side
And end up just like you

Talk about your plans
But you don't do anything but praise yourself
You don't appreciate me
And what I do is never good enough
For you
