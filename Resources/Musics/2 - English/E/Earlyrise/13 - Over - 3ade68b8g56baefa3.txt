OVER

Weâ€™re slipping down, we're climbing up
Seems like we've reached a dead end
We keep fighting, keep making up
Looks like we're going nowhere

Doesn't help when you try to cover it up
You know we're growing apart
Doesn't help when you lose your mind completely
You just push me farther away

I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to move on now
'cause you're really starting to get on my nerves
I'm waiting 'til you get back home
So I can finally get this over with

So sick of telling you what to do
God damn, I ain't your mother
Keep listening to you whining
Don't know why I even bother

And I don't wanna pretend and push you around
'cause it's just gonna make it worse
There's no point in trying to convince me
Don't feel anything anymore

I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to move on now
'cause you're really starting to get on my nerves
I'm waiting 'til you get back home
So I can finally get this over with
