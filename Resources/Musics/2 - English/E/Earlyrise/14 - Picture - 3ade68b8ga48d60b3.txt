PICTURE

I will always remember
The picture I had in my mind
Of us growing together
I never thought I'd leave you behind

And we shared the same vision
We were never gonna quit
And I always thought you'd stay till the end
And I wish you the best
No matter where you go
And you'll always have a place in my heart

We were already so close
To gathering all the pieces
We kept going against all odds
And never compromised on what we wanted

And we shared the same vision
We were never gonna quit
And I always thought you'd stay till the end
But I wish you the best
No matter where you go
And you'll always have a place in my heart

Follow your own way
Follow your own beliefs
Run free, be happy
Just remember me

Follow your own way
Follow your own beliefs
Run free, be happy
Just remember me

And we shared the same vision
We were never gonna quit
And I always thought you'd stay till the end
But I wish you the best
No matter where you go
And you'll always have a place in my heart

I will always remember
I will always remember
