OBLIVIOUS

This evil disease took over you
Erasing everything you knew
You tried your hardest to hold on

You don't even recognize my face
Exploring this unfamiliar place
I wonder what it's like to start all over again

Things could have been so much better
If only you had stayed the same
Trying hard to point the finger
There's no one here that we can blame

Just give me time, and I'll be fine
Make up for every wasted moment
Oblivious, forgot about us
You left without a sign of warning

I'm watching you stray these halls alone
Singing the same repeating song
You stare at everyone as if they were strangers

Things could have been so much better
If only you had stayed the same
Trying hard to point the finger
There's no one here that we can blame

Just give it time, and you'll be fine
Make up for every wasted moment
Oblivious, forgot about us
You left without a sign of warning
