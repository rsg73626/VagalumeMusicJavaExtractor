FACE ME

Step out of the shade, and I'm not afraid anymore
Yes, I declare war
I won't fall asleep, I'll stay up and keep singing this song
Until I prove you wrong

Will you ever realize it's not my fault?
Should care about your situation, but I don't
'cause if you think of it, you brought this on yourself
Can't blame me for the wrong choices that you made

So why let this all die, after everything we've been through?
Just try to compromise

Are you listening to anything I'm saying anyway
Or do you just not care?
Now you've crossed the line, you can't take what's mine
Not this time
I won't let it pass me by

Will you ever realize it's not my fault?
Should care about your situation, but I don't
'cause if you think of it, you brought this on yourself
Can't blame me for the wrong choices that you made

So why let this all die, after everything we've been through?
Just try to compromise

Why don't you face me for once instead of looking away?
It's time to break your silence
Are you gonna keep playing dead 'til everybody's gone
You better change before you end up all alone

Why let this all die, after everything we've been through?
Just try to compromise
