ALL YOU KNOW

What's the story?
You know, you know

I've seen it all already
I can't stand the silence
Please wake me up
There's gotta be forwards
My thoughts are empty
I feel like I have no story
Please wake me up
There's gotta be forwards

What's the story? Tell me Ahh
You know, you know
Put me down right where
I need more, need more
Ahh ahh Ahh ahh

I'm surrounded by so many, but
Lying to their faces
Please take me back to when I was alive
I might seem contented, happy
Just hiding from loneliness
Please take me back to when I was alive

What's the story? Tell me Ahh
You know, you know
Put me down right where
I need more, need more
Ahh ahh Ahh ahh

Unlock the gates are learning
The truth is on the other side
Remind me what I'm breathing for
Cause I was meant for more
Unlock the gates are learning
The truth is on the other side
Remind me what I'm breathing for
Cause I was meant for more

What's the story? Tell me Ahh
You know, you know
Put me down right where
I need more, need more
What's the story? Tell me Ahh
You know, you know
Put me down right where
I need more, need more
Ahh ahh Ahh ahh
What's the story? Tell me
