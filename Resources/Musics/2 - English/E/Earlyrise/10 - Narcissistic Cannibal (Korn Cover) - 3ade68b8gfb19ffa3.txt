NARCISSISTIC CANNIBAL (KORN COVER)

Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down

And you're so cynical, Narcisstic Cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me taking it's sweet time?

Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

Don't wanna be rude, but I have to
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through
I just need to look around
See that life that has come unbound

And you're so cynical, Narcisstic Cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me taking it's sweet time?

Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me taking...

Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days
