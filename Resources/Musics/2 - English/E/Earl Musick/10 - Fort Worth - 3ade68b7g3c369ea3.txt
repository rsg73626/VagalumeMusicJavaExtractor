FORT WORTH

I’m going back to Fort Worth, Where the true west begins
It’s in the fork of the Trinity’s, I’m gonna sing for my friends
A true native son, I’m proud to shout
32 miles from Dallas, where the East peters out

Lost my imagination, in them Tennessee hills
Held no infatuation, facts it gave me the chills
Why I went there who’ll ever know
Up rooted my life for a new place to grow

I crossed a desert of fire, just to get to Los Angeles
Careful where you walk, you’ll get hit by an ambulance
Stick Rodeo drive in Beverly’s ear
Mix a thimble of soul with a dash of sincere

Up state was a drag, I wish I was an engine
It’s cold in the summer, starts me a grinnin’
My stay there was entirely too long
Don’t believe that old story, you’ll go home for a song

That’s why I’m going back to Fort Worth, where the true west begins
It’s in the fork of the Trinity’s, I’m gonna sing for my friends
A true native son, I’m proud to shout
32 miles from Dallas, where the East peters out

That’s why I’m going back to Fort Worth, where the true west begins
