LUV ME UP

So won't you luv me up
I can't get enough
Like that wind driving rain
She's driving me insane
When she luvs me up

She got a sweet disposition
She causes deep suspicions
With that lightning in her eyes
She makes me realize
When she luvs me up

We're sittin' on the floor
It's a quarter till four
In the morning with you
We're sippin' wine
We're sweet talking
Spending the night with you

So won't you luv me up
I can't get enough
Like that wind driving rain
She's driving me insane
When she luvs me up

So won't you luv me up
I can't get enough
Like that wind driving rain
She's driving me insane
When she luvs me up

We're sittin' on the floor
It's a quarter till four
In the morning with you
We're sippin' wine
We're sweet talking
Spending the night with you
