SEASONS

Autumn leaves are falling
Tumbling to the ground
Old north wind is howling
No one left around

And it blows where it may
Blows where it may

Winter snows are coming
Leaves have all turned brown
No one left at home
But me and my poor old hound

And he roams where he may
Roams where he may

Spring time is coming
Sun is in the west
Sunshine warms your soul
It puts your mind at rest

And I roam where I may
Roam where I may

Winter snow has gone now
Leaves have all turned green
Pickin' with some friends
That I haven't seen

And we play where we may
Play where we may

Play!
