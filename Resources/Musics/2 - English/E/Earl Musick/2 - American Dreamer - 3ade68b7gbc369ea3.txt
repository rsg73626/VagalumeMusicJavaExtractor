AMERICAN DREAMER

I got the sun in my face
I got the wind at my back
Got you on my mind
And I'm making tracks
Got to get back
Where we used to be
When there was nobody else
just you and me

You've always done
What everybody wanted
you never got your story straight
You got your chance now
You better take it
I hope you haven't waited too late

So tell it, tell it
Sing it loud
Try to draw yourself a crowd
And if you want what
You can't be
You need good PR
And national TV

Big and Bold
Black and white
Spread across the page
Have you seen it
Have you read it
It is all the rage

Well I've been thinking
Taking chances
Been waiting on the moon to rise
Some are chosen
Others denied
Well I just wonder why

So tell it, tell it
Sing it loud
Try to draw yourself a crowd
If you want what
You can't be
You need good PR
And national TV
