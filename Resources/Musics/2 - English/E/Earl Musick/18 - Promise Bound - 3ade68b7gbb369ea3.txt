PROMISE BOUND

Gonna tell you ‘bout train bound for glory
They say the conductor tells a beautiful story
Bout singin’ in the choir, playin’ in the band
Dancin’ in the aisles, and clappin hands…

I wanna ride… I wanna ride…
I wanna ride on down to the promise land

The train’s comin’ down, to my sleepy town 
With a hundred or so, souls outward bound
Waiting on a platform; ticket in hand, 
Along with another woman child and man…

I wanna ride… I wanna ride…
To where my bothers and sisters all hold hands.

When the train whistle blows that mournful sound 
Reverberatin’ and shakin’ the ground
Grab up grampa’s mandolin, 
Tunin’ it up and then playin’ it again

I wanna ride… I wanna ride…
I wanna ride on down to the promise land.

We’re Singin’ “Greatful, humble and proud.”
We’re cryin’ out loud…
“Promise Bound…”

Train came to rest at the depot door, 
Stepped right off to a dancehall floor…
Conductor said he’d call us in time
Said “This ain’t no Amtrak Line…”

I wanna ride… I wanna ride…
I wanna ride on down to the promise land.

A “Fender Deluxe” buzzin’ in my ear
Kick Drum and Bass, playin low and clear
Joint was jumpin, and the crowd was mine, 
But it’s time to get back on the Promise Bound Line

I wanna ride… I wanna ride…
To where my brothers and sisters all hold hands.

Back to the train bound for glory 
The conductor tells another beautiful story
‘Bout singin’ in the choir, playin’ in the band
Dancin’ in the aisles and clappin hands…

I wanna ride… I wanna ride…
I wanna ride on down to the promise land.

We’re singin’ “Greatful, humble and proud" 
We’re cryin’ out loud…
We’re singin’ “Greatful, humble and proud" 
For cryin’ out loud…

I'm Promise Bound
