TEXAS MOON

There’s a ring around that Texas moon,
That means it’ll be raining soon…
Get the clothes in off the line,
Wind is blowing, ain’t got much time.

Hope the roof don’t blow off that old shed,
Cuz back in the west, there’s a thunderhead.
Skies so black, it’ll scare the dead
Better grab the kids, get under the bed.

It’s never to much, it’s never to little
Rain around here is welcome as viddles. 
You learn early on, “don’t begrudge the rain” 
Cuz you never when it’s comin' back again.

A good downpour is clean and refreshin’
As long as those clouds don’t start ‘a twistin’
Cows and flat rocks, cats and dogs…
Bridge washed out, and stranglin’ frogs.

It’s never to much, it’s never to little
Rain around here is welcome as viddles. 
You learn early on, “don’t begrudge the rain” 
Cuz you never when it’s comin' back again.

It soaks the crops and fills the tanks,
We all owe Mother Nature a big “thanks”
Tip your hat and count your blessins’
Thanks the Lord you were born a Texan
