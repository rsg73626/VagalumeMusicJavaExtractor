BRIGHT AND SHINY BLUES

Must’ve been about a year ago
The sun was setting in the East
I was living down in Mexico

Staring out my window
I guess I’m settling in…
Cars goin’ by, people getting’ high
Grinnin’ that silly-ass grin

There’s not much you can do…
When you got them Bright and Shiny Blues…

Shine your light in my eyes
And tell me where you think I’ve been
You can’t tell nothing about me
From the color of my skin

Check the clock on the wall
It’s later than it’s ever been
Won’t see me next Sunday
I’m living’ the original sin

There’s not much you can do…
When you got them Bright and Shiny Blues…

You look so confused
Is there a message that you’re trying to send?
Do you want to leave right now
Or wait till the party ends

You can come back home with me
I’ve got a lotta stories to tell…
About smoking guns, bastard sons
And living in cheap motels

There’s not much you can do…
When you got them Bright and Shiny Blues…

There’s not much you can do…
When you got them Bright and Shiny Blues…
