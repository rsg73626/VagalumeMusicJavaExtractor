A GOOD THING JUST GOT BETTER

A good thing just got better
We're taking on a new look
We've been celebrating
Doing what we should
So clap your hands; take a stand
Let's raise a little cain
One thing's for certain
Nothing stays the same

You've been trying to tell me
Just what I had in store
Well I've saved it up, cashed it in
Now I'm back for more

The door swung open, she walked in
She is a friend of mine
She got all the answers
She got a perfect disguise
I've got mixed emotions, she said
I've got a lot on my mind
I'm gonna put my foot down baby
I'm gonna lay it on the line

You've been trying to tell me
Just what I had in store
Well I've saved it up, cashed it in
Now I'm back for more

A good thing just got better
We're taking a new look
We've been celebrating
Doing what we should
Clap your hands, take a stand
Let's raise a little cain
One thing's for certain
You know nothing stays the same

You've been trying to tell me
Just what I had in store
Well I've saved it up, cashed it in
Now I'm back for more

A good thing just got better
A good thing just got better
A good thing just got better
A good thing just got better
