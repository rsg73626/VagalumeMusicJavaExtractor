DOING THINGS

Now I'm sittin here by that old telephone
I'm wondering what, what went wrong
You got me doing things
I wouldn't want you to know

Now some women drink whiskey
And other drink rye
Well, you'll drink anything
That old guy will buy
You got me doing things
I wouldn't want you to know

I've sang about the good times
I've sang about the bad
Overnight sensations 
That we've all had

But nothing comes close 
To the feeling I get
When I'm hit between the eyes
With a direct hit
You got me doing things
I wouldn't want you to know
You got me doing things
I wouldn't want you to know

Now I'll go and tell you
You look good in blue
You change your clothes
And your hairdo too
You got me doing things
I would want you to know

Now I'm sittin here
My old head hangin' down
You're the reason I'm out
Running around
You got me doing things
I wouldn't want you to know
You got me doing things
I wouldn't want you to know
