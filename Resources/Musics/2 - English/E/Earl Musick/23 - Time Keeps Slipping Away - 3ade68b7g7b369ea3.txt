TIME KEEPS SLIPPING AWAY

Woke up this morning
At the crack of dawn
Fifteen minutes before the
News comes on

Drinking coffee
Scratching my head
Wishing that I could go back to bed

As the time keeps slippin' away
That's O.K.
Cause I never meant to be here that long anyway

Sitting here thinking
Of bygone days
The fun I had, and the
Hell I raised

No regrets
An no remorse
I chose my path 
And I held my course

As the time keeps slippin' away
That's O.K.
Cause I never meant to be here that long anyway

Down on Hard Street
Bad Luck Avenue
Did my times singing them
White-boy blues

No regrets
And no remorse
I chose my path
And I held my course

As the time keeps slippin' away
That's O.K.
Cause I never meant to be here that long anyway
