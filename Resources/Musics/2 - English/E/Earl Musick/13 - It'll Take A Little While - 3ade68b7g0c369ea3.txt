IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE

Everybody Talking nobody listening
Everybody Looking nobody seeing
Everybody Taking nobody giving
Everybody dying it's time we start living again

It'll take a little while to say enough is enough
And it'll take a little while just to get off our butt's
And it'll take a little while to set things right
Changes don't come overnight

Everybody hustling nobody working
And everybody selling something nobody buying
Theirs so many hurting and to few a crying 
Well everybody dying it's time we start living again

And it'll take a little while to say enough is enough
And it'll take a little while just to get off our butts
And it'll take a little while to set things right
Changes don't come overnight

It'll take a little while
And it'll take a little while
And it'll take a little while
Just to set things right
Changes don't come overnight
Changes don't come overnight
I said changes don't come overnight

Everybody looking nobody
Nobody seeing
And everybody talking
Nobody hearing...
