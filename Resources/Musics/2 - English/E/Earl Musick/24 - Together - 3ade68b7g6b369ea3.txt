TOGETHER

Together we laugh, together we cry
Sound of your voice it makes me want to sigh
Happiness has grown day by day
You make me crazy when you've gone away

All of life's problems you think you can win
When others are critical you defend
Hearts speak and minds they think
Everybody knows that actions speak louder than 
Words

I've been blessed and I've been cursed
I've had better and I've had worse
It all seems the same to me
Hold your breath and don't let go
Don't sell your soul to the company store
It's a high price to be free

Things I never thought are perfectly clear
Things I've never seen before they seem to appear
Happiness has grown day by day
You make me crazy when you've gone away

All of life's problems you think you can win
When others are critical you defend
Hearts speak and minds they think
Everybody knows that actions speak louder than
Words

I've been blessed and I've been cursed
I've had better and I've had worse
It all seems the same to me
So hold your breath and don't let go
Don't sell your soul to the company store
It's a high price to be free

Singing woah woah woah woah woah
