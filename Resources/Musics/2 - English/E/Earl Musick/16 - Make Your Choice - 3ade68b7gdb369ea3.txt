MAKE YOUR CHOICE

Traffic's heavy
And the noise is loud
Do you go your own way
Or follow the crowd

It's inch by inch
And day by day
You make your choice
Then you better pray

It's inch by inch
And day by day
You make your choice
And then you better pray

With greed and power
The plot unfolds
Do you go your own way
Or do as your told
I've heard the best
Is yet to come
I'm optimistic but
I'm not dumb

It's inch by inch
And day by day
You make your choice
And then you better pray

What's right and what's wrong
And do we have a choice
Freedom is an illusion
If you drive a Rolls Royce

It's inch by inch
And day by day
You make your choice
And then you better pray
