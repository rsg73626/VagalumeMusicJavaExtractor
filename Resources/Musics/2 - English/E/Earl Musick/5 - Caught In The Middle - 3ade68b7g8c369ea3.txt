CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE

Say baby, well I know what you got
You got the kind of body
Got the kind of loving
That makes me screaming hot
Say baby, well I'm down on my knees
Saw you standing on the corner
Looking like a loner
But you looked so eager to please
Alright!

Say baby, well you ain't fooling me
Say I know you got another
Know you got a lover
And now it's easy to see
Cuz I'm caught in the middle
And I'm searching for a line
One that is sure fired
Sure fired to make you mine

Caught in the middle
And I'm hoping you will see
The way to paradise
Is to come on home with me
Say now I gotcha baby
You're laying by my side
Sweet as that summer heat
I'm gonna make you mine
Well I loved you in the morning
And I loved you through the night
Just come on now, just say you will
You know I'll treat you right

Caught in the middle
And I'm hoping you will see
The way to paradise
Is to come on home with me
