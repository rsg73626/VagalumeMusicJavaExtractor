FINE TIME TONIGHT

Summer skies and neon lights
Well it's party time
It's Saturday night

And we're going to have a fine time tonight
Having a fine time tonight
Things are changing and they're rearranging
Our lives

Bring your guitar and I'll bring mine
You know the beer is free
And the ladies, so fine

And we're going to have a fine time tonight
Having a fine time tonight
Things are changing and they're rearranging
Things are changing they're rearranging
Our lives

Summer skies and neon lights
Well it's party time
Cuz it's Saturday night

And we're going to have a fine time tonight
Having a fine time tonight
Things are changing and they're rearranging
Things are changing and they're rearranging
Said "Oops" they're rearranging our lives
