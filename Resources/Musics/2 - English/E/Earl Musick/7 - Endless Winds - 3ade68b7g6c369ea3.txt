ENDLESS WINDS

Here you are you're on my mind again
Just like those endless winds
Blowing by now and again
Just like those endless winds

She sends those shivers through me
Makes me want to howl and moan
Everytime i think about you child
And realize I was wrong
Well here I stand, I'm playing the fool
There she sits she's being cool
So cool

She sends those shivers through me
Makes me want to howl and moan
Everytime i think about you child
And realize I was wrong
Well here I stand, I'm playing the fool
There she sits she's being cool
So cool

The wind can be the breath of life
Or it can be a killing force It can power a sailing ship
If you set the proper course
Sometimes we lose, Lord
Sometimes we win
Always thank the Heavens for those
Endless winds
