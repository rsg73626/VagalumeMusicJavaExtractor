SANTA CRUZ

Yesterday I took one last look, when she walked away form me
Heading back to him, green’s all I could see
So I chunked it in a bag, bewildered and confused
Started walking toward the setting sun
Heading out to Santa Cruz

No Mr. I don’t want a ride, I think the walk will do me good
There’s things that never work, but I always thought we would
You win some, some get rained out
And there’s ones you're bound to lose
I’ll have this one sorted out, by the time I get to Santa Cruz

It ain’t home bit it’ll do, if it’s far enough away from you
To break these puppet strings in two and set me free
Though I won’t know a soul, a lonely so and so
Just a broken heart incognito with paid up dues
In Santa Cruz

It ain’t home but it’ll do, if it’s far enough away from you
To break these puppet strings in two and set me free
I won’t know a soul, a lonely so and so
Just a broken heart incognito with paid up dues
In Santa Cruz
