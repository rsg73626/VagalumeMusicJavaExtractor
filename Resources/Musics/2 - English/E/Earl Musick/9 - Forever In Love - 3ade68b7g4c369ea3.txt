FOREVER IN LOVE

It’s a western sky full of starlight, laced with magic
Please before we say one more word, would you hold me
From the canyon floor the heaven’s couldn’t be more romantic
It’s all for you and me, I can’t believe we’re part of this story

While the river rolls toward the sound of the falls in the distance
Love like a glove so sweet to the taste and the touch
As we swing and sway to the cricket choir’s eerie cadence
It’s all for you and me, I can’t believe we’ve been blessed with so much

And the closer I hold you the more that I mold you to my side
A true marriage of two souls forever sanctified
You more than perfect while I’m so undeserving
Still I pray you and me will forever be in love

As your cheeks grow flush they shine like gold in the fire light
And the passion grows so strong it dulls our senses
With no way to explain how this exquisite pain can feel so right
It’s all for you and me, we’ve lost all pretenses
Knock down the fences

Notch the pistol of fate for closing her gate behind us
I know you and me will forever be in love
Since it came from above We’ll always be forever in love
