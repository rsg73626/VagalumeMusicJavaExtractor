SAN ANTONE

The wind keeps blowing me back to San Antone
My hearts been breaking ever since you’ve been gone
I hope you’re sitting there waiting by the telephone
Cause the wind keeps blowing me back to San Antone

It started raining here about 4 am
You may be wondering what I was doing up then
Sitting here all alone writing this sad sad song
Cause the wind keeps blowing me back to San Antone

I don’t know how I ended ended up out west
The cold dark weather got me feeling depressed
I think it’s time I headed back to my home
Cause the wind keeps blowing me back to San Antone

Went to the station and bought my ticket today
Told my new friends I was going away
Said it was time for me to hit the road
Cause the wind keeps blowing me back to San Antone

Rolled in to San Antone about 6am
Felt so good you be back home again
No matter where I roam, no matter how long I’m gone
The wind keeps blowing me back to San Antone
