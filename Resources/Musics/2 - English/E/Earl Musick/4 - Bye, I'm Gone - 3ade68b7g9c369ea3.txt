BYE, I'M GONE

Came here looking for her, found you my first mistake
All those wild oats cultivated by a hoe and a rake
We split the sheets, so bitter sweet
Burned out cuz the fire just got to close
That don’t leave much to say, ‘cept Adios

Point me to the road that leaves town bro I know now I took a wrong turn
Sittin’ on go, tuned-in, topped-off and turned on
Since I pulled the plug and you jerked the rug
I guess a good-bye kiss would be too much
That don’t leave much to say ‘cept keep in touch

I’m just scared of how forever will be
Since I love you, more than you hate me

It was fun and it was real, it just wasn’t real fun
I don’t need a railroad watch, to tell me it’s time to run
I’ll be a long-gone daddy you’re as free-as-a-bird
If we done the right thing only time will tell
That don’t leave much to say ‘cept wish you well

I’m just scared of how for ever will be
Since I love you, more than you hate me

Light bill, water & gas all come to a hundred an twenty
I left that and fifty more on the dresser figured that’d be plenty
You can have a yard sale forward my mail
General delivery parts unknown
And that don’t leave much to say ‘cept bye I’m gone

And that don’t leave much to say….
