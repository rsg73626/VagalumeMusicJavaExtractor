HOOK, LINE AND SINGER

I cinch it up tight every Thursday night
I got a house band in Bosier city
Working for the door, for a dollar a head
Lord ain’t this a pity

I got a sweet little day gig that holds me together
I’m a backhoe operator
But you can go fly fishing with the music bug
Catch you an alligator

Hook line and singer
Hook line and singer
You can’t hardly shake ‘em
When a craw daddy takes the bait

Then The door flung open and in she strut
Hush puppy I’m a babbling fool
Talk about a back lash, eyes getting tangled
About the time she mounted that stool

She reeled me in on a treble hook
Hauled my but to the church
All the while I was faking my resisting 
Fighting back like a bellied up perch

Hook line and singer
Hook line and singer
You can’t hardly shake ‘em
When a craw daddy takes the bait
