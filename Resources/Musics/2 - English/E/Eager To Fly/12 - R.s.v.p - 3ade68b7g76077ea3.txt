R.S.V.P

I got your note the other day
Telling me it was coming back
All the feelings you thought were gone
Are flooding in
So you thought it was over
Cause you never sent the invitation

All your thoughts throw you on the floor
And the toll they take tears you to the core
But you thought it was over
You thought it was over
So you're sitting here all blue in the face
With your fingernails pale like the child next door
And you thought it was over
Oh, you thought it was over

I know where you've been my friend
Been through it more than I'd care to share
And you think you're the only one
So you thought it was over
Cause you never sent the invitation

All your thoughts throw you on the floor
And the toll they take tears you to the core
But you thought it was over
You thought it was over
So you're sitting here all blue in the face
With your fingernails pale like the child next door
And you thought it was over
Oh, you thought it was over

Someday we'll know freedom like He said we will
Someday we'll know freedom like He said we will
Someday we'll know freedom like He said we will
Someday we'll know freedom like He said we will
Today
Today
Today
Today
