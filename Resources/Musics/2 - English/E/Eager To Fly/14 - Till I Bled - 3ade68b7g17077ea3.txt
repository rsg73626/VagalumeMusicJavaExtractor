TILL I BLED

Sorry doesn't seem to cut it anymore
These half-hearted apologies
Keep bringing me back to this place
Over and over again.

With the image of abandonment
I fool even myself
But sin still lingers deep inside
Will I dig it out till I bleed and cry?

Listen to the dove sing his mournful song
In my heart I'll do the same.

There I sat with my hands on my head
I cried till I bled.
"Jesus, how could I do this to You?
To You, to You, to You?"

Listen to the dove sing his mournful song
In my heart I'll do the same.

Then He spoke words I'll never forget,
Truths I've heard a thousand times.
But I've never heard them quite like this:
"My grace is all you need."

Listen to the dove sing his mournful song
In my heart I'll do the same.
