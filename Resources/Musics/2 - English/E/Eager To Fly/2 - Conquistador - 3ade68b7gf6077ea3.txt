CONQUISTADOR

Mesmerized by gold
Interlacing silver strands
Into every fiber of life
Every fiber of life

Do we even realize?
(ooooohhhh)
Our tongues are seared
We have no taste

So trapped in this trance
With a hint to succeed
Blinded by it's fleeting value
By it's fleeting value

Everyone runs to success
Everyone runs to success

Do we even realize?
(ooooohhhh)
Our tongues are seared
We have no taste
