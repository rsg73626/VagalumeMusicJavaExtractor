MASKED BEHIND THE UNEXPLORED

Broken homes and loveless arms
Have left us empty inside
The answers, they say,
Is all about feeling good
But everything they offered
Left us torn and wanting
Left us torn and wanting,
Torn and wanting more

To see the pain
Masked behind the unexplored
Deeply scarred, we're running
But don't ask where

All the answers that we've heard
Have left us anemic and pale
And we wonder why we're empty
Trying to fill our souls
While we can't see our way around
The broken man longs deeply
To heal the broken hearts
To take our pain upon himself

To see the pain
Masked behind the unexplored
Deeply scarred, we're running
But don't ask where

To see the pain
Masked behind the unexplored
Deeply scarred, we're running
But don't ask where

Come, spirit, and heal my pain
Cause i can't take it anymore
Come, spirit, and heal my pain
Cause i can't take it anymore

When the thorns scraped against your scalp
We didn't recognize you, we didn't recognize you

When the thorns scraped against your scalp
We didn't recognize, you
But now we see
Now we see
Now we see ......
