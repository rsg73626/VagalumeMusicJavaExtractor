FAYE

Rose hips and thorns
Mar this life with beauty
Rose hips and thorns
Mar this life with beauty

(how can i let go?)
Oh, i could never let go
(these memories, so haunting)
This pain has stolen countless breathes
(how can i let go?)
Please help me live through yesterday
(these memories, so haunting)
For tomorrow seems impossible
(how can i let go?)
I feel so numb today
(these memories, so haunting)
I feel so numb today
Please help me live through my past
(how can i let go?)
For tomorrow seems impossible

My garden brings her back
For brief moments of the day
My garden brings her back
For brief moments of the day

(how can i let go?)
Oh, i could never let go
(these memories, so haunting)
This pain has stolen countless breathes
(how can i let go?)
Please help me live through yesterday
(these memories, so haunting)
For tomorrow seems impossible
(how can i let go?)
I feel so numb today
(these memories, so haunting)
I feel so numb today
Please help me live through my past
(how can i let go?)
For tomorrow seems impossible

Oh, faye
Oh, faye
