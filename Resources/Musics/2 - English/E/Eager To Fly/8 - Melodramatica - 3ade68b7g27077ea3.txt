MELODRAMATICA

Melodramatica, creating a scene to be seen
Wanting desperately to be heard
To feel more worth than a dollar bill

And they love me for the way I dress
For the way I wear my hair

Melodramatica, so controlled by the crowd's applause
Did you see the way she smiled?
The way they looked when I drove past

And they love me for the way I dress
For the way I wear my hair

And they love me, and they love me...
