BEHIND THE WATERFALLS

I am bleeding through my ears
When I hear them speak
Undercurrents deep within
That ebb at my esteem

Watch me vanish through the back door
Watch me make my quick escape
But running never works
I must face what I have feared

I am bleeding through my ears
But I'll be the one to speak
Finding healing deep within
For to live is to forgive
