SLEEPLESS

These arched ceilings are all too familiar
Gazing through white plastered walls
Consumed with thoughts
Keeping me awake from the sleep I need

And I wonder what You want sometimes
Giving me pieces of hope
And words that stir my soul
Infinite wisdom that steals my sleep

These arched ceilings are all too familiar
Gazing through white plastered walls
Consumed with thoughts
Keeping me awake from the sleep I need

And I wonder what You want sometimes
Giving me pieces of hope
And words that stir my soul
Infinite wisdom that steals my sleep
Your insight is perfect to me
Yet seemingly incomplete
And I must admit that I obsess
With every thought You share

These arched ceilings are all too familer,
All too familiar...
