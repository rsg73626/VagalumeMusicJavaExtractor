DOUBLE VISION

Somebody stop this world
I wanna get off right now
So sick of seeing double
In every life that I see

Spend half my life just being human
The other half in confessionals
Tired of this desperation
Hidden lives and secrecy

But I am no exception
Say one thing cause it sounds right
I fill in all the answers
While my actions are all left blank

And you say, "Don't stare
All day at your regret."
This life of seeing double
And looking at hypocrites

But that's not me anymore

Somebody stop this world
I wanna get off, I wanna get off
