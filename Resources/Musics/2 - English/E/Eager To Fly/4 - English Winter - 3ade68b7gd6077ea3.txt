ENGLISH WINTER

She said, "It won't go away;
It never has.
And I know what you're thinking,
That I'm crazy, or messed up somehow.

But that's how I sound to me.
That's how I sound to me.

Can't you see I've lost control?
You're the first I've ever told."

Sitting in this gray hatchback,
Distracted by this english winter.
Listening as she broke every word open,
Spilling out with every tear.

She said, "At night I lock the door.
It's out of fear.
And I can't tell you why, or I don't want to.
I'm so locked down by indecision.

Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?

Can't you see I've lost control?
You're the first I've ever told."

Sitting in this gray hatchback,
Distracted by this english winter.
Listening as she broke every word open,
Spilling out with every tear.

Solemn as we go.
Oh, it's never easy.
There's a sense of perpetual motion slowing,
As honest words articulate.

She said, "It won't go away.
It never has."
