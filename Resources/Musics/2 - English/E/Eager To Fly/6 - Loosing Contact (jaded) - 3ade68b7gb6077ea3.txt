LOOSING CONTACT (JADED)

I fear the satelite windows are closing
The longer I hang on to this pain
Help me before I loose contact
Feels like I'm running out of time

I need to heal
I need to forgive

My heart fell like a hollow tree
Blown over by the wind
I can't let this pain define who I am
Or who I will become

I need to heal
I need to forgive

Jaded
Tints every color that enters my eyes
Jaded
Though I cling to it every time
Jaded

I need to heal
I need to forgive
