ONE MORE TIME

You won't shake Your head like other people do
If I ever shared my thoughts
All the things I've done
And the trash I've swallowed
You were there all along

After all the filthy dreams I covet
After all the sin I've covered

You are there
And You forgive me
You are there, You are there

Come on just one more time
This will be the last
Come on just one more time
This will be the last
