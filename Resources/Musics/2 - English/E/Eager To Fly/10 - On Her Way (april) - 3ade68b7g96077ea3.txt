ON HER WAY (APRIL)

There is hope
But I often overlook it
All I see
Is the drab overcast predictions

There is peace
But I rarely ever feel it
I trade it away
For these dark days of no return

April is on her way
I can feel the pain of growth
Will you bring her to me
With the splash of color she fills my life

The smell of rain
Fills the humid air
And everything is turning green
And I can say
For the first time in my life
The winter in my heart is melting
