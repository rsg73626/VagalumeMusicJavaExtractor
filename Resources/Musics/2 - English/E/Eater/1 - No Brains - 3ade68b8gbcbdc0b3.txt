NO BRAINS

Well, I'm bored of watching Tv
And pickin' on the dog
So I hopped on my motorcycle
In the fog
And I ride to the all-nite
Motorway cafe
Oh God, well, I'm lookin' for a stray, yeah yeah

You ain't got no brains
(You got no brains)
You ain't got no brains
(You got no brains)
I said you, you ain't got no brains
You ain't got nothing at all

Then this girl, she walks in
And her hair's in a mess
So I buy her a cup of tea
And said: That's a nice dress
And then we talk of taxis
And underground trains
Two grown adults, but we got no brains
No brains, got no brains

You ain't got no brains
(You got no brains)
You ain't got no brains
(You got no brains)
I said you, you ain't got no brains
You ain't got nothing at all

You ain't got no brains
You ain't got no brains
You ain't got no brains
You ain't got no brains

No brains
No brains
No brains
No brains
