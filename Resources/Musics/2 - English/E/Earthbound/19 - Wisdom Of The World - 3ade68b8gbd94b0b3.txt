WISDOM OF THE WORLD

Through ice and through fire
A wilderness of stone
With dreams and desires
I have come alone
Seeking the answers
Only you could know

Show me the wisdom of the world
Tell me the secrets of the heart
And the sweet mysteries of love
Love

Come fill my eyes with visions
So that I may see
Reveal the ancient powers
Whisper them to me
Here I stand before you
Ready to receive

Show me the wisdom of the world
Tell me the secrets of the heart
And the sweet mysteries of love
Love

Does a place called paradise
Wait beyond the azure skies
Bright as day?

Look into your crystal ball
Read the future in the stars
Does it say?

Will I give my heart in vain
To a lover or a friend?
Come what may

Who to trust and where to turn
There's so much I've yet to learn
Show the way
I am down
On my knees
Begging now
Begging please

Show me the wisdom of the world
Tell me the secrets of the heart
And the sweet mysteries of love
Love
