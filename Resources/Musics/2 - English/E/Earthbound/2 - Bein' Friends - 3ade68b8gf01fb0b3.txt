BEIN' FRIENDS

When you are happy with laughter to spare
Fun is twice as fun with someone to share
When you are lonely and full of despair
Things aren't half as bad when somebody cares
Maybe now you have figured it out
That's what bein' a friend is about
When you're lookin' for a shoulder you can cry on
(Won't you think about me?)
When you're lookin' for someone you can rely on
(Don't you ever doubt me!)
I'll be there someway somehow
That's what bein' friends is about!
When you grow restless and want room to breathe
I will give you all the space that you need
And when you're ready for my company
I will come around, just call on me
Maybe now you have figured it out
That's what bein' a friend is about
When you need someone who feels the way you do
(Won't you think about me?)
Someone who can pick you up when you are blue
(Don't you ever doubt me!)
I'll be there someway somehow
That's what bein' friends is about!
I'm your friend, till the end Count on me
In the sunshine and the rain
Paradise and back again Count on me
Let me be a friend in need
Let me be a friend indeed Count on me
And if you ask me, you know that it's true
There is not a thing that I wouldn't do!
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth
That's how much I think our friendship is worth!
Maybe now you have figured it out
That's what bein' a friend is about
When there's something that you just don't understand
(Won't you think about me?)
I'll be more than here to lend a helping hand
(Don't you ever doubt me!)
I'll be there someway, somehow
That's what bein friends is about! (x2)
(Tell me all your secrets) I will swear to keep them
(Let me know your problems) I will help you solve them
(When your heart is aching) I will stop it breaking
(I will stand beside you) Be the one to guide you
That's what friends are all about!
