LOVE THEME

In a distant town, as the dark grows deep
Unfamiliar words resound, whispered and weak

Let me heal the pain, drive away despair
Lead this child whos lost his way; help him prepare

While apart, understand
I will live my life for you wherever I am

Its my greatest wish, to provide for you
Tender moments, sweetest dreams, love, warm and true

As I close my eyes, even now I see
On his face, that little child smiles just for me

If I call, if he hears
He will turn towards me, free from his fears

Shine on one dear child, one so very small
One who carries on alone, strong after all

Shine on one dear child, one so very small
One who carries on alone, strong after all
