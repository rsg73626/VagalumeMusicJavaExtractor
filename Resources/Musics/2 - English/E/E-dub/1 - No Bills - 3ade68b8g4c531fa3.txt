NO BILLS

[Verse One:] 
I met shorty at the club 
She was kinda tight 
Took me to her krib 
Sip some Moet 
Hit that ??? 
And I must admit it was kinda right 
Then she start actin' like I owed her somethin' 
I give you highs, you gave me lows 
Fair exchange, so you need to stop frontin' 
Then the bills came, you were hollerin' about 
We needed a ???, you made it, you stated 
Pay your own rent or you're getting evicted 
See that dough in the drawer, that's my change 
That four-dot-six is my range, 
Please keep your mind off my things 

[Chorus:] 
You triflin', good-for-nothin' kinda pigeon 
Silly me, thinkin' I could help a chicken 
I need a lady, who'll work to nine-to-five to help her man out 
Not a pigeon, who just lay around, just lookin' for a handout 

I can't pay your bills, I can't get your hair done 
I can't pay your rent, and I can't take care of your son 
I-don't-trick-my cash, so...pigeons do not you ask 
(For my dogs, for my dogs) 
I can't pay your bills, I can't get your hair done 
I can't pay your rent, and I can't take care of your son 
I-don't-trick-my cash, so...pigeons do not you ask 

[Verse Two:] 
You hollerin' for help now 
A year ago, wanna be on your own 
Get your own car, pay your own rent 
When it come to bills, 
You ain't tryin' to be grown 
You betta strip at the club 
Cause when it come to cash, I'm tellin' you not mine 
Need help, take this number, 1-800 welfare hotline 
Don't worry how I get mine 
Cause if I get a mil, we ain't never gonna split mine 
Ain't my fault, you had a baby by five of your guy friends 
???? around, your ??? ain't hoppin' in the back of my Benz 

[Chorus:] 
You triflin', good-for-nothin' kinda pigeon 
Silly me, thinkin' I could help a chicken 
I need a lady, who'll work to nine-to-five to help her man out 
Not a pigeon, who just lay around, just lookin' for a handout 

I can't pay your bills, I can't get your hair done 
I can't pay your rent, and I can't take care of your son 
I-don't-trick-my cash, so...pigeons do not you ask 
(For my dogs, for my dogs) 
I can't pay your bills, I can't get your hair done 
I can't pay your rent, and I can't take care of your son 
I-don't-trick-my cash, so...pigeons do not you ask 

[Bridge:] 
Let's get it straight, I'm not your husband 
Not your man, not your dad 
So when I say no,no,no, you better believe me 
It don't mean yeah,yeah,yeah 
And it won't mean yeah, yeah, yeah 
So you getting' money 
Then let's split the rest 
Be a good bird, be a good pigeon 
Fly south and get back in your nest 

[Chorus out:] 
You triflin', good-for-nothin' kinda pigeon 
Silly me, thinkin' I could help a chicken 
I need a lady, who'll work to nine-to-five to help her man out 
Not a pigeon, who just lay around, just lookin' for a handout 

I can't pay your bills, I can't get your hair done 
I can't pay your rent, and I can't take care of your son 
I-don't-trick-my cash, so...pigeons do not you ask 
(For my dogs, for my dogs) 
I can't pay your bills, I can't pay your cell phone 
I can't pay your car, no I can't help out with your home 
I-don't-trick-my cash, so...pigeons do not you as
