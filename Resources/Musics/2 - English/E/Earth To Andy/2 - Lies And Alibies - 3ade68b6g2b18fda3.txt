LIES AND ALIBIES

What you gonna do? 
Now the good luck is turning bad 
Your face is turning blue 
Trying to swallow the dream you had 

Its enough to make you fall apart (enough to make you crumble) 
Take you will and break you aching heart 

All lies and alibies 
Where were you when all of it died 

Such a tragic day 
Just as justice had turned away 
Well how you gonna play 
Knowing well that you've been betrayed 

Can't belive the depths you've sunk into (now youre so far under) 
Vanity's the royalty we bow down to 

All lies and alibies 
Where were you when all of it died 

And because of this 
Its just like you have missed 
The best part of a life thats gone astray 
Oh but is it art 
And did you do your part 
To make the most of what you got 
I know you got alot to say 
So say its sane 
And that is that 
I know your pain caught in a trap 
You cant get out get into that 
You can't belive you've fallen flat 

All lies and alibies 
Where were you when all of it died
