STILL AFTER YOU

Something inside of me
Is telling me I’ve got something I need to prove.
But I’m so full of greed
What do I need?
What am I gonna do?

I’m so hungry I could die.
I need the power you supply.
My obsession is complete.
Take it into me.

Now it’s not going down the way you want it to.	
I’m still after you.
Now your secret is out, you are forbidden fruit.
I’m still after you.
I’m still after you.

I got this evil grin,
I’m full of sin,
Ready to take you down.
I hide in the wings,
Of gods and kings
And pull you underground.

I could live a million years,
Put away my mortal fears.
My obsession is complete.
Need to taste immortality,
Take it into me.

Now it’s not going down the way you want it to. (Take what I want)	
I’m still after you.
Now you secret is out, you are forbidden fruit. (Get what I need)	
I’m still after you. (x3)


I’m so hungry I could die. (I could die)	
I need the power you supply.
My obsession is complete.
Take it into me.

Now it’s not going down the way you want it to. (Take what I want)	
I’m still after you.
Now you secret is out, you are forbidden fruit. (Get what I need)	
I’m still after you.
Now it’s not going down the way you want it to.
I’m still after you. (x3)

I’m still after you.
