INFIDEL

Dont get stuck in your head 
Lost and lonely untill the bitter end 
Just forget what you said 
And all the good inside can show itself again 

Who are you now 
Well its just the season changing on you 
So you look good again 
You are so proud In a world of universal chaos,you watch the leaves hit the ground 

Let'em fall 
Separate yourself 
Forget it all 
Just be glad you've got your health 

You're not the only sad and lonely 
Infidel 
Even though you feel like living hell 

All the evidence in Fingers pointing into the ugly sin 
Walking hard on the pins 
With out a thought to where the needles been 

Who are you now 
Well it's just the season changing on you 
So you look good again 
You are so proud 
In a world of universal chaos,you watch the leaves hit the ground 

Let'em fall 
Separate yourself 
Forget it all 
Just be glad you've got your health 

You're not the only sad and lonely 
Infidel 
Even though you feel like living hell 

And you think its going well 
Only time will tell what you are gonna do about the anger coming through the words you use 


Let'em fall 
Separate yourself 
Forget it all 
Just be glad you've got your health 

You're not the only sad and lonely 
Your not the only sad and lonely 
Your not the only sad and lonely...Infidel
