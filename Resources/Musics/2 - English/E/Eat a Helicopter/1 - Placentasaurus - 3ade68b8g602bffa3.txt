PLACENTASAURUS

I still remember everything she said
With her last breath she told me something
If peace can still be found I don't understand what she means

Her scent still lingers in my skin
Her taste still lingers in my mouth

She changed my life!

I gut her open wide and hung her from the sky
She will never leave and will never be coming home

As the scalpel ground against her bone
I tore at her corpse
Now there's nothing left but the loving memory of her face

The smell of rot and decay embedded in my skin!
