Can't you see? Don't you see? It's not true
It was only just to keep us together
This is it, that was it, your last chance
Don't say I didn't warn you in advance

Can't you see? Don't you see? It's not true
It was only just to keep us together
This is it, that was it, your last chance
Don't say I didn't warn you in advance

How can you say you care?
Baby, you don't even know if I'm not there
Baby, if your life's just a love affair
Count me out

How can you say you care?
Baby, you don't even know if I'm not there
Baby, if your life's just a love affair
Count me out

Die, die
Die, die
Die, die
Die, die

Can't you see? Don't you see? It's not true
It was only just to keep us together
This is it, that was it, your last chance
Don't say I didn't warn you in advance
