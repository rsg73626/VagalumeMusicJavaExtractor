FULL CIRCLE

Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
Look at you now
Got my eyes on you, got my eyes on you
It's a feeling, a fixation, me plus you

Can't you wait and see, can't you wait and see?
Give it a chance
Can't you wait and see, can't you wait and see?
I know you and you know you need me so well

You heard me in the locker room
I said that we would be history
Not sure you're ready, it's too soon
Wait for me

It could all come crashing down
In a hope, you'll come around
Even though we're meant to be
Why don't you need me?

Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
Look at you now
Got my eyes on you, got my eyes on you
It's a feeling, a fixation, me plus you

Can't you wait and see, can't you wait and see?
Give it a chance
Can't you wait and see, can't you wait and see?
I know you and you know me so well

You heard me in the locker room
I said that we would be history
Not sure you're ready, it's too soon
Wait for me

And I know we're falling down
We would hope you'll come around
Even though we're meant to be
It's so hard on me

It could all come crashing down
In a hope, you'll come around
Even though we're meant to be
Why don't you need me?

One day you'll be

Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
We would hope you'll come around
I said that we would be history
It's a feeling, a fixation, me
Meant to be, why don't you need me?

Look at you now, got my eyes on you
Got my eyes on you
We would hope you'll come around
I said that we would be history
It's a feeling, a fixation, me
Meant to be, why don't you need me?
