MONEY

Money, get away.
Get a good job with good pay and youre okay.
Money, its a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think Ill buy me a football team.

Money, get back.
Im all right jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, its a hit.
Dont give me that do goody good bullshit.
Im in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a lear jet.

[sung in an ominous dancehall chant]

Money will make a good man bad - yah yah
Money will make 'nuff man bad - yah yah
money will make bredren and bredren go to war

if you no careful it will make you lose your mind, yas!

If you worship it, destined fi a fall
very addictive, watch, be selective,
nuh bodda sell yuh soul, just fear de money

Nevah remember when dem used to beg a dollah
Nevah remember when dem used to dead fi hungah
now dat dem get rich, dem gwan like big timah

Bwoy ya cyan rich today, and broke tomorruh
Don't you know dat's the way life go? Yes!

Money a money and friend a friend

Dem a rush in and a kill fi de dollah
Fi de love of money man a kill 'em owna brodda

Powah is money, money is powah

ghetto youth, alla man - be a beggah no!
Don't bodda mix up inna de bwoy dem suttin'
Boy if want trouble will get it, 'pon de double
'Pon de paypah chase, boy na watch no face
When every lickle 'ting dem want fi done de place

Well well well - well...

Money will make a good man bad - yah yah yah yas
Money will make 'nuff man bad - yah yah yah yas

Money, its a crime.
Share it fairly but dont take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a raise its no surprise that theyre
Giving none away.

Huhuh! I was in the right!
Yes, absolutely in the right!

You was definitely in the right. that geezer was cruising for a
Bruising!

Why does anyone do anything?

Why he wasnt coming up on freely, after I was yelling and
Screaming and telling him why he wasnt coming up on freely
