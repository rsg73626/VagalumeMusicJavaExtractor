LET DOWN

Transport, motorways and tramlines,
Starting and then stopping,
Taking off and landing,
The emptiest of feelings,
Disappointing creep on, clinning onto bottles,
And when it comes it's so, so, disappointing.

Let down and hanging around,
Crushed like a bug in the ground.
Let down and hanging around.

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going,
Don't get sentimental,it always ends up drivel
One day, i'm going to grow wings,
A chemical reaction,
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around,
Crushed like a bug in the ground.
Let down and hanging around.

Let down and hanging...
Let down and hanging...
Let down and hanging...

You know, you know where you are with,
You know where you are with,
Floor collapses, flotting, bouncing back
And one day, i am going to grow wings,
A chemical reaction, [you know where you are,]
Hysterical and useless [you know where you are,]
Hysterical and [you know where you are,]

Let down and hanging around,
Crushed like a bug in the ground.
Let down and hanging around.
