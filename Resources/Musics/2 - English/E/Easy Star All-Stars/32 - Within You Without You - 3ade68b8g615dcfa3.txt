WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU

"We were talking...
about the space between us all
and the people
who hide themselves behind a wall
of illusion
never glimpse the truth
when it's far too late...
when they pass away.....

We were talking about the love we all could share
when we find it...
to try our best to hold it there
(with our love)
With our love we could save the world,
If they only knew.......

Try to realise its all within yourself
no one else can make you change,
And to see you're really only very small
and life goes on within you
and without you.

*

We were talking
about the love thats gone so cold
And the people
who gain the world and lose their soul
they dont know
they cant see..
Are you one of them?...

When you've seen beyond yourself
then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
we're all one and life goes on within you and without you."
