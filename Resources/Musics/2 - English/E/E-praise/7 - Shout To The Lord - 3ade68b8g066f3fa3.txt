SHOUT TO THE LORD

My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord, there is none like You
All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of your might love.

My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You.

Shout to the Lord
All the earth, let us sing
Power and majesty
Praise to the King.
Mountains bow down
And the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name.

I sing for joy
At the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You
Forever I'll stand.
Nothing compares 
To the promise I have in You.
