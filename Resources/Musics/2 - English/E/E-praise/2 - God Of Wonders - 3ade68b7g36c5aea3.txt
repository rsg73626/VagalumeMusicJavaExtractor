GOD OF WONDERS

Lord of Heaven and Earth
Lord of all creation
Lord of Heaven and Earth

Lord of all creation
Of the water, earth and sky
The Heavens are your Tabernacle
Glory To the Lord on high

God of wonders
Beyond our galaxy
You are holy, holy
The universe
Declares your majesty
You are holy, holy

Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light
And when I stumble into darkness
I will call your name by night

God of wonders
Beyond our galaxy
You are holy, holy
The universe
Declares your majesty
You are holy, holy

Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth

Holy, holy
Holy, holy

God of wonders
Beyond our galaxy
You are holy, holy

Precious Lord,
Reveal your heart to me
Father hold me, hold me

The Universe 
Declares your majesty
You are Holy, Holy
Holy, Holy

Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth
