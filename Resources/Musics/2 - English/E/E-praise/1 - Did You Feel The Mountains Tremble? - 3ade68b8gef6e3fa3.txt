DID YOU FEEL THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE?

Did you feel the mountains tremble?
Did you hear the oceans roar?
When the people rose to sing of Jesus Christ the risen one.
Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar?
When the lost began to sing of Jesus Christ the saving one.

And we can see that God you're moving
A mighty river through the nations.
When young and old return to Jesus.
Fling wide you heavenly gates!
Prepare the way of the risen Lord! 

Open up the doors
Let the music play
Let the streets resound with singing
Songs that bring Your hope
And the songs that bring Your joy
Dance Yusser Dance
Upon injustice

Do you feel the darkness tremble?
When all the saints join in one song.
And all the streams flow in one river
To wash away our brokenness

And we see that God you're moving
A time of jubilee is coming
When young and old return to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates!
Prepare the way of the risen Lord!

Open up the doors
Let the music play

Songs that bring Your hope
And the songs that bring Your joy
