SLEEPING IN MY HEAD

Youâ€™ve been, youâ€™ve been sleeping in my head
Tossing and turning in my bed
Iâ€™ve been thinking I really like the thought that
Youâ€™ve been, youâ€™ve been sleeping in my head
Youâ€™re all that Iâ€™ve ever wanted
Youâ€™ve been in my head

Iâ€™m hooked on you, do anything you want me to
Although youâ€™re just a fantasy
I wanna make this dream come true
I know youâ€™ll never let me down
Cause in my mind youâ€™ve always been around
Itâ€™s only you I see, cause when I close my eyes
Youâ€™re right in front of me

Girl you look just like a beauty queen
Straight out the pages of a magazine
The way you wear you hair, you make me stare
The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
I just fell in love and I couldnâ€™t hide
What I have instore for you, donâ€™t let me down
Say you want me to

If I was to take you on a ride
Take a journey into paradise
Would it change the way I feel
Or would it make my love for real
Everytime I close my eyes I get this feeling deep inside
That I donâ€™t want to lose, got to face the truth
I only know I need you in my life
