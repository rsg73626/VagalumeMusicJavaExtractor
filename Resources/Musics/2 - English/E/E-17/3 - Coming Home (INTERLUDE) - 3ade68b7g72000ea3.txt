COMING HOME (INTERLUDE)

Iâ€™m coming home, coming home

Everybodyâ€™s got their loves, to live as they will find
But for me itâ€™s just ordinary day
Confided in my mind, within a certain space
I know that time is moving on
Canâ€™t help but think that youâ€™ll be gone

After all that weâ€™ve been through
I canâ€™t believe the time has come
When Iâ€™ll be coming back to you

Iâ€™m coming home, coming home
