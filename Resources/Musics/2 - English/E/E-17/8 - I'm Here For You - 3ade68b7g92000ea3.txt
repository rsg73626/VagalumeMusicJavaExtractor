I'M HERE FOR YOU

Just when you feel nothing is real anymore
Along comes a sign that changes your mind and you want
To do what is right for once in your life make it work
But the harder it gets you make such a mess and it hurts

When you feel weak and all alone and it seems you canâ€™t go on
Just when you think of turning back cause youâ€™ve got so far to go
If ever you need a friend just someone to hold again
Iâ€™m here for you

Just when you hope youâ€™ve got what it takes to survive
You feel like you need someone elseâ€™s advice
You wait for the day you constantly pray that it comes
The day when you see your life turn around just for once

I know the times are hard for you
Iâ€™ll be the friend you can turn to
I will be there when youâ€™re feeling scared
