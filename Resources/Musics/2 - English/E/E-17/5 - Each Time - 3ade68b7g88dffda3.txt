EACH TIME

Have you heard of the saying for those who are playing
You donâ€™t know what youâ€™ve got till itâ€™s gone
Well that was my calling, I knew I was falling
Into something that would be so wrong

But I caught hold of myself and changed for the better
I canâ€™t get you out of my mind
Cause something inside made me realise you were fine

Each time when weâ€™re alone, I guess I didnâ€™t know
How far we were apart, shouldâ€™ve spoken to my heart
I guess I didnâ€™t know that each time youâ€™d go away Iâ€™d cry
I canâ€™t take all these good-byes

I know from this feeling, deep inside thereâ€™s healing
I know that Iâ€™m in control
Every day I am yearning, this love I feel burning
Burning right through my soul

So letâ€™s make a start of something that cannot be broken
The mould is so strong, treat this love as a child
That grows into something worthwhile

Deep, love so deep, deep love so deep, yeah
I canâ€™t take all these good-byes
Faithfully I will be, you will see, please believe me
I canâ€™t take all these good-byes

All the time we were alone
Guess I shouldâ€™ve really know
