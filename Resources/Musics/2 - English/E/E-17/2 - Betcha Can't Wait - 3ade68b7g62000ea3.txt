BETCHA CAN'T WAIT

Itâ€™s two oâ€™clock in the morning babe
I wanna call but I know itâ€™s late
But you left message on the phone to get back to you
So Iâ€™m calling you up, cause Iâ€™m feeling kinda lonely
And just for tonight you can be my one and only
So when you come round, we will get down
If it feels right we can do it all night
Betcha canâ€™t wait

Betcha canâ€™t wait, betcha canâ€™t stop
Thinking â€˜bout my love rock, do I hear the penny drop
Baby come on, betcha canâ€™t wait
Betcha wanna stay, now I wanna play
Girl I gotta hundred ways, really wanna make your day
Letâ€™s get it on, betcha canâ€™t wait

Try to picture what youâ€™re wearing now
Donâ€™t disappoint me donâ€™t you let me down
The thought of you has gotta hold on me
Iâ€™m gonna touch you in the right spot baby
Feed you my love it will drive you crazy
Betcha canâ€™t wait, baby itâ€™s all good

Betcha canâ€™t wait, betcha canâ€™t stop
Canâ€™t stop thinking â€˜bout my love rock, baby come on
No not tonight, stay here with me â€“ I want you baby
Betcha canâ€™t wait, betcha canâ€™t stop
Canâ€™t stop thinking â€˜bout my love rock, baby come on
