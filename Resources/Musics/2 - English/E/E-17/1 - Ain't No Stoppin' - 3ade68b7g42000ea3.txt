AIN'T NO STOPPIN'

Ainâ€™t no stoppinâ€™ weâ€™re gonna keep on rockinâ€™
Thereâ€™s no stoppinâ€™ us

Used to be so blind, but now I see
What you were doing, doing to me
Trying to take my money, trying to take my soul
Trying to take my future, trying to take control

You did us wrong, but we steyed strong
Weâ€™re gonna do it all over again, itâ€™s a fact we are back

Now weâ€™ve just begun, doing our own thing
Weâ€™re here to tell you that there ainâ€™t no stoppinâ€™
E-1-7 is about to be dropping
Itâ€™s on and on, cause Iâ€™ve got my future
