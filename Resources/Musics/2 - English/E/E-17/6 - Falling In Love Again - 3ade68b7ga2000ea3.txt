FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN

Falling in love again I guess Iâ€™m falling, falling 
Falling in love again this time with you, with you
Falling in love again I guess Iâ€™m falling, falling
I guess Iâ€™m falling in love with you

Just like the first time when I saw your pretty face
Something about you, something I could not explain
Gave me this feeling I know I have felt before
Gave me this feeling, something I could not ignore

(ooh) I wanna get something started
(aah) But I donâ€™t even know your name
(ooh) I think Iâ€™m falling
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) Iâ€™m falling

I canâ€™t help thinking that you and I were meant to be
But you never imagined what you really mean to me
If you love was frozen Iâ€™ll turn up your body heat
Keep it one the down low, anywhere you wanna go
We can take it nice and slow

Could it be that Iâ€™m falling in love again
Could it be that Iâ€™m falling in love
Never thought that this feeling would came again
