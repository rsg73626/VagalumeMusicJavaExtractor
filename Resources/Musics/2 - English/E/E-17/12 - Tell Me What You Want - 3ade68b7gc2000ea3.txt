TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT

Tell me baby, baby

Thought I had the right one, suddenly you came along
You were so fine, so I had to choose
It had to be a must, so for us, thereâ€™s no time to lose

Girl you know Iâ€™m really down for you
So if you feel it too
Tell me baby, baby
I just wanna spend my life with you
So if you want it too I can give you all that you need

Tell me baby, baby, baby tell me what you want
And I will give you what you need
Baby, baby, baby all I wanna do
Is give my love to you babe

There is nothing that Iâ€™d rather do
Than be spendig all my time with you
You are so fine, there â€˜s no doubt
It had to be a must, so for us, thereâ€™s no time to lose

Baby canâ€™t we get it on tonight, so if it feels alright
Tell me baby, baby
All I wanna do is satisfy, just you and I
I can give you all that you need

What you want, baby Iâ€™ve got it
