WHATEVER YOU NEED

Whatever you need baby

Baby you donâ€™t ever have to be afraid
Surrender to me for anything that you want
Cause youâ€™re my lady and you donâ€™t even need to go to work
Cause I got your act in so many ways

Weâ€™ll spend some time
Relax a while and we wonâ€™t think of no one else
Iâ€™ll put you before myself
Iâ€™ll never find another girl like you
Who can love me like you do
So I can give my love to you

Whatever you need baby (whatever you need baby)
To keep you satisfied
Whatever it takes to keep you smiling
Whatever you need baby
To keep you by my side
Whatever it takes to keep you smiling

Youâ€™re the kind of lady
Who knows just what she wants
Said youâ€™re strong in a sexy kind of way
You donâ€™t care about those things
Fancy cars and diamond rings
