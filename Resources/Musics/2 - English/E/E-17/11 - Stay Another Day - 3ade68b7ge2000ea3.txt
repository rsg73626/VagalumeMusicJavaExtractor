STAY ANOTHER DAY

(Stay now x2)
Baby if youæŠ³e got to go away,
DonæŠ° think I could take the pain
(Stay now x2)
WonæŠ° you stay another day
(Stay now x4)
Oh donæŠ° leave me alone like this
DonæŠ° you say itæŠ¯ the final kiss
(Stay now x2)
Wont you stay another day
(Stay now, donæŠ° you know?)

DonæŠ° you know weæŠ³e come to far now
Just to go, and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love, was gonnato be, here to stay
IæŠ³e only just began to know you
All I can say, is wonæŠ° you stay just one more day

(Stay now x2)

(Stay now x2)
Wont you stay another day

I touch your face while you are sleeping
And hold your hand, donæŠ° understand whatæŠ¯ going on
Good times we had returned to haunt me
Though itæŠ¯ for you, all that I do seems to be wrong
