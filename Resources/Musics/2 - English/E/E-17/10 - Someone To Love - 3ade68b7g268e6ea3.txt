SOMEONE TO LOVE

First thing in the morning when you just arose 
your eyes still closed, 
your getting up, your feeling down,
maybe it's cause your beds creased on one side, 
you can't hide your face from smiling,
while your heart wears a frown
always moving on,
no place to call home,
living alone why should it have to be this way,

we all need someone to love, (someone to love)
we all need someone to love, 
holding and kissing you
when you go missing you 
keeping you warm through the cold of the night 
we all need someone to love

you run and you hide, 
while your hurting inside from memories 
you can't get away from the pain in your heart
you toss and you turn 
you see all you member was a childhood dream 
can't keep it together while your world fall apart

your just like them
and they don't agree,
living alone, 
why does this have to be this way

we all need someone to love, (someone to love)
we all need someone to love, 
holding and kissing you,
when you go missing you, 
keeping you warm through the cold of the night, 
we all need someone to love

holding and kissing you,
when you go missing you, 
keeping you warm through the cold of the night, 
and to be your companion is so understanding,
you've every need to be alright

we all need someone to love, 
we all need someone to love,
we all need someone to love,
we all need someone to love,
we all need someone to love,
we all need someone to love,

we all need someone to love, (someone to love)
we all need someone to love, 
holding and kissing you,
when you go missing you, 
keeping you warm through the cold of the night, 
we all need someone to love

we all need someone to love, (to fade)
