I MISS YOU

We used to talk, laugh a lot girl
What happened to those days
Did they all just fade away
Holding you in my arms
Made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
Whatâ€™s wrong? Baby I need to know

But now is the day I wish you could come back to make us true
But youâ€™re long gone away, now Iâ€™m missing you
Iâ€™m missing you baby, I miss you
Iâ€™m talking to you baby, I miss you

I thought youâ€™d be with me forever
But I guess someone took my place
Took the place of me loving you
Making love to you all through the night
I wish you were still here
So I could see your pretty face again
Please come back and rescue me
From all this pain and misery

Thereâ€™s nothing I wouldnâ€™t do to get back next to you
Iâ€™m missing you every day (Iâ€™m missing you every day)
I just canâ€™t go on this way (I just canâ€™t go on this way)
Come back to me, Iâ€™m begging you please
Iâ€™m down on my knees, Iâ€™m begging you please
