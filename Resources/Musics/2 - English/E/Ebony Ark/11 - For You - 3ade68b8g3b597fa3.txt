FOR YOU

I can only say goodbye
In my dreams when you appear
I've lost my best friend
My partner of tears
It's our farewell
My guardian has gone

Feeling you so close tonight
I only wish you can enjoy
a world with no lies
where Sun shines just for you
where the Moon now embraces your soul

No one to share with
There's no one to lead me
Feeling alone is being dead
Why did you leave me?
Say why you and not me
I'm the one who has buried my dreams

Here everything is just memories of you
I'm alive but my soul died with you...

No one to share with...

No one to share with
This song I have written
Hear my voice, won't be memories apart
Who will I care for?
Together, sleepless
It has no sense now if you are not here
