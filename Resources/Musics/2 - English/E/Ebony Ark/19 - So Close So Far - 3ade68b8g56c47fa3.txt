SO CLOSE SO FAR

Never could you let me near your heart 
I am not ashamed to love you 
Hold me tight 
I'll hold you close to me 
Choose tonight 

Can't you look into my eyes 
and see the pain I'm feeling? 
I wonder if you have a heart 
I tried my best but 
I was not enough 

(So close so far...) 
Why is the dream of your cold beauty so far? 
(Can feel so far...) 
Why I have written all these love words for us? 
(So close so far...) 
Why are you near and I can feel you so far? 
(Can feel so far...) 
It must be only my fault 

To you, my tears mean nothing 
Can't you see? 
The distance here is miles between us 
I can't cope 
I'll kiss you with my glance 
And tears will rise 

Can't you look into my eyes 
and see the pain I'm feeling? 
Have you ever cared for me? 
I tried my best with you 
I'm sorry, It was not enough 

(So close so far...) 
Why is the dream of your cold beauty so far? 
(Can feel so far...) 
Why I have written all these love words for us? 
(So close so far...) 
Why are you near and I can feel you so far? 
(Can feel so far...) 
Why did I sacrifice myself?
