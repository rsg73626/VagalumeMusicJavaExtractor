TRUE FRIENDSHIP NEVER DIES

Please believe in me
believe in me now
as I've believe in you
for so many years we have been friends

Always being around
Always being near
Friendship that has died
has never been the real one

All that we've lived through
And all that we've planned
Are our lives and I don't
Don't wanna change them and
All that we've lived through
And all that we've planned
Is in my mind and I
Will be there for you

There is nothing here
that you'd never do
You make me see sunshine
through the rain and the winter days too

Never being unkind
Never away
Friendship that has died
has never been the real one
