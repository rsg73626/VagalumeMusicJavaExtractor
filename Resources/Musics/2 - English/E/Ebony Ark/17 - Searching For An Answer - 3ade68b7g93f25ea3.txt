SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER

Sometimes words confuse our minds
Sometimes the tears of life try to hide
Leaving memories behind
You wanna live your life with no more fears

In these days of lies and envy
They don't let be free
That's the price

IF YOU WANNA FEEL
AND YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER
IF YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW CAN YOU FADE THE PAST
IF YOU WANNA FEEL
AND YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT TIME ALL PAIN HEALS

Need time to clear out your mind
Still everuthing looks so
So confuse
Trying to scape from all mistakes
And run away from all
The scars deep inside
