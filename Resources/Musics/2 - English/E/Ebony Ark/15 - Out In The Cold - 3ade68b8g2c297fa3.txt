OUT IN THE COLD

There's no ache inside
the cold emptiness surrounds it
stone heart, no feelings now
that must be, now, the only answer

There's no way out from here
I can not see the sun again
the stormy clouds that rule my life
will prevail

Frozen are the days that run my life
The desperation I can feel
Holding on to dreams that can't come back
There's no way to hide from what's real

In my hollow life
I feel now my conscience must return
flesh heart, feelings now
pain is back, with it must come the answer

Now there's a way from here
I can start seeing the sun again
the stormy clouds will soon go by
won't return?
