WHEN THE CITY IS QUIET

When the night covers us
City's quiet
I can. can hear a voice from the dark
I can't even keep out
Is this a moan from me...?
No please!
No more suffering!
Destiny is calling me now
Pulse gets faster at each moment
Shall I die?
I'll decide
I'm afraid of the unknown
Of unseen

Maybe it's what I believe
Something's killing
Something's killing me fast deep inside
Nightmares emerging here
Future is uncertain,
hidden is my ending
Will my soul return to me?
Agony is killing me
Shall I die?
I'll decide
No more hopes just in vain
I've decided

I'll keep fighting
I don't want to die
Sickness's in my mind but
It hurts me
I'll keep fighting
Let me try
Don't wanna to die!
