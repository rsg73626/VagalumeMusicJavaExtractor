IF ONLY

They say you're hidden in 
the darkness but you see 
Circle's confusion 
Why I must kneel to you? 
Is there hope after hope? 
No, I'm asking for your name 

Praying in vain 
What does salvation mean? 
Dust to dust 
Womb to tomb 
Ain't no Gift of God? 
No...! 

If only the suffering of children 
If only the wars 'd never been 
If only the lies never blind us 
I'm waiting for answers still 

The only certainly 
is ending in a tomb 
heading for nowhere 
How can we keep the faith? 
if we keep falling down 
falling down one by one 

Forever lost 
Forsaken for what I am 
Dust to dust 
Womb to tomb 
Ain't no Gift of God? 
No...!
