THORN OF ICE

In silence
While my soul is empty again
I feel your thorn with hate and love
Your shadow embrace my mind
Even my tears are dried

Why, why I'm feeling lost and
Why I feel ashamed
I, I would like to die to live in a dream
I feel the freezing breath
The cold inside me hurt
Deep within and I cannot bear this fear

And I close my eyes
No healing hand for me
This thorn of ice
Still makes me cry
Take a look at my shattered heart
I'm feeling nothing but a silent cry

In silence
While my soul is empty again
I feel your thorn with hate and love
Your shadow embrace my mind
Even my tear are dried

Why, why I'm feeling lost and
Why I feel ashamed
I, I would like to die to live in a dream
I feel the freezing breath
The cold inside me hurt
Deep within and I cannot bear this fear

And I close my eyes
No healing hand for me
This thorn of ice
Still makes me cry
Take a look at my shattered heart
I'm feeling nothing but a silent cry
