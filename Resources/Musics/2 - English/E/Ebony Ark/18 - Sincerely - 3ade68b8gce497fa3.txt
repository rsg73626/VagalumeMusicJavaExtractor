SINCERELY

Thinking of you
is clarity
I need to confess you
that I've never loved as I love you now
Many sleepless nights
Till you're in my life

I'm so sorry if I
If I've hurt you
Now clouds at last have gone
Sometimes words can't explain
what I am feeling
Many sleepless nights
But you're now with me

If I tell you sincerely
That my love is pure
Don't ask 'bout the past
Please just believe
I've been in darkness for so long...
Thought things have been going wrong
You've been always standing strong
Never, no one has made me feel
So complete
