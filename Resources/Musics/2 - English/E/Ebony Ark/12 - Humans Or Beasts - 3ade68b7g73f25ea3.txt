HUMANS OR BEASTS

In the line of evolution
Something made stand apart from
The beasts surrounding us
Made us different

We have the chance to use
This world to serve our plans
The ability to hate and love
To choose the way that we live our lives

This world must change
We carry the slab of indifference
Time to replace
Time to recover
The faith

Are we humans or beasts...?

HUMANKIND
LIE AND HATE
STEAL AND MURDER ONE
OUR GREED
WILL KILL OUR PLANET
CAN'T MAKE OUT
IF WE ARE BEASTS

That man's not white he must die
And doesn't believe in my God
He must pay for his sins
We're not equal

We have no rules at all
No mind no sell our friends
Killing them, ashamed and tourtured them
At whatever cost
And break all the laws
