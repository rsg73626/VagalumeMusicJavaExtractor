REDEMPTION

Is not the first time
Another deception has begun
I was you, you were me once
Won't miss the things I left behind

No more lies frozen in time
Please don't try to stay by my side
I can sleep
I can sleep at last

There's no redemption
I've fallen
I've fallen down
But now I'm glad that
I'm not with you
We've all been left and
We've broken
We have the choice
It's time to wake up
Open your eyes

All these years dying
Trapped in a place where I can't escape
I am the one you despise
I was lost inside your world

No more lies frozen in time
Please don't try to stay by my side
I was weak
I was weak in madness
