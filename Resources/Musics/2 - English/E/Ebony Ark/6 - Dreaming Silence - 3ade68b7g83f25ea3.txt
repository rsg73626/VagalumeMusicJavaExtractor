DREAMING SILENCE

Darkness is closing
Feeling lost and frightened
Thinking where my life has gone
I feel my mind is going to
Trap my soul
Let go to eternity

Silence is nearing
Whispers sound so deafening
I dont belong here anymore
My life is passing by
Infront of my eyes
Take the path
Let your soul
Guide you to the light

I'm dreaming silence
The cold will take me from my tears
Emptiness will feel my world
To darkness
The end of sorrow
And close my eyes to see no more
One last feeling in my mind
To rest in peace

Dreaming... silence... ah ah...
Dreaming... ah ah...

Sadness is growing
Loved ones I remember
I wont be there for them no more
One final thought for those
I left behind
Living on
Let their souls
Guide them through their lives

I'm dreaming silence
The cold will take me from my tears
Emptiness will feel my world
To darkness
The end of sorrow
And close my eyes to see no more
One last feeling in my mind
To rest in...
One last feeling in my mind
To rest in peace
