ENDLESS ROAD

I've been running all my life 
Always lost in dreams 
Time goes by... 
Screams are growing 
and night is falling 
Beware... the darkness 

All I have wanted never is 
My world is empty just like me 
I won't look back at my own past 
I'm living a lie 

Time is neverending 
Time makes me sigh 
Time... I can never find out why it flies 

There's no exit 
I can't breath 
There's no hope for me 
Trust no one 
Crazy thoughts and 
disturbed confessions 
drives me insane... 
The end is near... 

All I have wanted never is 
My world is empty just like me 
I won't look back at my own past 
I'm living a lie
