NIGHT'S COLD SYMPHONY

If you can't hear my screams
Who am I to pray for mankind?
Feel... Misery

In the silence of fields
Dance of whispers are claiming for their suffering lifes
Lonely tears
Lonely tears falling weak deep inside
Under a burning sky

Brightness will turn in darkness
The stream will end in silence
While my soul feels the human pain

The Night's Cold Symphony
Fall down in velvet ground
The Night's Cold Symphony
This is our fate

...Their lifes passed before their eyes closed...

Smile of death looks within
Our fears and our sins
And his madness lead to mankind grave
Nobody can bring back
The dream of eternal life
Now we sail in a sea of hate!

If you can't hear my screams
Who am I to pray for mankind?
Feel... Misery

In our cold symphony
Freezing flames cover our illusions in the earth
Lonely tears
Lonely tears falling weak deep inside
Under a burning sky

Brightness will turn in darkness
The stream will end in silence
While my soul feels the human pain

The Night's Cold Symphony
Fall down in velvet ground
The Night's Cold Symphony
This is our fate
