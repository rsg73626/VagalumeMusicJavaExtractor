BALL AND CHAIN

I can feel you're here
Hear your voice
Singing that fatefull song
I can feel your hands close to me
like sun and earth at dawn

Why did you leave here?
Why your voice seem so sad and lost?
Why did you leave here?
Why come back?
Why this ghost from the past?

One day you said to me "I have to go"
Then you kissed me and disappeared through the fog
If only that letter had no arrived
And this day was the last I saw you alive

While I was in hell
Every night in my dreams
I heard your sweet voice
Awakening my hopes to return

Rain can't clean my tears
and nobody but you can feel my pain
My life is an endless nightmare

I have come to save you
Take my hand
Leave this life behind

I dont want to die
Take my hand
Leave this life behind

I don't want to die
Stay away from me
Let me forgive

(Surrender to me)

Why did u have to go one day?
If only you hadn't gone to this stupid war
I still loving you so much
But you can't say this to me
So take you ball and chain
Get out of here
Leave me alone...
