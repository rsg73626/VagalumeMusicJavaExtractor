DEAD MEN'S LIVES

I hear voices in my mind
Don't know if these moans are real or not
I'm fast asleep,
Here's where my worst nightmare begins

I can't believe my eyes
I don't have the courage to ask
How can you be here?
I've lost you many years ago
'Cause your disease

They all lie to me
Made me believe in your death
They all deceived me
But I didn't trust them

ALL DEAD MEN'S LIVES
ARE IN OUR MEMORIES
ALL DEAD MEN'S LIVES ARE NOT BURIED
ALL DEAD MEN'S LIVES
ARE IN OUR MEMORIES
EVEN DEAD MEN CAN CRY

I can't understand
All things in my mind are so astray
I was asleep
Disillution on me

In this shadowy night
I remember your voice and your sense
You'll be never here
I've lost you many year ago
'Cause your disease

They all lie to me
Made me believe in your death
Now I must trust them
Hope's just in vain
