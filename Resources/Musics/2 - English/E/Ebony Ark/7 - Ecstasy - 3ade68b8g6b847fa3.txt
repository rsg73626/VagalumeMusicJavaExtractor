ECSTASY

I'm lost in my hidden fantasies 
Carried by my perverse longings 
I feel anxiety 
Bring me your ecstasy and feel 
my moist skin 

Wax, falling down like tears 
Your curves are all I need 
Surrender purity 
And give in... 

Come, rip my soul 
My aching fears 
There's no time left 
Just bite my lips 
Don't wanna be alone right now... 

We melted to each other's arms 
and slurped on each 
others sharp charms 
I'm losing sanity 
Bring me your ecstasy and aim 
Don't be ashamed 

Wax, falling down like tears 
Your curves are all I need 
Surrender purity 
And give in... 

Come, rip my soul 
My aching fears 
There's no time left 
Just bite my lips 
Don't wanna be alone right now... 

I can't resist the heat in me 
the heat in me. 
No, I can't deal 
I just wanna feel 
eroticism and endless warmth 
Wanna make you crawl and 
make you explode!
