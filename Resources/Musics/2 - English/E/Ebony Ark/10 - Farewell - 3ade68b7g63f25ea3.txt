FAREWELL

In the magic path
Of your emotions
You always sowed The seed of lowlines
The seed grew in my heart
And never can I now
Forget the tree that grew in my soul

Why did you allowed me
Into the darkness
Now I'm a fallen leaf
(From) the tree of my memories
the wind drags me
And it stole our tears and smiles
To stick them eternally

in our tormented souls

Don't take me away
don't you drag me
To the River of Farewell
Inside me there's still some love
That will let me see the light

When I cannot
Hear your whisper
I think of the farewell
When I can feel
Your skin arround me
Reminds me of our time

I met a wise man once
And this is what he said:
Don't fear the River of Farewell
Because it will guide
you through this otherwise
senseless thing called life
