DIE LAST

Die Last

Welcome you up there above,
You´ve travelled long through space,
But you will be dissapointed
With us the human race

Welcome you up there above,
On our planet, that you respect.
But the poisonous air down here
Is not what you expect

The genes in the embryo,
they are a second me
Look into my face, a cripple,
is there for all to see

The air here upon our earth,
Toxic clean and sulphur hot,
Our poor groans are full of passion,
Day and night it´s our lot.
