ELECTROCUTION

Electrocution

Soot, skin, your brain
Succumb to your destiny
And pain!

Soot, skin, your face
And body cramps suddenly
No grace.

Kill, kill, kill, electrocy!
electrocutes your disagree

Heat, blood, liquid eyes
The current drags you to
Paradise.

Heat, blood, your wounds
A lightning in your head
Your yell resounds.

Corpse, hell, lost fight
Uncontrolled reality
Took your life.
