FULL OF DECAY

Full Of Decay

Love and fear, delight and scorn
Perish but are soon reborn
Inca gold is melted down
And becomes a virginÂ´s crown

Wasted being, full of decay
Face yourself and lose your way
Wasted being, full of decay
Change yourself, conventions fade away

Sinners brain was broiled to lie
Feeding flowers that charm eyes
Things held holy, things pervers
Serving our univers
