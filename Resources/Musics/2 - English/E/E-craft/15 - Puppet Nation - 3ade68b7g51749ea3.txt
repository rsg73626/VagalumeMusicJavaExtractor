PUPPET NATION

Puppet Nation

I see the things
The things you cannot grasp
I cut my strings
The puppet strings and cast

I see may nation falls
I see my nation falls
Enslavement mankind calls
I see my nation falls

Blinding prevents
Prevents that you can grasp
I cut my strings
The stringmasters and cast
