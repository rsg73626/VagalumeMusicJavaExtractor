CRAWLERS

Crawlers

Once you were alive
Respected like a god..
But after you had died
You carried the deadÂ´s rod.

Bad ones fear your claw,
The others like your grace,
But people who are crawling,
Will never find a place.

When you were reborn
Fear increased too much,
The dusk followed the dawn
You made yourself to judge.

Disliked crawling creatures,
They hunt for your goodwill.
You crush them with the force,
Of your endangered skill.
