EMBRYONIC

Embryonic

Glass mutations, human machines
Strange killing species Â´ way comes and your screams
Final deep impact, fear in your face
No place for hiding, to finish your race

Solution of nature
Fallout begins
Evolution is over
The life cannot win

Human infects, mental destroy
Extrem silent, death can`t be avoid
Final deep impact, fear in your face
No place for hiding, to finish your race

Organic wreckage, eyes cannot see
His rotten hermit died silently
Final deep impact, fear in your face
No place for hiding, to finish your race
