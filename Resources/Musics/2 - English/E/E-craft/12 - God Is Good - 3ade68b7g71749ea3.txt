GOD IS GOOD

God, you made the world
Unfurled 
All Plants and Flowers
Where able to ordain
All Pain
And joy, so ample where your powers
God, if Im down
Your frown
Tells me to rise
Compared to yours my might
Is slight, 
My life as brief as a mayfly's
God, free me from your priest
Whose feasts
I'm paying for 
For christ's sake let
Me get 
Good value, as I'm weak and poor
