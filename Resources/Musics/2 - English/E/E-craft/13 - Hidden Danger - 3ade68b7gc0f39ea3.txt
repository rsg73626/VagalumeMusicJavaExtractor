HIDDEN DANGER

Your life, your fear are hiding danger.
You accept the chain of steel,
Your thoughts are muddled and confused,
The endless night you feel.

Human desire, the prostitute of time
Always ready for the war

You gave up without a fight
Without a fight and freed from choice.
Gained is your destiny
thatÂ´s your luck nothing more,
Always ready for the war.
