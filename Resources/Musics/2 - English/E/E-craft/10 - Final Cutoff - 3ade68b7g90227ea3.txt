FINAL CUTOFF

I lost the fight for living, 
I miss acknowledgement, 
Defeat is racing towards me, 
I hate its rotten scent. 

I reach my destination 
Obsessive go forward, 
Last time I´m looking back, 
Goodbye to life´s resort. 

Forget hope for redemption 
I despised helpin´ hands, 
Instead of that I lived my life 
And drove it to dead end, 

This life, it ain´t worth living 
It´s better now to stop. 
And while I fade to shadows, 
The next day raises up.
