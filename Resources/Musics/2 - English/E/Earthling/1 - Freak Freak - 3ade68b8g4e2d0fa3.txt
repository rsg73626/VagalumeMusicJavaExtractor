FREAK FREAK

(yes yes)
(freak freak yall)
(yes yes)

Yes yes yall
Freak freak yall
Yes yes yall
Looks like im freakin' some more
Yes yes yall
Freak freak yall
Yes yes yall
Looks like im freakin' some more

Now esoteric lyric
I'm a spirit
See im looking at my bed and my body's still in it
Like in a minute sixty seconds
I reckon
Like i be floating, not stepping
But checkin' out the mad levitation
Immitation b-boys
Corduroys
Gazelles
Kangols
Fhem fuckers, man them dont know the slang though
Not like saxon road to ash burton
Spit mad styles
So much our fuckin' brains be hurtin'
For certain
Were drawing the curtains on pretenders
Mad mao will send you on a frantic agenda
Transport ya like an astronaut
I caught you
Skinny, ninenty pounds,
I sought you out
With the outer body experience
Transcend space and time
I'm leaving you delirious
This shit is serious
Mysterious like pyramids
It's stronger than that crack shit
And that be killing kids
We educated our poison is potent
Like a regular trojan?
Lee perry we floating
Leave your mike open, ill freestyle till its broken
I'm spoken
I'm floating
I'm fucking...

Yes yes yall
Freak freak yall
Yes yes yall
Looks like im freakin' some more
Yes yes yall
Freak freak yall
Yes yes yall

Looks like im spider man
Spider man
I does whatever a spider can
Spins them webs
Any size
Flies in your eyes, you cant see the flys

(oh yes)
Oh yes
