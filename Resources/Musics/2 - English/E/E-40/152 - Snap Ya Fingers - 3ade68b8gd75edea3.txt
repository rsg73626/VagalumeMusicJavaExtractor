[Intro]
What's happenin'? Dis ya boy Lil Jon! BME Clik

Hey! Now ladies and gentlemen it's about dat time
To turn this thang on out

Hey! Let's go!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

[Lil Jon]
Snap ya fingers and then rock wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, gon drop wit it
All my ladies let me see ya put a twist wit it
You can't do like me, I'm by myself
I do it so good, I don't need nobody else
What's happenin', what's up
Got da purk fired up
What's happenin', what's up
Got Patrón in my cup
I pop, I drank
I'm on Patrón and purk, I can't thank
I'm blowed, to the do'
don't know how the hell I'm gettin home

[Hook]

[E-40]
Straight from da bay, posted in the 'A'
Bout to hit the club, we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' some ??, dyin' off Patrón
VIP forbidden, strapped wit my chrome
Look around the club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' from side to side to the beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to the groove
All by they self, that's the new move
Nigga where I'm from, we like to go ??
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how its done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said the Pool Palace
Staright from Bankhead, I said you good at it
Do what cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, the more it's lookin' smooth
I's nuthin to a boss, I can do the shit too

[Hook)]

[Sean Paul]
Chillin' in the bip, yeah we get crunk
Niggaz poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air
I'm throwin' up the E's to let 'em know we in here
Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out the ol school, cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my glock BITCH!
Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from the deck
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on the best, we don't fuck wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah I'm back to the track, back to the snap
1, 2 step, then you gotta lean back
Dis is how we do it in the 'A town'
(and if you ain't know) this how it go down

[Hook]

hey! hei!
