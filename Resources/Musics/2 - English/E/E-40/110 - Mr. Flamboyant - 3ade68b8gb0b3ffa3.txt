MR. FLAMBOYANT

Yeah, I'm just a hustler on the go
Out here get my propers don't ya know
I'm livin' kind of comfortable, large mail and all yeah
And a jealous motherfucker would love to see me fall
Like that, that

When we sell this load
We'll have twice what we started with

Yeah it's that old mackin' fast
Old school gangsta style, smokin' dank
Cognac lounge beat, cognac lounge beat
Motherfucker, cognac lounge beat
M-motherfucker, cognac lounge beat
Yeah it's that old mackin' fast
Old school gangsta style, smokin' dank
Cognac lounge beat, mr. flamboyant
Motherfucker, m-mr. flamboyant
Yes motherfucker

As a youngster I never knew nathin'
Just an inobedient child in the neighborhood
You know the one the police was always chasin'
Straight down and dirty for my props
Eleven years old, extra-manish, hard-headed sellin' rocks
I killed an old wack motherfucker, no one ever bigger than me
Prettiest thing I ever seen, a 1979 air fifteen
Clean, fully automatic and the whole killer kit
It's cops be walkin' up and down the street
Folks be pointin' they fingers sayin' "partner gotta grip"
Basically what I was doin' was protectin' my people
My million dollar spots, it was my duty
Got paid to guard the whole motherfuckin' block
Try to catch me if you can, now that I'm a grown man
The mail I got stashed away, people will never know
Mr. flamboyant

I came in here on business
I-I-I came in here on business
It could work out pretty good
It could work out pretty good

Yeah pertainin' to this bein' a dog ass world and all
A brother need some kind of occupaton to make his mail stand tall
Whether it's slangin' em' or whatever ya do man
Just make sure you true to the game

Still in the game everything pretty much the same
Tryin' to reach a certain goal
But I gotta dish that during metro
Alcohol and tobacco and bureau, feds and the dea
Just to run up on me when I'm off that there grandma yay
Well what if they block and slap yo ass in the truck
Partner, if this was a fifth all of us would be drunk
Don't even like rockin' bleach
Trippin' on petty crunk shit like that
What is he sayin' brother
He might be talkin' bout how it's to the back
Me and my pussy was comin' around the corner on these shoes
I mean wheels, yeah in this 76 cutlass oldsmobile
Turnin' 360's like he was an alaskan mobile
Sittin' on gold ones hot flamin' didn't really know the deal
I sais "what's the fuck wrong with you, you crazy motherfucker"
Partner back there tried to mean mug me
And turn me like I was a sucker
So slow ya lil' ass down on this side of town
Before you find yourself either melted or beat down

Like that and that's on the goose my brother
Because now days a dollar comes harder than a motherfucker
So if you out in that world don't get caught or be slippin'
Cause today's society ain't trippin'

Ah hay ah hay ah hay
Ah hay ah hay ah hay
Yeah

There's a fortune in this business
There's a-there's a fortune in this business

Mr. flamboyant yeah that just might be yo name
The center of attention, money, fame
Fuckin' with just rain or crazed insane
Leader of the squad, much younger than gangs
See he rolls the whole unit in a big simple pipe
Foams stirs let it settle and then make it light
Lookin' like rats, real swing when his bottles mail
Spark off a hill, five hundred grams
Pertainin' to the triple beam scale
Solid as rock, white white white
A-1 peep pistol plan
Nothin' with scandalous ass cakin' baking soda
Whether you know it or not here's a dog scale
You gotta watch ya back or playa will
Way to many brothers get took for large sums but me
You can't be frail and don't be light with ya narrow ass
Gain ya weight
Drink beer by the case, it's not too late
Become a savage, get smoked once what ya want to establish
One hitter quitters, the ho get down run up on me now

Ooh e why you come at em' like that man
You know they can't understand that shit
When you doin' about a buck fifty man
But now put that shit oin perspective for em' though

Man check this out my side hog
Due to the fact that I am at liberty
To release such valuable information towards the public
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Every one of my last side hogs been hollerin' at me
Demandin' that I define the definition of mr. flamboyant
Pertainin' to me havin' inherited
The gift to spit so I had to like let loose

Like that, well ya know the shit is good listenin' man
But now I want you to go back
To the tune you was doin' earlier in that song
You know that lil' tune ya was doin'
