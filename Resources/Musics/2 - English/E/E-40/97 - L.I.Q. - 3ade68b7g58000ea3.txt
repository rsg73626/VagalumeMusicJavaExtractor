L.I.Q.

[E-40]
Mobb that shit out nigga!
Bosko, mobb that shit, BEYOTCH!
Mobb shit (mobb shit)
We invented this shit (what'd we do?)
Boy I helped pioneer this
Boy I helped pioneer this..
.. HOE BEOTCH!

I'm irkin; head spinnin dome swervin
Emergin to the right to the left, see three, hallucinatin
Stoned ain't got a lick but a bra protection on my phone
therefore that'll make it this that much easier
for anybody with a computer that got the right data information
software to CLONE, clone it off the streets - how much?
Basshead dis down playa price boy a hundred piece (hundred piece)
Shit I don't figure dat dere ain't no mo' worse than clonin sheep
Just understand, I dub this for my weeples
More hair on my face than my daddy do (daddy do)
I guess it's them steroids that they been puttin in our food (in our food)
Shit the man behind the counter at the liquor store asked him for ID
before he get to askin me and if he ask me for ID then I'ma get
?? bitch to use some of that swindlin ass fast-fast talkin
con man ?? in the ghetto urban reverse psychology
Niggaz got it tough out here; tough out here, it's rough
Niggaz got it rough out here; nigga out here it's tough

Chorus: E-40 (repeat 2X)

Let's hit the weed spot, let's hit the L.I.Q.
Let's hit the liquor sto', let's hit the L.I.Q.
Let's hit the house party, let's hit the L.I.Q.
"Pull up sideways, doin about a buck-fifty"

[E-40]
"Hello my friend!"  Whassuper dude?
Give me a pack of sunflower seeds 
and a box of larger size Magnum rubbers
A generic lemon squeeze lime juice
and a bottle of Goldschlager
A pack of licorice, lick-em-and-lock-em Zig-Zags
a hard boiled egg and them pickled pig feet (pickled pigs feet)
Shit I gotta do as much fuckin and partyin as I can
I gotta go turn myself in next week (BEOTCH)
I'm up all night - playawhatchagonnabedoin?
Up in somebody's ?? layin pipe
Bitchbetalkinaboutsuin and try to accuse yo' ass of rape;
cause you rap
Sa' HOE, I ain't even tryin to entertain that
See I dip in mo' holes than a golf ball
Pussy fallin all out of my Granada
Squabs in Kansas City, squabs in Colorado
Learned how to pop my collar in the city where they shot The Mack
Dem were some of the players that helped tie my shoes and lace me
name was Curtis and B.O.
Well whaddya know?  Doo doo dirt clucks ??
Messy and tap that ass fool we in hella mo' (BEOTCH)
Bitch-ass niggaz like B-Legit and ?? ??
and Mac-Shon, mack D-Shot and Lil' Bruce - BEOTCH!

Chorus

[E-40]
On the dope track where the bassheads be comin through
I see more killings and more hop than the kangaroo
My baby's momma she sick, she on that glass dick
Be crawlin all on the RUG lookin for that shit!
Hogan High School prom queen right?
On her hands and knees pickin up lint and anything that's white
That's how you can tell that a dopefiend's gone psycho
when they get to hah.. lookin all out the curtains with they high beams
On the corner, be that dice game unfoldin (what happened?)
One of my dudes, SERIOUSLY, he rollin
then a couple of fools pull up and went for theirs a-course
with intentions of splittin my wig but it wound up gettin reversed
I left they kite flyin, down for the grind, witnesses dissolve
A prime example of bad karma, Murphy's Law
If you gon' be a fool then be a fool, shit
But just know when to act a fool and who to act a fool with!

Chorus
