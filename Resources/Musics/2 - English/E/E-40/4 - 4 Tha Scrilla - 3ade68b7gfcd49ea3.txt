4 THA SCRILLA

[Celly] 
A slave to the hood without no money in my pants 
Rollin with some heat to make a mothafucka dance 
Had a chance to bail, had my hustle, but I blew that 
I walked up in the gun store and ran out with a new gat 
A double 4, out on my million dollar mission 
To eleven fishin, kissin on my chrome, with scrilla in my vision 
Can't move without the metal 
Wanna hustle, so I figure I go out there when they posted up 
And bust a nigga 

[E-40] 
But I'll go another way 
Hopefully payday 
But if I slip, dislocated ?my hip? 
And say what I gotta say boy 
That's my new get-back 
All kinds of things of that flava 
The racketeering counterfeiter, nigga 
Or half of whatever 
Long as the weather's clever 
My ?? might become a snitch for the vice 
Ain't no killin, that's what hell told me 
10 mil-a, then nigga break for the scrilla 

[B-Legit] 
Drunk niggas with the gauges loaded 
55 kicks in them ages ho 
But I don't want to beef cuz the game be fucked 
Strip a mothafucka for his cars and money 
Tag up a 600 SEL 
A three-way split, me, 40 and Cel 
About my mail, I was bound to have it 
See you fuckin with a mothafuckin savage

50 ways to get my scratch on fool

[B-Legit] 
It's uh, for the scrilla, I did it for the scrilla 
[Celly] 
See I'm nothin but a killa doin dirt for the scrilla
