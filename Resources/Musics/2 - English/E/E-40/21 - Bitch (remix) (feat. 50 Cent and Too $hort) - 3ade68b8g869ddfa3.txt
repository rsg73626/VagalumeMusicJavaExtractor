BITCH (REMIX) (FEAT. 50 CENT AND TOO $HORT)

[Chorus 1: Too $hort (50 Cent)]
Nigga don't act like a BITCH! (haha!)
That's why I never love a BITCH! (yeah!)
50 Cent, Too $hort and E-40 say BITCH! (Remix!)
She sucked me off, don't kiss that BITCH!
(From New York to Bay! - From New York to Bay!)
Ohh, why? Ohh, why'd you marry that BITCH?

[50 Cent:]
He said he love her mayne, you really think he love her, mayne
She a superfreak, freakier, than he understand!
She's not the type of girl that you take home to your mother
She's the type you take to the track to come up on sucker!
Watch her deep throat! - See a D.P.

Hitting off on hoes like it's easy.
It's not a big deal, she doin' what she do
She doin' it with everybody, not just you;
Hello! (haha!) - I'm tryna put you up on game

You get emotional, then you could get the fuck on, mayne.
You buy her everything, you let her treat ya like a trick,
You sugar daddy mentality will make a nigga sick!
She ask for you just finna get it for he (r)

No matter how much you give he (r), she wants more!
I hate to tell you, but you end up with a whore
And chances are nigga try they gonna score. 
- Man fuck that bitch! - (Hahaaa!)

[Chorus 2: Too $hort]
That's why I'll never love a BITCH!
50 Cent, Too $hort and E-40 say BITCH!
She sucked me off, don't kiss that BITCH!
Ohh, why? Ohh, why'd you marry that BITCH?

[Too $hort (50 Cent):]
I get everything I wanna get
I have some fun with it. - And make her momma trip.
Cause if I'm in her life - it's a problem!
A real player's at your girl, you better stop him! 
(whooooooo-whooooooooo!)

Turn your back on the bitch she ain't actin' right
He hit it way before you now he's back in her life. (haha!)
What'chu gon' do when you lose her?
She got a nigga on the side just to use her! (AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!)

If it's me, I'm parkin at the front do'
And you be knockin on her bedroom window!
You see the shadows! - You hear the sounds
But you don't do nothin' you just turn back around,
Like a BITCH! - Feelings hurt, ready to cry!
You cain't believe, everything she said was a lie.
She got a lot of bitch in her but not more than you
I never underestimate - what y'all boys'll do!

[Chorus 3: 50 Cent (Too $hort)]
(BITCH!) - You love her. - I fuck her!
She my jump-off she yo' baby mama.
You kiss her. - I twist her
And send her ass back to you before you miss her! (BITCH!)

[Bridge: Too $hort]
I'm a playa, baby!
I don't play no games (BITCH!)
I remain the same, I ain'T never gon' change my ways for no BITCH!
That's why I'll never love a BITCH!
50 Cent, Too $hort and E-40 say BITCH!
She sucked me off, don't kiss that BITCH!
Ohh, why? Ohh, why'd you marry that BITCH?

[E-40:]
40! Never-slippin'-and-slippin'-and-skippin'-and-drippin' and missin'! (missin'!)
These cats that I be hangin' around don't listen! (don't listen!)
I-be-hippin'-and-sippin'-and-smokin'-and-drinkin' and spittin', (spittin'!)
And these musty mouth broads they be trippin'! (they be trippin'!)
I mean the bitch thought she was bad. (bad!) - 
I knew what that batch was thinkin'
When she thought what she was thinkin'. - 
But she shouldn'ta thought that!

I told her the money costs too much and I ain't got a dime (got a dime!)
You got to pay me! (pay me!) - Or pay me no never mind! (uhh!)
I-I don't sit on the toilet when I go piss (piss!)
You-you got feminine tendencies like a bitch! (bitch!)
Me-me I'm solid and concrete I keep it funky (funky!)

We-we we pull up in somethin, actin a donkey. (donkey!)
She-she she liftin' her dress up showin' her monkey, (monkey!)
See-see he trippin, he trickin, throwin her money! (money!)
B-B-I-T-C-H, all in her face (face!)
E-E-40 so laced, stay on the case! - AHHHH!

[Chorus]
