BALLAHOLIC

Iâ€™m in my Fubu drawers, she in her gown
Is it some cats tryinâ€™a have at me or is it the canine and the batteram
Planninâ€™ on splittinâ€™ my crown but it ainâ€™t gone be too simple
See Iâ€™m a baller, Iâ€™ve got bars around the windows, Rottweilers, pits, Akitas
Doberman Pinchers taped up in the yard With a sign on the fence that reads 
Warning â€“ Beware of Dogs
Leap like a frog if you feel froggish, nigga leap
Like to neglect my dogs, starve â€˜em, sometimes they donâ€™t eat
Elroys questioning me about my triple beam â€“ officer, I got proof!
Po-Po! Thatâ€™s for weighing nuts and fruits!
Run with a whole bunch of rugged-ass rowdy knuckleheads â€“ know what I mean
Big niggas â€“ the size of a football team
I wear these glasses so I can look like a square but if you ever see me in a 
fight with a bear, donâ€™t help me, nigga help the bear! Me and my whales, we be 
cooninâ€™ â€“ but see you the type of nigga that go in the back room and Beep 
yoâ€™self and act like yoâ€™ pagerâ€™s boomin

Iâ€™ll have you know ever since I was ankle low to a centipedeâ€™s toe I always 
wanted to flow play pro baseball Weepolization family, thatâ€™s my favorite sport
But instead Iâ€™m back and forth to jail and in and out of court
Serious about my rock shrine I donâ€™t give a fuck how much courage juice you 
had, nigga yoâ€™ mug donâ€™t mean like mine - I bring the noise like a cymbal
I fuck with 40 nem, make ya stick yoâ€™ pistol out the window
Yâ€™all otta see me at the state fair showinâ€™ off in front of my broad tryinâ€™a 
win my little nieces
One of the biggest stuffed animal prices there
Nickname is Charlie but my street name is EARL! 
Ballaholic like Felix Mitchell newphew little Darryl
I know the streets like the task force know dope
I am the streets my ghetto pass canâ€™t be revoked
Ten percent I pay my tithe forgive me for my sins
Smoke a ounce a weed a day maybe thatâ€™s why I ainâ€™t got no wind

You can call me Lawryâ€™s cause Iâ€™m seasoned I eat crevey â€“ but not when itâ€™s 
bleedinâ€™
Donâ€™t get me wrong I love sex but I donâ€™t play that part
I love Virginia â€“ but not when the Virginiaâ€™s tart
And if itâ€™s good then I might Dolce & Gabbana it
Gave yoâ€™ ass some bread and let you go buy up some shit
Callinâ€™ yoâ€™self takinâ€™ advantage of my riches
Iâ€™m tryinâ€™a be nice to yo' ass, I normally talk bad about you bitches
Inducted into the hall of game back in the via
Notorious for slappinâ€™ chicken heads upside they weava wit my nokia
Mayday mayday I canâ€™t call it all patrol cars and units be on the lookout for 
the hillside finagler forty water the ballaholic
Iâ€™d rather fly than ride Amtrak! When Iâ€™m in Dallas I fuck with C-Bo and Go 
Hard Black
Maka opera singer want to write some raps
I'm papered uuup! (like who?) Like a fax
