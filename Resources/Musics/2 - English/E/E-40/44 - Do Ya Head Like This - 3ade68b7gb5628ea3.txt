[Doe - verse 2]

but now im back and i hope ya dont do that ...
soul is the heart of it i hope i can get every lil bit of it
but sometimes ya gotta slow it down
like the few Mc's that do shows in my town
back in 2000 the rap game was lackin
like some of them rappers bringin two steps back in

Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this

Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
