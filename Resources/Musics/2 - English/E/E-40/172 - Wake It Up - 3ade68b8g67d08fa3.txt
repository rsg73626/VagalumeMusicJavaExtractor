WAKE IT UP

Yeah.... 
I know you aint used to havin real niggas like me around 
I'm here to change to your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns 
And treat you like a superstar that you are 
cause I'm a superstar too and I know exactly what I must do to make you... Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
See I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! 
Don't It feel so good girl Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
See I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! 
Don't It feel so good girl 

[Verse One - E-40] 
I keep it 100's, don't carry nothing but 100's 
I'm trying to wake it up, 
I'm on your line like Vonage I'm a real one, Ma! 
Get rid of that clown, Get with a factor 
Patna don't count, 
he a lame he don't matter 
Shining like a big dipper, glowing like a star 
Lookin up a paw, pullin up in my car 
Walked right up to the front where the bosses park at 
I got a cold mouth piece can talk a chick out her check 
Security loves me, let me in with no sweat 
I see asian persuasion, Caucasians, all kinds of chicks 
Milk skin, chocolate boned, lambs and Haitians 
Tryna take me something home and have some relation 

[Chorus - Akon] 
I know you aint used to havin real niggas like me around 
I'm here to change to your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns 
And treat you like a superstar that you are 
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know exactly what I must do to make you... Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
See I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! 
Don't It feel so good girl Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
See I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! 
Don't It feel so good girl 

[Verse Two - E-40] 
Good God Almighty! 
Look at that body What you holdin? 
Girl you a banger! 
You ain't off the back porch, you're off the HANGER! 
You working with something, you gotta personal trainer? 
Whole crew fine but you're one of a kind You a ten piece, 
shawty you a dime Back that thang up, 
baby press rewind 
Imma Scorpio, Shawty whats your sign? 
I'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation 
Spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin' 
Spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up 
Imma show you how a tycoon wake that thang up 

[Chorus - Akon] 
I know you aint used to havin real niggas like me around 
I'm here to change your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns 
And treat you like a superstar that you are 
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know exactly what I must do to make you... Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
See I'm about to wake it up! Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! 
Don't It feel so good girl Feel! 
I'm about to wake it up! Feel!

Love the way you that shake it up 
Too natural you to make it up 
Won't be long till we wake it up 

[Chorus - Akon]
