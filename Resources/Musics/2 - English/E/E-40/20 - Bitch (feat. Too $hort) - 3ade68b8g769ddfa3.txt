BITCH (FEAT. TOO $HORT)

[Chorus]
Nigga don't act like a BITCH
That's why i don't got love for a BITCH
Oh that's why too short & E-40 say BITCH
(BIATCH!)
So homie please don't marry that BITCH
(don't do it)
That's why i'll never be a BITCH

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
see me i get everything i wanna get
i have some fun with it & make her mama trip
cause if i'm in her life, it's a problem
a real players got your girl you better sock them
turn your back on the bitch, she ain't actin' right
he hit it way before you now he's back in her life
whatchu gon' do when you lose her? 
she gotta nigga on the side just to use her
if it's me i'm parkin' at the front door
& you be knockin' on her bedroom window
you see the shadows you hear 
the sounds but you don't 
do nothing you just turn back around like a BITCH

(BIATCH!)
feelings hurt ready to cry, 
you can't believe everything she said was a lie
she got a lot of bitch in her but not more than you
i never underestimate

[Chorus]
Nigga don't act like a BITCH
That's why i don't got love for a BITCH
Oh that's why too short & E-40 say BITCH
(BIATCH!)
So homie please don't marry that BITCH
That's why i'll never be a BITCH

[Verse 2: E-40]
it's all good
never sippin' n slippin' n skippin' n drippin' n missin' (missin)
this bastard i be hangin' around don't listen (listen)
i be hippen and sippen and smoking and drinking and spittin (spittin)
but the musty mouth broads they be trippin' (trippin)
i mean the bitch thought she was bad
but i don't know what that batch was thinkin'
what she thought she was thinkin' but she shouldn't have thought that
i told her the money cost to much i ain't got it down
you gotta pay me
or pay me no, never mind
ah ah 
goes inventory when i go piss
you got feminine tendancies like a bitch
me (me) i'm solid as concrete i keep it soft [?]
we (we) keep pearl up or something back in the dark
she (she) liftin' her dress up showin' her monk
see( see), he trippin', he trickin' throwin' her mon---
b (b) i t c h all in her face
E (E) 40 so late, stay on the case

[Chorus]
Nigga don't act like a BITCH
That's why i don't got love for a BITCH
Oh that's why too short & E-40 say BITCH
(BIATCH!)
So homie please don't marry that BITCH
That's why i'll never be a BITCH
