SEASONED

[E-40]
Uh, you in a new school whip custom painted candy apricot butter
I'm in an antique oldschool four door muffler draggin' beat up duster
Wit scrapes and scratches, nicks and scars
Y'all git to drink out of wine glasses, we gotta drink out of jelly jars
Down and out like four flat tires no washing machine nor dryer
Just ah pillow sack 
and ah bunch of clothes wrapped in a sheet on our way to the laundrymat
Will I ever get paid, can I make a dollar out of fifteen cent
Y'allz got it made, we broke and starvin' barely payin' the rent
Sleepless nights, alligator tears
Mommy arguin' wit my daddy, daddy drunk too many beers
911 Mr.Po, Po dey ain't happy wit day marriage
Pops tryn'a beat her down and make her have a miscarriage
My cousin shoots the needle, she be gone for days
She on that da ah diesel, she gone end up wit aids
I told her I love her but you know what she said to me
Everybody got a gay or atleast one dope fiend in they family
You ain't the only one wit a reject in yo family
That's real

	The reasoned the reasoned that we are seasoned
	Seasoned that we fill our paper want disappear
	Ohe, hey it's been a long time in the bay 
	with God on our side we have somethin' to say 
	and the and through the hard times we survive the game
	Survive the game

If y'all smell onions dat's my arms potent
the reason I'm musty is 'caus ewe ain't got no mo' deordorant 
The laughing stock patna, we aint got no cash
Feet stinking through my shoes in p.e. class
I'm thriznew wit biznieng brizoke
I'm about to hiznit the griznind and if I git popped it ain't half no more
it's eighty percent of my time 
But that's ah cha ah chance that I'm a have to ah take
Today my son birthday and I can't even buy a cake
I'm so damn through ah through I had a j.o.b
You want me to cut my perm, oh y'all gone ave to fire me
My fellow just got out da joint, that he might be o.k.
But my fellow got out and got stabbed twenty-six times that same damn day
Who wanted to git dunked on in the the flatlands 
it ain't never too late patna
All we need is a piece of plywood and a milk carton crate
What about dat shopping basket, you know I'm smart
We can gone take the wheels off that and ma ah make a go cart
Yo peoples blessed you, I started from a quarter ounce
You came in the dope game wit a silver spoon up in yo' mouth
Why we gotta gamble maine 
We hurtin', you got all the bucks
In the ghetto we play dominoes for push ups
	
	The reasoned the reasoned that we are seasoned 
	Seasoned that we fill our paper won't disappear
	Ohe, it's been a long time in the bay
	with God on our side we have somethin' to say
	and the and through the hard times  we survive the game
