I don't like it, I love it
I wanna grip it and touch it
I'm tryna hit it and fuckin stab me
That speakin and stuckin
Get you to lick it and suck it
And kiss it after I'm at it
We can be friends, I gotta be seen in the public
I'm about that verb, that action
Have a coochie, how it contracts
When I be smashin and smackin inside
I'm thrustin the thrash
Sit back and relax and have a glass of this bottle
Earl Stevens selections, mango muscato
Then back by Selena, seem like I already knew you
Beautiful girl you so bad
Look like somebody done drew you mind
I salute you, you a cypher so eyes booty and thighs
You and yo girl should get with me and my guys
Come and get a boy that's mackin

Baby girl that dude is a cat

But once he got he ain't good he started dogging you out
