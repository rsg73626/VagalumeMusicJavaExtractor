[E-40]
When I first started off niggas had me fucked, muthafuckas was blind
in '89 that ol "Mr. Flamboyant" shit was way ahead of his time
had everyone an they great grandmas off that Carlos Rossi wine
was in a major label an business that uh didn't want us to shine
it was me an my potna from Suave House Records
Tony Draper, E-40, an The Click
8-Ball, an MJG gettin that independent paper
all about my ruh-uh-rap, uh-should I shine
beat a muthafucka uh-duh-down, e'ry time
40 get yo marbles man, get yo change
take a limosuine everywhere you go and fly private planes
that's what I was taught to do
by my big homie thou
you can always be a nigga, 
but a nigga ain't rich til he can't count his money no mo'
over night sensation, never me
all you "Record Haters" got Ph.IV
my niggas 3X Krazy laced me
taught me how to say "fa sheezy"
told me that them AZ muthafuckas don't believe phat means greasy
we can shoot it out, or we can fight
You an Rasheeda wanna squash the funk?
Shoot me some peace bitch!

*(Chorus)*

Record Hatin bitches!
(Record hatin bitches!)
Suave game and snitches!
(Suave game and snitches!)
We should cease you from existance.
(That's rich.)
Niggas like that shouldn't be livin.
(Suck-els!)
Ya Record Hatin bitches
(Lil ol, biatch!)
There's no way you could get wit this
(That's right.)
We should cease you from existance
(Learn about it.)
Niggas like that shouldn't be livin.
