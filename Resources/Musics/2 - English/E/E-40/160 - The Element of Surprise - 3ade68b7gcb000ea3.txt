THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE

Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise....
(surprise niggas!!!)
Biotch!!!
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise nigga!!
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise nigga!!
Surprise, them lies, im talking about the element of surprise

Time to go get some getback, never sit back
Why should i wait on a muthafucka to come and get me
When a muthafucka like me can whip back
If so step back, tax a muthafucka hella quickly
With a twenty guage, fully tellie
Have at his ass first, little remorse
St. valentines day massacre
Tryin?to hit that patna, dude in the passenger seat
Lesabre, bitch played us, he hate us, bitch made us
Its heinous, he hate us, disobeyed us, hiatus
Underrate us, underpaid us, tried to spray us and erase us
And is on, wonder if its good or bad karma
So dont try to figure out, try to find out, its a drought
Maybe thats why everybody walking here around with they lips poked out
So if you rook me
>from enhancing growl, come and hook me
Buying yellow clusters instead of counterfiet dope
Alexander the great, macadamia nut, chief rockin?soap
No rebate, no refunds
Fuck em and feed em deacons
Money back guarantee my ass
This is the future, that was the past
Sqare aint nothin?bout this game we playa style
Able to smoke weed but you keep on laughin?and smilin
Set your ass up executional style
Hit em in the back of the head until they dead
Down on the floor spread, they layin?liquid body clot, reekin?brains in the sky
Sleepin? nighty night nigga, nighty night nigga!!
Them niggas gone from magazines
I aint even try my 4th of july pal

Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, them lies, im talking about the element of surprise

Here come a hundred of them dudes, fifth deep
Carryin?hero firearm, cause its nice to be dry
Forteen and over logs and ygs ready to put down a homicide
Forty-five colt firearm, remington sixteen guage shot gun
Two of them ultra-light machine bombers, ar fifteen and tommy guns
Ready to run into bumbles
Rushin? all i need is a shooter with a rueger ticket
See the definition of the element of surprise is when a nigga least expect it
Retrospect it, it gets hectic (minds hectic)
See he probably would have been able to prevent if he wouldve saw it comin?but he didnt, so hes in it, nigga shouldve went against the grain
See thats the perfect example of the kind of shit that can happen to a
Muthafucka when he owe too much to the game
When a sucka owe too much to the game
That aint wise, see i got guys, somebody dies

Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprizise, you got a bullet in your bizack
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprizise, you got a bullet in your bizack
Surprise, them lies, im talking about the element of surprise

Sittin?here, just well let the fonk die down for a minute or two
Make it look like we a bunch of cuts finna beef
And get into it with some old other crew and hit all they spots at once
Do what we came to do and then get about our business with no delaying
Lets end it up and hit the freeway
I tell my v-lay, i bet you cant do the samething all over and over again
For something like about a weekand a half straight
Duplicate to instant replay, i hate haters that be hatin?on players like me
And the c-l-i-c-k
See what a sucka dont know is what a sucka cant see
And what a sucka cant see is what a sucka dont know
Finger on the chrome
Ridin?crusty with my war face on
Out the window yellin?die bitch die, die bitch die, die bitch die.....
