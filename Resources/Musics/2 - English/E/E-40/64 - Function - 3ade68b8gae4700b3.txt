FUNCTION

[Pré-Refrão]
Hey, hey bitch, try this!
Guarantee turn a square to a bop bitch
You ain't down, bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man

[Refrão: 2x]
We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man
We out here tryna function

We out here tryna function, bitch
You're fuckin' off my high, get up out my mix
You're messing up my vibe, I'm trying to get some crevice
Put her in my ride, take her to the Ritz
I'm toasted and sloppy, offa my broccoli, Bacardi
151 out my body, I'm about that green like wasabi
Like Embory we robbin', we bouncin, back the fuck off me
Getting money my hobby, not getting money is not
Only rappers I listen to is E-40 and Pac
I'm having my revenue playa havin' his guap
I'm on my fly big nigga shit I'm stayin laced and groomed
I spray myself with sucka repellent my nigga, not perfume
Anything you got, I can sell it a hustler think I can't
Use the gaps of the White House, black paint
Word candy S-L-A-N-G
I'm thinkin bout takin a million dollar insurance policy out on my mouthpiece

Hey bitch, OK bitch
It's uncle Earl and the HBK bitch
Mention the gang they already know that we ballin
I'm coming straight out the Rich
I got family down in New Orleans
Where you from, you say you're lying
Out here we say that you jonesin'
You probably thought this never would happen my niggas been called that
Alcoholic, when sippin that liquor, oh I'm drunk as hell
Fuckin witta a lil bitch over in Vallejo
Got a whole pack of pre-rolled Young L's
And I'm never down to uno, pockets on sumo
Haters respect the pedigree, ballin heavily
A phony homie, I'll never be for methamphetamine
That means it's crack hoe, young G, hotter than Tabasco
I smash hoes, collect two hunnid and pass GO
My flow so Lamborghini, yo shit's so Rav 4
Now you understand why everything I do I gas hoe, Suzy, nigga
