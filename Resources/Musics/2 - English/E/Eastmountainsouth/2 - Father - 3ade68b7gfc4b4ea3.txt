FATHER

I hold in my heart this pain that I feel
a man I call father, well, he's almost real… 
he's almost real...
and I'm of his flesh and bone
so similar and estranged and I was just a child when
you went away
when you went away

away...
away...
away...

father, you know...
and yet, I still hold you 
well, it's up and to this day
father answer my questions
‘ cause I still need you... I still need you
I am one of two
and I still need you 
I am one of two
am I... am I... like you...?
