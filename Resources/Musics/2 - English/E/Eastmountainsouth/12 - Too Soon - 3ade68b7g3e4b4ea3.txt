TOO SOON

through love’s labor,
her labor
sons and daughters were blessed and given favor

she smiled and we were safe
she cried the cords gave way
we grew into life
we left our homes too soon
too soon... too soon.. too soon..

my mother’s face
her state of grace
I hope I have your strength and all your gentle ways

she smiled and we were safe
she cried the cords gave way
we grew into life
we left our homes too soon... too soon...
too soon.. too soon

as the years, they come and go
she will find her soul
in quiet life. she will hear
those voices sound so sweet and clear
so sweet and clear… so sweet and clear
so sweet and clear… so sweet and clear

it's too soon
too soon… too soon... it's too soon...
... yeah... hey...yeah...yeah...
yeah
