WINTER

was it really
years ago
did you need me
well, I'll never know
I'm sorry for clinging
I'm sorry for wanting more
my heart was there for you pounding down your door

maybe it was timing
maybe I was too much
running behind you 
pushing my love
well, you weren't ready
and you said you thought I knew
but I was taken by your beauty
I was lost inside of you

winter made a sound
maybe next time if you need me
I'll be around... He'll be around... He'll be around
He'll be around

I never meant to swallow you
you never were my savior maybe just my lover
maybe nothing more

now one more winter
has passed so silently
and I'm tired of longing
that you'll come back to me

winter made a sound
maybe next time 
if you need me... yeah… you'll need me
and winter made a sound
I know… if you love me
I'll be around… He'll be around… He'll be around
He'll be around

now one more winter I know… now one more winter I
know...
hey… yeah... hey... yeah...
