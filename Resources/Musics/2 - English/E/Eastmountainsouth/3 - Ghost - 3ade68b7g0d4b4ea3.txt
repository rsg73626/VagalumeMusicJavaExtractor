GHOST

the ghost of you
has almost faded now
you’re drifting in and out
of my life
when leaves fall you'll come right back
‘ cause I was yours for a little while

you will always be
a ghost who lives and breathes
and you lay me down in reverie
every tear that falls
remember me

and I thought I heard your haunting sigh
like your love for me, you said it will never die
but I’ve grown accustomed to your long good-bye
I wish you were mine
Hey... you were mine

you will always be
a love who failed to see
it was cold inside your mystery
every year that falls 
remember me

and I can’t let you go
I can't let you go
no

you will always be
a ghost who lives and breathes
and you broke my heart 
but I'll make you see 
every tear that falls 
remember me

hey......
hey......
hey....... yeah....
every tear that falls 
remember me...
