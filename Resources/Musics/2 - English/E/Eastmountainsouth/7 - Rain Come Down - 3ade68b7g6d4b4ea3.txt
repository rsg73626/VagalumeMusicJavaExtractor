RAIN COME DOWN

dark clouds a'risin'
thunder bolts a'rollin'
master Jesus ridin' around
with a rainbow 'round his shoulder
see the lightnin’ flashin’
sinners stand and tremble
master Jesus ridin' around
with a rainbow 'round his shoulder

rain come down, rain come down
hear Him above ridin' around.....

seek all, you seeker
come go to glory with me
you shall wear a starry crown
come join the band of angels

rain come down, rain come down
hear Him above ridin' around.....
rain come down, rain come down
hear Him above ridin' around.....

rain come down, rain come down
hear Him above ridin' around.....
rain come down, rain come down
hear Him above ridin' around.....
rain come down, rain come down
hear Him above ridin' around.....
