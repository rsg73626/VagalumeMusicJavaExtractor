ON YOUR WAY

I hope he never hurts you like I know I hurt you
but I was undecided and it was all that I could do
but if he says he loves you like I know I loved you
then there's a way to trust him, and Iâ€™ll get over you

so let his heart surround you, and let his arms protect you
and hold you every morning the way that I could never do
another life has blessed you, he wants the same as you do
so I must find the courage to send you on your way

all the nights reflecting in our chance connecting
help me find the meaning in the life I had with you
I wish I'd heard when you said that your heart could not wait
but it was my decision to send you on your way....

I hope he loves you like I loved you, I hope he knows you like I do
'cause if he loves you like I love you, then I can send you on your way...
