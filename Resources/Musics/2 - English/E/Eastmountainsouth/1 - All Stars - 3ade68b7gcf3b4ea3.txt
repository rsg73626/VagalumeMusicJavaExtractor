ALL STARS

they would say you were destined for greatness
and I could see it in all the faces
how they loved you, they adored you
but you would sing with a pain they never knew

all the madness was never familiar
and their affection was much too peculiar
to sustain you, to protect you
to ever save you from the pain they never knew

all the stars that fill the sky
they burn out before our eyes

all the sadness you carried inside
you never showed it, it was easy to hide
you'd tell your stories in all their sorrow
you'd take the stage like there was no tomorrow
