MARK'S SONG

may your soul be blessed 
may your body rest
on the mountain where you were born
may your spirit soar
where there's joy ever more
may you find your way in peace

and there’s no more harm
in your savior’s arms
see you fly away in the sky
did you hear the call of angels one and all
may you find your way peace

may you know you’re loved 
may you shine above on the mountain where you were born
may your spirit soar
there’s no pain anymore
may you find your way in peace

and there’s no more harm
in your savior’s arms
see you fly away in the sky
did you hear the call of angels one and all

may you find your way in peace
may you find your way in peace
may you find your way in peace
