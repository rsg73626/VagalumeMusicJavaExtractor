SHOW ME THE RIVER

I've been a traveler of far away lands

I've got love on my mind, but death on these hands

come homeward angel, show me the way

or will fate leave me dead in the tracks where I lay



show me the river that leads to my home

back to the one that I love

show me the wind that constantly blows

and I will fly away, fly away home



since we were parted I know I have changed

you'll see the blood that was shed in the lines on my face

but now that I've turned my back on the fight

I'm gonna steal back my life like a thief in the night



chorus



I come to you through fire and snow

over high rolling hills through the valleys below

with all that I've suffered I'm still on this road

and if I hold you again I will never let go.
