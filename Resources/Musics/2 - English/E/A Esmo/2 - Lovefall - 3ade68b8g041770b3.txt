LOVEFALL

Hey, my dear
The hope is the first spark
My life seems to bend
Lead the way to the dark
Like a waterfall, I saw
A way to make me drown
In my head
You see that?

See our love just fall
While you fly higher
See our love just fall
I just want to be alone

Oh, my love
Our home is where we imagine to be
In the heart drawed in the wall
In the kiss that forms the sea
I'll never let you go again
I'll never burry this things
In my head
You see that?

See our love just fall
While you fly higher
See our love just fall
I just want to be alone

Cuz this makes me feel in home
Your love deserts me
I just wanna be alone

See our love just fall
While you fly higher
See our love just fall
I just want to be alone
