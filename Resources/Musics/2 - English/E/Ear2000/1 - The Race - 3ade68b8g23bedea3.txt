THE RACE

Time has played a game with me
My heart has skipped a beat
A path
A tragedy awaits you at the end of the day. how could you do this to me?
My black eyes just began to see
The world
My future has just ended today once again i search about the crowd
I search about the love allowed
Then quickly snatch away
I want another friend i can't talk to you anymore
We can't sleep together anymore
I couldn't want anything more
I want you more killing me you're killing me you're killing me again
Killing me i'm killing you just killing me my friend how could i lie to myself?
Sick of myself
Throw my head death would take me away
I'd be lucky to be dead damned i stand damned
I've been waiting everyday
Stays the same
Times a game
Times ashamed of me killing me you're killing me you're killing me again
Killing me i'm killing you just killing me my friend i wanna get shot
Its gotta stop
And i'll keep goin until i'm caught
Shoot me please between the eyes and end this misery now that you hate me
I love you even more
Can't dent on me
Bent on my destruction
Rotten to my core i've been burnt before
And i'll be burnt again
A bitter shell
Burning in hell
Seems like home to me
I think i'll stay awhile killing me you're killing me you're killing me again
Killing me i'm killing you just killing me my friend.
