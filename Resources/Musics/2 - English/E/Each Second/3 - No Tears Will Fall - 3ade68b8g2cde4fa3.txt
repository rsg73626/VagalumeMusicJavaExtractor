NO TEARS WILL FALL

Hold yourselves 
the time is now
you may cry
but still you'll die.
                         (x2)
Listen to me
listen clearly
suffer now
heads down.

The blood in your face may clean
your soul while it corrupt mine
I'll take off your damn eyes while
you sleep peacefully.  

Your head will make a nice trophy (I killed you)
Your words will never affect me  (You annoy me)
Now you could be alive
If you had never disapointed me
but no tears will fall.

I can still remember the day that you left me in the dark.
You said that i can trust you, but these are fake words.

I will never forgive what you've made
for me...

I can hear you
You are screaming
I can see you
See you bleeding

Can't you see
That I believe
That someday
we'll be togheter

Your head will make a nice trophy (I killed you)
Your words will never affect me  (You annoy me)
Now you could be alive
If you had never disapointed me
but no tears will fall.
