YOUR EYES

This moment i wish you'd be there
To hold you tight, and look your eyes (look your eyes)
I can't forget all of those nightmares (all of those nightmares)
My heart is broken into pieces.

I will love you forever
But you don't recognize,
No you

Did you ever wanted to kiss me
Or just a illusion in my dreams (in my dreams)
I can't stop thinking on your smile (on your smile)
You are my love and my denial.

I can remember
Your bright eyes
my love become       (x2)
worst part of me

I will love you forever
But you don't recognize,
No you don't.
