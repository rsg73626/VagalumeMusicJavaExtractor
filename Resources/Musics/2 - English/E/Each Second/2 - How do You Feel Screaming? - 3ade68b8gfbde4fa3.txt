This is the way that i want to

SCREAM!
- - - - - - - - - - - -
(Look at me)
Scream at me 
(Shoot at me)
You're killing me              X2
(Stay around)
So you can be found
(Don't look behind)
I'll leave you blind.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
Please don't make me feel (THIS WAY.)
Give me something new (NO WAY)
GIVE ME SOMETHING                      
You've never gave to me (I WANT)
Don't you believe me (I WILL)
GIVE ME SOMETHING
- - - - - - - - - - - -
(This is the)
Final day
(And i want)
To die alone                  X2
(You let me down) 
Left on the ground
(I'll stand up)
And you'll shut up.

Please don't make me feel (THIS WAY.)
Give me something new (NO WAY)
GIVE ME SOMETHING                      
You've never gave to me (I WANT)
Don't you believe me (I WILL)

(Oh Yeah!!!)
Your crazy lips
Under my hips
(Oh yeah!)
Your litle tongue
Sucking my
(Oh yeah!)
Oh she's getting it all
(oh yeah!)
And I just ignore
(oh yeah!)
That she don't belong
To me no more.

In the end
(I will say)
And I'll beg
(You'll see)
That I'm not
Enemy
(Or a threat)
Believe me
(I will be)
Only yours
