BAD THOUGHTS IN BAD TIMES

Don't know where I am
What is it that I'm dreaming
don't know if it is real
dont't know what can I feel

Time is running and I
I am seeing just lies
If I could know what is
what is real FOR ME

We can
pretend
that it's not taking place
and we
could start it over
a game?
a joke?
or just a bad though?
I just depend on her

There's blood in my hand
redemption and blood spiling
it's like a devil's deal
with blood the pact I seal

We can
pretend
that it's not taking place
and we
could start it over
a game?
a joke?
or just a bad though?
I just depend on her

safely without regret we have no
we don't have time to forget
burning the memories within myself
talking about I just met

It's your fault
I can feel
what I mean to you?
what you're looking at
what you're looking at

We can
pretend
that it's not taking place
and we
could start it over
a game?
a joke?
or just a bad though?
I just depend on her

It's not a game
It's not a joke
It's a bad thought in a bad time
