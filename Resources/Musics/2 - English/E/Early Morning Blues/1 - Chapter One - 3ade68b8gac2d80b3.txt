CHAPTER ONE

I'm not a writer, I'm not a poet
I'm just trying to tell my story the best way I know how
To stumble over my words just like
I'm tripping over my two left feet
But I can say

I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to time where I don't feel so alone and abandoned
And taken advantage of
I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to a time where I feel so alive
And I don't have a care in the world

I'm not a fighter
I'm just a lover trying to get these thoughts
From my head down to my arm
Where they will travel a complex circuitry
A highway leading to my fingers, the pen, and the page
And it will read

I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to time where I don't feel so alone and abandoned
And taken advantage of
I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to a time where I feel so alive
And I don't have a care in the world

Can I bring my black and blue bruised broken body
Back to you?
To mend for me
'Cause I have seen the ugly truths of the world

(I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to time where I don't feel so
I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to a time where I feel so alive)

I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to time where I don't feel so alone and abandoned
And taken advantage of
I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to a time where I feel so alive
And I don't have a care in the world

I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to time where I don't feel so alone and abandoned
And taken advantage of
I wanna go back, wanna go back
Back to a time where I feel so alive
And I don't have a care in the world
