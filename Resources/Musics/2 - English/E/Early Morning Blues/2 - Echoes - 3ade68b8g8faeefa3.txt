ECHOES

This little light of mine, I'm just gonna let it die
'Cause I couldn't bring it back to life no matter how hard I tried.

'Cause it's the days, weeks and months,
how the years have flown by.
It's the blood, sweat, and tears. I've lost so much, I'm fine.
You will echo (echo) and echo
in the back of my mind until the day that I die.

This is my resignation.
This is my call to arms.
This is my stepping stone.
I'm heading out on my own.

But if I sold my soul, then where did all the money go?

'Cause it's the days, weeks and months,
how the years have flown by.
It's the blood, sweat, and tears. I've lost so much, I'm fine.
You will echo(echo) and echo
In the back of my mind until the day that I die.

Echo (echo) and echo

Everything you say sounds the same.
Everything you say, so dull and plain.
Everything you say sounds the same.

This is my resignation.
This is my call to arms.
This is my stepping stone.
I'm heading out on my own.
This is my coronation.
I'll say goodbye to all my friends.
See you all on the other side.
The grass is greener, yea thats right.
