BACKSEAT

[Verse 1]
I've been walking with my drink on empty
My drink on empty, but shit, I'mma fill that cup
I've been smoking with my mind on plenty
My mind on plenty, but shit, I'mma focus up
Yeah, we gon' sweat, Yeah, we gon' work
Yeah, we gon' drink, I jump in head first
My hands are so high, my hands are so big
Just hand me that mic, I'll rock this whole crib

[Hook]
Backseat in the whip, The stereo's yanked
Dismiss the slow flow, The prose so dank
In fifty-two weeks I broke the whole bank
You're talking too loud, I'd hate to pull rank
Take a deep breath, Take a big drink
I'm smoking that stuff that makes me wan' think
I love this whole shit, I'm never gon' stop
I baked it just right, This shit is just hot

[Verse 2]
I got a portrait of myself in the front hall
Reassure me or more, it'll never fall
If it does pick it up like "there he go"
He's on the rise, No surprise, No miracles
Eh yo, Chop Chop Suey
I'm Hong Kong Phooey with this rap shit
Running through this world with my glass on massive
Sipping on something hard enough to put me on my ass
But I'm loving this feeling like I'm hearing them classics
Yeah, we did it, yeah, we done done it
We doing what we love, still keeping it on a hundred
The Two Tone Rebel never fret it, never stunt it
Cuz I'm thinking about change
Not the shit that comes with money and Ohh
I still get it in abundance
That ain't my focus. In focus, that's ugly
In focus, I'm focused, No Hokus no Pokus
Smoke on that dope shit and hope for the hopeless

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Air horns hit the cerebellum like a ton of bricks
86 that bullshit like I'm 46
26 is when I hit with that double F
Plenty stress but never worry I got plenty left
Talk about it like a nuisance, A menace to your health
A menace to subside, no perfection is itself
A stupid contradiction that will never fucking happen
You spilled you chocolate milk, go grab a motha' fucking napkin
Because I'm sick of this shit, my pocket's ready to roll
I've been patient as fuck, I've been paying the tolls
I've been pushing my whip at a reasonable speed
I got Louis the Dog and a chick on her knees
I got one on the floor, I got one on the seat
I got one on the low, I keep one on the leash
But now I'm gonna go get it, Yeah I'm gonna go get it
I said I gotta go get it so I'm gonna go get it

[Hook] (x2)
