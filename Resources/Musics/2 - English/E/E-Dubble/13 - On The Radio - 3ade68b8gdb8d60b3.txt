ON THE RADIO

Back when dj's stillcould play what they wanted
Us lil' tikes didn't carehow hard you stunted
All we wanted was to hear that fresh shit blast
Hit pause on the tape deck if it was trash
Mixtapes were tapes not playlists and
We made em'in real time so makeshift
Wait for the station and grab my tapes

Got my trigger finger ready for the top eight at eight
(Now how the fuck) is this little guy pants still really high
Listening to let me ride by doctor dre
Well I'll tell you, I went and stole my sisters tapes
And they had the tipper sticker so they cursed away

(And ms gore) and dolores tucka please listen up
Intentions were good but you still fucked up
You can't touch up an artform like ours
And you made lil' e-dub want to spit bars
Go hard!

You listen to it twice 'cause the dj was asleep
Uh uh uh on the radio!
(We all wanna be)
On the radio!
(We all wanna be)
On the radio!
(We all wanna be)
On the radio!
(And I wanna be)
On the radio!

On that jambox, turn that jam up
That's me mo'fucker so just put your hands up
Toast those jazzers, we aren't average
We can make magic, we are young mavericks
We can warch labyrinth debate david bowie
And talk about how the song in the movie

Is a poem and this is poetry, and we roll with these
Punches and minutes and days until its over we
Won't stop until the last breath
And this music keeps us human till death
A four chord progression so def that
A tear slips out your eye and your left
Breathless, relentless unkempt
But you feel so free those words were unsaid
Yeah, e-mails were unsent
And for 3 good minutes you ditched that regret
'Cause you!

You listen to it twice 'cause the dj was asleep
Uh uh uh on the radio!
(We all wanna be)
On the radio!
(We all wanna be)
On the radio!
(We all wanna be)
On the radio!
(And I wanna be)
On the radio!
