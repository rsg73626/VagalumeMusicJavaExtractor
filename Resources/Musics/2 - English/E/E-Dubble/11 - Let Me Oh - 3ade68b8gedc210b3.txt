LET ME OH

Chorus: 
That clock keeps tickin' like a metronome. 
And my thoughts keep tellin' me to get me home 
But my balls keep tellin' me to let me ohh 
Oh- just let me ohh 

That clock keeps tickin' like a metronome. 
And my thoughts keep tellin' me to get me home 
But my balls keep tellin' me to let me ohh 
Oh- just let me ohh 

That clock keeps tickin' like a metronome. 
And my thoughts keep tellin' me to get me home 
But my balls keep tellin' me to let me ohh 
Fuck all that shit just let me go

Verse 1: 
Ohhers and tastemakers, makers no chaser 
Gets the blood flowing like a fuckin' pacemaker 
Cut the middleman and inhale the vapors 
Mad men (ha ha) oh ten don drapers 

Cut the jukebox on make sure the woofers blow, blow 
We gon' sit here until them heffers go, go 
Holler at the tens, then spend a little dough 
Not on them, no, they can buy their own drinks ohhhh 

Work week's done off, 5 days in the bucket 
Fuck it, you got a boss who's a jerk who doesn't? 
Throw on some wu-tang bring the mothafuckin' ruckus 
There is no pretext we are living and we love it 

On a budget nevermind, we just nudge it to the side 
Give the kids a little time we are living till' we die 
We are focused and we hustle but we still be getting high 
No exception to the rule do what you do to get by cuz' 

Chorus: 
That clock keeps tickin' like a metronome. 
And my thoughts keep tellin' me to get me home 
But my balls keep tellin' me to let me ohh 
Oh- just let me ohh 

That clock keeps tickin' like a metronome. 
And my thoughts keep tellin' me to get me home 
But my balls keep tellin' me to let me ohh 
Oh- just let me ohh 

That clock keeps tickin' like a metronome. 
And my thoughts keep tellin' me to get me home 
But my balls keep tellin' me to let me ohh 
Fuck all that shit just let me go

Verse 2: 
At a house party gettin' jammed up 
You are tony danza 
When they ask whose the fuckin' boss, put your hand up 
Never put it down cuz' you're banging to the anthem 

2010 Trend put the I-pod on random 
Wonder why it tried to play this instead of hanson 
Probably cuz' it gets the people moving like a handgun 
Just like the little white fellas up in hampden 
Happy easter from the mothafuckas in the mansion
