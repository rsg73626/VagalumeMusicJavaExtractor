GREEN LIGHTS (FREESTYLE FRIDAY #30)

Verse 1
Quixotic thoughts are not modest
But big dreams seem the theme to my wattage
So bright the beams are my cottage
At home with the 100 watts so don't dodge it
Pro libertate compadre
We need freedom all day and always
No congestion mucinex beckoned
Fuck 83 I'm on the old Fallsway
That's the scenic route for those lamen to
The hot route through the four one Eww
Oh he did again what you gon' do
The cliche more played than the blue man group
I never tried to be played cuz' it seemed uncool
Self promotion's pulling teeth for me without those tools
But I figured out a way to brave those doubting fools
With a hand up I manned up and dropped them jewels
With the deuces up high for my ever loving posse
Can't explain the love I have knowing yall behind me
YE- one of these days we'll hit Hawaii
Head west like YE West no more Why E?
No more questions, no more guessing
On why we split, real life takes time
Wnd we didn't have enough of it
Since then I've been roughin' it
Soon enough we'll be back and we'll have a great time like Yeah!

Chorus
Talk about it now
Cuz' they keep pullin' us down
But I ain't stoppin'
Cuz' all I see are green lights
And even when I'm wrong I mean right
Please believe I
Know I'm gonna need to revise
But this life don't give retries
So I'm on it
And up at the break of dawn
Workin' hard just to shake the yawns
Talk about it now

Verse 2
Cuz' they keep pullin' us down
But I ain't stoppin'
Cuz' all I see are green lights
And e
All i wanna do is buy brunch for my friends
And cop my mom a B-M-Dub
But right now I'm quite broke for the sacrifice
So trust me I send this with love
So talk about it now
The whole world plagued with ailments
And I just eat my trailmix
Unconvinced about the who, what, where and how
And why life's like one big tailspin
No more pale shit, the color commentary is bright
And with yall help I'll get right
My pops told me that he loves that I'm on my dream
And goddamn that shit felt nice
So I ain't stoppin' shit
Therapy when I cut to the chase
And with me you get no red tape
There's no barricade between you, me and all of this music
If you gotta still hate then hate
Whatever gets you through
But I'm on it, sip the saint pauli
Call me an alki fuck it yall corny
Pop tops off the christians get ornery
Recognize the good for good and stay off me
lay off the hate yall, I'll never be drake
Whoever try to say otherwise is utterly baked
Put my life in every line and that ain't up for debate
Here's a toast to everybody tryna' find their way
So let's go

Chorus
Talk about it now
Cuz' they keep pullin' us down
But I ain't stoppin'
Cuz' all I see are green lights
And even when I'm wrong I mean right
Please believe I
Know I'm gonna need to revise
But this life don't give retries
So I'm on it
And up at the break of dawn
Workin' hard just to shake the yawns
Talk about it now
