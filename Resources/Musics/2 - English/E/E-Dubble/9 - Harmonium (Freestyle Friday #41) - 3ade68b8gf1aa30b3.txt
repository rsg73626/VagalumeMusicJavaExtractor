HARMONIUM (FREESTYLE FRIDAY #41)

Verse 1
Clarity is nothing when you keep your eyes closed
But reality is bleak so clarity is my foe
Twenty fifteen on my vision if it goes
Still thinking I'd be fine cuz' music's in my soul
Hearing aid be damned, I better hear my band
Plug one, plug two - feedback's my jam
I know I ain't dead when them levels start peaking
And I never played Kansas and I'm tryna hit Topeka
Fuck it I know I'll hit it
Snappin' a bunch of pictures
Hipstmatic on the mattress the passionate don't need lipstick
and neither dos my dick but he really hates the glitter shit
Waking up to find he's the tittle of a twitter pic
Never live it down, cuz we only live it up
When the band wagon's full we'll just get a bigger bus
Load that shit up with some kegs in the trunk
By the time we hit DC we need to re-up
Tryin' to keep it movin', head above the watter still
Ain't been home in months, forgot to pay the watter bill
Gained a few pounds, blame it on the watter weight
Lost a few friends and it took a part of me
Ashame how you only see the change from a distance
But don't close shop you're giving them the business

Chorus
We living too fast, we never pump breaks
We shooting for the stars but they always get away
We gonna take charge, we never gonna hate
All we wanna do is build take it to another phase
On another level where we never gonna budge
And we want our paperback so you can go ahead and judge
Never cover up, we are doing what we love
Never wanna reach the finish cuz' we having too much fun

Verse 2
Wheels keep turning we tryna move it out
The old way wasn't workin' so we threw it out
Bumps in the road but we gon' smooth it out
Through our vices this life is priceless no doubt
Even through the hardships we ain't taking no shorts
No beg your pardons when you bet on our horse
Awkward little thing but you know we raise the stakes
And when we hit the finish line we just find another race
Tryna find the positive and shit upon the negative
I'm sick of people being complacent with just the way it is
And I ain't talkin' politics cuz' that facade is paper thin
I'm talking bout the spirit inside of us that can make us win
I've been trying to win for a minute now I'm in it
Thicker than a lick-a-made stick gripped between your digits
go head and enjoy joy, i'm hollerin' oi oi
Cuz' i'll be fuckin' dead before I stop making noise boy
Uh- teddy rukspin my music's from my guts
And every week I get a chance to keep from going nuts
I'm sick of all the ordinary
And I've been more than ready
To put the fucking status quo inside the mortuary
Close the door and then step into the sunshine
Cuz' I ain't slowing down if I only get one try

Chorus
We living too fast, we never pump breaks
We shooting for the stars but they always get away
We gonna take charge, we never gonna hate
All we wanna do is build take it to another phase
On another level where we never gonna budge
And we want our paperback so you can go ahead and judge
Never cover up, we are doing what we love
Never wanna reach the finish cuz' we having too much fun
