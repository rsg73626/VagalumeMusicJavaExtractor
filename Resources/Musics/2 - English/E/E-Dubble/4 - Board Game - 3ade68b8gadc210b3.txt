BOARD GAME

Chorus: 
My life's a board game, but I'm never bored mayne 
I lose my keys, then I'll just smash in through the door frame 
I'm writing stories while I'm living' life in real time 
I'm fightin' for the glory even' tho it's undefined- 
Stop plagarizin' all my shit 
I just made another lane and I done paved that shit 
Put a hammer to the game and rearrange that bitch 
You need to feel a little pain so you can tame that shit

Verse 1: 
When we fall for shit, we fall hard for it 
Caution to the wind and I'm off again 
Bargain bin sale for the band aids 
Better buy bulk cuz' I'll rip skin off again 
No doubt, never stop with the scrapes and skids 
Feels like I just been raking in shit 
This ain't money and it sure ain't fun 
And it feels like I been bathing in piss 
No golden shower this the hour 
We stand up tall like a fuckin' tower 
And get so hard these fuckers back down 
None of us even had to pop cialis 

Take 2 sips from the pimpin' chalice 
Wonderland sans that trip with alice 
Walkin' hard so my feet get calloused 
More pain than pleasure but we'll find a balance 
I'll tip my cap to those people that 
Can put 25 different things on their back 
And still toe the line and keep on tr ack 
Disciplined passion hate on that 
No white towels, have to wait on that 
Stronger than them put some weight on that 
And I'll never get rusty but if I do 
I have pabs help me go and throw some paint on that

Chorus: 
My life's a board game, but I'm never bored mayne 
I lose my keys, then I'll just smash in through the door frame 
I'm writing stories while I'm living' life in real time 
I'm fightin' for the glory even' tho it's undefined- 
Stop plagarizin' all my shit 
I just made another lane and I done paved that shit 
Put a hammer to the game and rearrange that bitch 
You need to feel a little pain so you can tame that shit

Verse 2: 
Board games and mortar paste 
My mind's more cluttered than a hoarder's basement 
I'm about to clean house, figure out how to go about 
Selling these mind erasers 
Time is wasted when I am wasted 
But I keep thinkin' bout the time and place 
When I get to go grind and sip mai thais 
All at the same time and avoid the shakes 
Find the pace, shake the hate 
I'm a dirty guerilla no bathing ape 
Keep your style I'll abuse all the substance 
Bath in wine- while you squash the grapes 

I'm draped up and dripped out 
My verses get shit out 
I write so fast, that the ink can't dry 
My keyboard's my friend now 
And fuck yeah I been down- but now I'm gon' stand up 
The blackhawks may have won but p town knows what's up 
I'm in the b but I'm from the p 
And I'm workin' on repping that dmv 
Dont' bother lookin' for me on your tv 
They want the free, but don't love the speech

Chorus: 
My life's a board game, but I'm never bored mayne 
I lose my keys, then I'll just smash in through the door frame 
I'm writing stories while I'm living' life in real time 
I'm fightin' for the glory even' tho it's undefined- 
Stop plagarizin' all my shit 
I just made another lane and I done paved that shit 
Put a hammer to the game and rearrange that bitch 
You need to feel a little pain so you can tame that shit
