FEAR

I hear your steps approching me
You take control, it's got to be
My heart is thumping and
I feel such fear, fear

My thoughts have fallen in your hands
My blood it freezes in my veins
I lose my senses 'cause
I feel such fear, fear

Leave me, my head is gonna break
I hate the violence of your back
Your eyes are full of fire
I feel such fear, fear

Your strenght is penetrating me
I hate your queer brutality
I'm going mad, I feel
I feel such fear, fear

Far away images of my past
Flashing in my mind so very fast
The face of a woman fades away
I feel such fear, fear

Now you stroke my beaten skin
Stifling the pangs of my all my pain
You've hurt me such a lot and
I feel such fear, fear

Strange sensations shake my soul
A feeling of a fault shuts my throat
Now it's all over but
I feel such fear, fear

You smile enjoing the victory
I'm just a prisoner of destiny
My life is changing and
I feel such fear, fear

(You take control)
(You take control, it's got to be)
(You take control)
(You take control, it's got to be)

Far away images of my past
Flashing in my mind so very fast
The face of a woman fades away
I feel such fear, fear

Now you stroke my beaten skin
Stifling the pangs of my all my pain
You've hurt me such a lot and
I feel such fear, fear

Strange sensations shake my soul
A feeling of a fault shuts my throat
Now it's all over but
I feel such fear, fear

You smile enjoing the victory
I'm just a prisoner of destiny
My life is changing and
I feel such fear, fear
Fear, fear
Fear, fear
Fear, fear
I feel such fear, fear
Fear, fear

(You take control)
(You take control, it's got to be)
(You take control)
(You take control, it's got to be)
