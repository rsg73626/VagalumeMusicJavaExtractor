DOGMA

It's easier to act as a clown
and pretend to know nothing
Although I want you to hold your hand
won't look back on your
feelings

I cover the happiness's skin
and turn around to everyone
l can't be nice
or hold anyone in my arms anymore

I borrowed someone's words
and forced myself to repaint my
feelings
I suddenly had no idea of my true self
Even in solitude, I continue to deceive myself

Let me sleep
Let me sleep in the darkness tonight
If repentance is all pardon
Let me sleep in the darkness tonight

Video of my childhood
The other side of the screen
my mother called my name
A voice that was kind and genuine
Tighten me now

Tighten me now
