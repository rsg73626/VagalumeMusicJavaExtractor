WINTERFELL

I felt as if I was falling in darkness and stifling
I am wandering around looking for a guidepost
A broken fragmentmelts away like snow if
I try to save it by hand and it wets my palm
Your whisper tempts me
I decided to believe the voice
A thread of white light that emerged
from all of the endless possibilities
The wind carries a fragrance
and tells the turn of the season
A scene wavering in the depths of my heart
It's a scene from the day when it did not come true

Something frozen in my heart now begins to melt
and is going to reveal it
Emotions are scattered to all directions
And they cuddle everything around them warmly
sometimes hotly

If feelings are visible
I want to lock them in a box right now
Would they then strain to break free
or just give in?

A cold wind stops my means of transportation
and takes my hand
It makes my senses fail
and is going to take consciousness away
"I should not be here"
I kept walking in darkness while persuading myself
Don't take your eyes off this sea
