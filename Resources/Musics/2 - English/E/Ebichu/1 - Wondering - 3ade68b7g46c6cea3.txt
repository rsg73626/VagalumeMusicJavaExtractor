WONDERING

Wondering
I'm home alone again today
Housekeeping

When suddenly, I think of you
I cannot for the life of me
Figure out you men

Do whatever you want, whenever you want (chu chu chu)
If you had to grow up (la la la)
Wha-Whatever would you do?!

You didn't cause any trouble today
Thank God!
Tonight's full moon
Makes her miss you

Anyway, for now, I sit here wondering
sound of stomach growling
Boy, am I ever hungry!
