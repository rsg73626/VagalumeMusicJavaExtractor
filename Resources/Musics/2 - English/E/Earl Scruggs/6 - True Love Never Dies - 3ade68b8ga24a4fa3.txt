TRUE LOVE NEVER DIES

The last time I thought about leavin',
Was the last time I made her cry.
I talked myself out of believin',
That true, true love never dies.
The first time I thought of returnin',
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town.
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a-turnin',
Yeah, there was nothin' on this earth gonna shut me down.

But if I had one drop of water,
For each and every tear that I have cried.
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow.
True, true love never dies.

Well, the fires of anger turn to ashes,
Your pride will forsake you by and by.
The lonesome is not surely passin',
That ol' true, true love never dies.

But if I had one drop of water,
For each and every tear that I have cried.
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow.
True, true love never dies.

No, it never does.

Well, if I had one drop of water,
For each and every tear that I have cried.
Well, I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow.
True, true love never dies.

Well, I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow.
True, true love never dies.

It never dies.

It never does.
No, No, No.

True true love.
True true love.
True true love.
