MY HOME'S ACROSS THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS

My home's across the Blue Ridge Mountains
My home's across the Blue Ridge Mountains
My home's across the Blue Ridge Mountains
And I never expect to see you anymore

Gonna leave you Sunday morning
Gonna leave you Sunday morning
Gonna leave you Sunday morning
And I never expect to see you anymore

My home's across the Blue Ridge Mountains...
[ banjo ]
How can I keep from crying
How can I keep from crying
How can I keep from crying
I never expect to see you anymore

My home's across the Blue Ridge Mountains...
[ guitar ]
Goodbye my little Nashville darling
Goodbye my little Nashville darling
Goodbye my little Nashville darling
But I don't expect to see you anymore

My home's across the Blue Ridge Mountains...
