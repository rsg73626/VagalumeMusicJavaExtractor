MONSTER

Oh, c'est la vie
thats the way it is my friend
nothing is for free
the day that high school ends

Life is a monster
is this all in vain?
Life is a monster
please spare me from the pain

Why am I so clumbsy?
she thinks I'm a fool I fear
now I'm swimming not through sorrow
but in a sea made up of tears

Life is a monster
burning in your brain
life is a monster
why is she so vain?

When I saw you for the first time
you were cold and I was scared
now I see you for the last time
and I can't get you out of my head
get out of my head
