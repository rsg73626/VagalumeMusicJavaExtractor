CALI X

Riding down on highway 101
I'm trying to make it home before the sun
Was down on my luck but now I'm
On the rise and I
See the city lights on the horizon

We're gona have a good time, don't be so serious
Open up your mind for california experience
From the golden gate to la
San diego to san jose

Now I'm riding down on 17
I'm going to the farm where they grow christmas trees
It's january and still the leaves look so green
This is where I go where I go to get my
Cali weed, my cali needs, my cali dreams

We're gona have a good time, don't be so serious
Open up your lungs for california experience
From santa cruz to yosemite
Humboldt count to death valley

Now I'm riding up pacheco pass
Past a dried up lake with an empty tank of gas
Cruzin high
Interstate 5
Keep on pushing on through the grapevine, right!

We're gona have a good time, don't be so serious
Open up your hearts for california experience
From tijuana to tahoe
Monterey hasta fresno

We're gona have a good time, don't be so furious
Open up your love for california experience
In any different time zone
To all my homies smoking blunts around the globe smoke 2 more!
