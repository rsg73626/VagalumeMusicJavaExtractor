FEELIN IRIE

Wake up in the morn
Face down on the floor
And I'm thinking to myself I can't do this anymore
Well I'm back at it again
Drinking with my friends
It's another tuesday night the party's never gona end
Now I'm back out on the prowl
Following a crowd
When I hear some reggae music coming from the other house
So I pick myself up
Roll up another blunt
Head over to the party cuz it's time to have some fun

I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie so don't you bring me down now

I'm seeing things out the corner of my eye
The room begins to spin it should come as no surprise
Cuz I popped a couple pills, had a few too many drinks
It's time to level off so I'm searching for my weed
Now I'm back out on the road
Trying to make it home
When I see the black and white creeping under the moonlight
I see the blue and reds
And I start thinking in my head
Don't stop don't stop oh no no

I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie so don't you bring me down now

I said hello there mr. policeman I'm wondering
Just what you're doing with that gun in your hand
I been walking the street minding my own business
Now you come to pay me a visit tell me officer why you trippin
You said you see me in the wrong neighborhood
Caught me with my blunt and my pipe think it's all understood
Well I'm feeling fine, I'm feelin high just look in my eyes
You're gona find I'm legalized!

I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie so don't you bring me down now

I'm looking up
The sun is shining
Living the good life
Positive minded
Smoking a sensi
Has got me smiling
For I'm a man of peace and not a man of violence
Yet I'm irie
With the vibrance of love
Using humbleness as my crutch
Im just a simple man in this land trying to enjoy life
Feelin irie's not a privilege it's a right!

I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie
I'm feelin irie so don't you bring me down now

Don't you bring me down now x 4
