NOW AND THEN

Back in the day when we used to say
Let's hit the beach up and just waste away
Soak in the rays and ride out the waves
This is how we'd spend our summer school days
I won?t give up, give up, give up, give up
Now that there's so much more at stake
Big up, big up, big up, big up
To all the friends that we made along the way?

Remember now and then
Smoking spliffs to the Bob Marley (Bob Marley)
We pick up a guitar 'cause it's our calling (Our Calling)
Knock a beat and start freestyling (Freestyling)
Ain't no need to worry 'cause I'll catch you if you start falling...x2

Cruising down vista del mar
Stop at the cannabis club it's not too far
Check out who's playing down at local reggae night
And if you're feeling alright baby then let's dance away the night
I won't give up, give up, give up, give up
Now that there's so much more at stake
Big up, big up, big up, big up
To all the love that we found along the way?

Remember now and then
Smoking spliffs to the Bob Marley (Bob Marley)
We pick up a guitar ?cause it?s our calling (Our Calling)
Knock a beat and start freestyling (Freestyling)
Ain't no need to worry 
'cause I'll catch you if you start falling ?x 2

Remember the sunny days walking up the street
Smiling at all the passing lady's looking so pretty
Lok'd out smoke clouds Og kush and blueberry
Road trips, kick flips, and bonfires on the beach
I won't give up, give up, give up, give up
Now that there's so much more at stake
Big up, big up, big up, big up
To all the love that we found along the way?

Remember now and then
Smoking spliffs to the Bob Marley (Bob Marley)
We pick up a guitar 'cause it's our calling (Our Calling)
Knock a beat and start freestyling (Freestyling)
Ain't no need to worry 'cause 
I'll catch you if you start falling x2
Catch you if you start falling x3
