SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY

I can't sleep
No I can't close my eyes
You're all I see, you're all I'm thinking of
I felt so lucky
When I had you there next to me
Now I must wait for my luck to change

I don't wana listen to the radio
It plays all of our favorite tunes
And they all remind me of you
Sooner or later I'm gona have to stop and face the music
Just ain't been the same since you've been away

Now that you're gone
I find harder to carry on
Keep my feet on the ground, head up in the clouds
Everywhere I turn
The fire in my heart still burns
Don't wana be alone baby please come back home

I don't wana listen to the radio
It plays all of our favorite tunes
And they all remind me of you
Sooner or later I'm gona have to stop and face the music
Just ain't been the same since you've been away...x2
