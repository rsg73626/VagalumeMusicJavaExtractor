WITH YOU

Can't no one take way this moment right now
Under the moon and stars we find time to unwind
See the smoke from the fire rise up in the air
Light another spliff and watch the smoke rings disappear
No there ain't no way I'd rather be anywhere but here

Let your head rest upon my chest as you listen to my heart beat
Lay to rest all your thoughts uncertain
No need for words when I can feel

When I'm with you
Things could be a little easier
With you
Time slipping by but it moves so slow
With you
Things could be a little easier
With you

It's so easy to forget the pain and the stress
That's turning me upside down
When I look into your eyes
Know things will be alright
We gona make it if we try
Keep on holding me tight and
Don't let go, till we see the sun rising
Over the ocean girl we'll keep on flying
Don't say no, till we see the sun rising
Over the mountains girl let's keep on climbing

Let your head rest upon my chest as you listen to my heart beat
Lay to rest all your thoughts uncertain
No need for words when I can feel, oh oh the way I feel

When I'm with you
Things could be a little easier
With you
Time slipping by but it moves so slow
With you
Things could be a little easier
With you (repeat)
