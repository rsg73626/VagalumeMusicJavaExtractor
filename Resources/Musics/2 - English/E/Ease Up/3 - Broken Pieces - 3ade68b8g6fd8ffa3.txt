BROKEN PIECES

I?ve been waiting for you lately
But are you the one that?s gona save me?...........x 4

Now and again,
I know that I?d call you my friend
But are you really gona play me tonight
?cause I?ve been waiting here for you
You said that you were gona call soon
Well now I?m playing all by myself and I don?t need your help

I?ve been waiting for you lately
But are you the one that?s gona save me?...........x 4

Now it?s the afternoon and I was feeling so good
Went out that?s when I saw you walking through my neighborhood
Wonderin? if I should just go on and give my heart a chance
Spring is in the air and your love is in demand
I?ll supply all you need and in a week you?ll say it?s over
But look at who I see that?s coming over my shoulder
Tell me that you?ve changed now that you?ve grown a little older
Next thing I know she?s gone, she?s gone saying?

There?s no hope for us tomorrow
My thoughts have drifted way and so my heart must follow
And should our paths cross again one day
I?ll pick up the broken pieces and I?ll look right into you?re eyes and say

I?ve been waiting for you lately (lady, baby, etc.)
But are you the one that?s gona save me?...........x 4

There?s no hope for us tomorrow
My thoughts have drifted way and so my heart must follow
And should our paths cross again one day
I?ll pick up the broken pieces and I?ll say
