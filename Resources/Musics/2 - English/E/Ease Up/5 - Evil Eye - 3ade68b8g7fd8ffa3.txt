EVIL EYE

Hey there girl let's go out for the weekend
Come monday morning you know I'm gona be leaving
If you only knew the sadness I've been feeling
Maybe then you won't give that evil eye girl

Don't give me no evil eye girl
Don't give me no evil eye oh no
Don't give me no evil eye no more

Mama said I ain't got to leave yet
Papa said I'd have to go eventually though
See you standing in the corner know you're crying
Oh don't you know that inside Im dying

Don't give me no evil eye girl
Don't give me no evil eye oh no
Don't give me no evil eye no more

Oh she said that she likes my smile
She said she likes the way I rock my style
She say she love me 'cause I'm so original
But say she won't be loving me when 
I head out of the door no oh

There ain't nothing new in this world girl
I ain't doing nothing that ain't been done before so
This spliff right here's for me and yes for you girl
Come on and take this little trip around the world but don't ya

Don't give me no evil eye girl
Don't give me no evil eye oh no
Don't give me no evil eye no more.x2
