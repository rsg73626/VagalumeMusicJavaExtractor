IF YOU ONLY KNEW

If you?
Only knew how much you mean to me
If you?
Only knew how much I love you?x 2

Now I can think of the first time when you shook me up
Gazed into your eyes want to make you mine
I can't get enough
Soon as you got me falling head over heels
I thought to myself yeah I?ve found something real
Well it wasn?t long before I was gone and we grew apart
Singing along to all the same songs, never got too far
Seemed like the further we drifted away the closer we became
I?m so happy so thankful it?s you here with me today

If you?
Only knew how much you mean to me
If you?
Only knew how much I love you?x 2

You're the one that keeps me grounded when I'm feeling lost
Picking me up when I'm feeling down and my timing's off
Always been there through thick and thin
Going round in circles and now we're back here again
I know you got my back and know that I got yours
Gona get you anything you ask for, and then some more
Oh it seemed the further we drifted away the closer we became
And I feel so happy so thankful it's you here with me today

If you?
Only knew how much you mean to me
If you?
Only knew how much I love you?x 2
