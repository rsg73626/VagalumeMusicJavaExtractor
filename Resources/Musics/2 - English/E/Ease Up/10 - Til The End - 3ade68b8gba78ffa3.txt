TIL THE END

How long will it take me
Before I right the wrongs
And even if you hate me
All I got for you is love sweet love

I feel the fire burning and I don't wana let go, no no no
Living is about learning to navigate across the tight rope, 
oh oh oh
Look before you leap my friend
And I'll be here for you until the end
Till the End

Won't let the pressure break me
I got to stand strong
And you can try to change me
But if I was you I wouldn't push my luck

I feel the fire burning and I don't wana let go, no no no
Living is about learning to navigate across the tight rope, 
oh oh oh
Look before you leap my friend
And I'll be here for you until the end
Till the End

When the river runs dry
And troubles keep turning me up over my head
When I'm trying to Fly
But the embers keep burning
When the road gets dark and I can't see no exit signs
Keep following paths I never tread before
Always wanted more
I just can't keep it inside

I feel the fire burning and I don't wana let go, no no no
Living is about learning to navigate across the windy roads, 
oh oh oh
Look before you leap my friend
And I'll be here for you until the end
But it's not the end, no oh oh

I feel the fire burning and I don't wana let go, no no no
Living is about learning to navigate across the windy roads, 
oh oh oh
Look before you leap my friend
And I'll be here for you until the end
Till the End
