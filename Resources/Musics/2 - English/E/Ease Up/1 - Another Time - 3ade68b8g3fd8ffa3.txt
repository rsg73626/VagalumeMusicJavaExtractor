ANOTHER TIME

In another time
Or in a different place
It would be much easier to do, easier to say
In another time
Or in a different place
It would be much easier for you, easier for me

Oh little darling told me she loved me from the start
Her love fills up the cup of my heart
So let it over flow
Saturate my life you satisfy my soul
Now you got me feelin right
On a lazy afternoon
Can't make it out my room
Every time I turn around I wish that it was you girl

Although my heavy heart can weigh me down
I know it's just for now, for now
Tomorrow brings a brighter day
I'll keep my head up high, won't drown in my sorrow no

In another time
Or in a different place
It would be much easier to do, easier to say
In another time
Or in a different place
It would be much easier for you, easier for me

Oh little darling told me that I'm the one she needs
And she's the one for me, ya right!
So take my hand
Hold me tight and don't let go
We'll change up our plans
And run away to mexico
Where our bodies we can reach drink tequila on the beach
I wake up in the morning and realize it's just a dream oh

Although my heavy heart can weigh me down
I know it's just for now, for now
Tomorrow brings a brighter day
I'll keep my head up high, won't drown in my sorrow no no

In another time
Or in a different place
It would be much easier to do, easier to say
In another time
Or in a different place
It would be much easier for you, easier for me x 3
