BEAUTIFUL DISTRACTION

why would you take these things away from me? 
why do you seem to have nothing to say to me? 
i know if i were you then i'd speak volumes. 
it only scares me more when you say nothing.

so open up your mouth and tell me something 
that i don't expect to hear.

hey now don't you see this changes everything? 
maybe there could be a happy ending. 
i hope my eyes don't show that desperation. 
can you tell that i'm new to this situation?

so i'll close my eyes and focus, 
send out a thank you to whoever brought you here.

i can't look at you because you're perfect. 
it should be a privilege, and i'm not worth it. 
i wish i could hide you from the world. 
tell everybody near that you're my girl.

you're a beautiful distraction from the gray world that i live in. 
i don't know where i go from here, 
i'd do anything to not wake up.

i don't want to wake up.
