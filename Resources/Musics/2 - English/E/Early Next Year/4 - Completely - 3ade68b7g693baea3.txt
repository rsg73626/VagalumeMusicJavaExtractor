COMPLETELY

hey there _____, girl what you do to me, 
i just can't believe. 
i'm starting to think you don't know that i'm alive, 
cause you don't write.

i'm writing you another letter, 
put it with the others. 
i've read you're just over twenty, 
you're perfect for me.

i saw your new movie. it moved me completely. 
you're the best i've ever seen, 
you frequent my dreams, 
one day i know that i'll take you home with me.

i would do anything to call you, 
to hear that voice of yours. 
your lips would form the words i hear from you, 
so speak the truth.

hey _____ you're beautiful, 
i've watched you so much that i feel like i know you. 
i've noticed once or twice, the way you kiss on screen, 
and i keep on holding out hope the next guy will be me.
