SAY HELLO

I'll wear away the boards on this balcony. 
I can't stop myself from pacing. 
I need a little human contact 
to keep my mind from racing. 

Tired of feeling so numb. 
They all say it's cause I'm young. 
I can't undo the things that I've done. 
Living, coping. 
I signed this verbal contract, 
I want to take what I can't take back. 
Now I wish myself all the best. 
Moving slowly.

Say Hello to the unavoidable, 
inescapable truth you've been supressing, 
it's so depressing to watch you 
bent out of shape if you can't change your mind soon, 
then everything they said will just come true.

Another day of sun, sweat, and apathy. 
Clearly and antique routine. 
My life's planned out to the second hand. 
Let's see what this does to me.

Try hard to please everyone. 
How long til I say I'm done? 
You know it's been a good run. 
On your own now.

Can't hide the words on my mind, 
so I'll say them for a third time. 
Our hearts are here on the line. 
Beating slowly.

Say Hello to the unavoidable, 
inescapable truth you've been supressing, 
it's so depressing to watch you 
bent out of shape if you can't change your mind soon, 
then everything they said will just come true.

Can you repeat to me the words 
you said when you were sleeping?
You were out cold, or so I'm told. 
It's all too convenient. 
So if this is the way that you want it to be, 
go decide for yourself, 
don't bother asking me. 
So if this is the way that you want it to be, 
don't bother asking, 
don't bother asking me.
