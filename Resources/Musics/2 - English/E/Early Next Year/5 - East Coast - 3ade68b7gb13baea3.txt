EAST COAST

i don't remember the last time that i saw your face. 
it's been at least a year or two, 
i know we've both changed. 
but now it's time to make amends.

i know that you don't hate me anymore. 
i'm not the same guy that i was before. 
come out see the one that you need most, 
i'll be here waiting on the east coast.

life was calling, so i moved far away, 
that place was killing. you hated i left, 
but i just couldn't stay. i was suffocating. 
but this time you made a mess.

take a train, take a plane, 
just get here soon cause i'm going insane. 
come see me, we'll end this dance, 
you owe me a second chance.
