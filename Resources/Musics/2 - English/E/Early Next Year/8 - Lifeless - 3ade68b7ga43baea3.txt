LIFELESS

Please tell me if you are leaving so I can shut the door behind you now. 
All of these things that you are feeling, 
I'll feel them too if you stay and show me how. 
How to be so cold and heartless, 
I don't know how you live like this. 
Where's the girl that I remember? Cause I need her now.

You know, you know, you know... 
you know you've got to.
Let go, let go... 
of what you're holding on to.
Move on, move on, move on... 
you know you've got to.
Before, before, before... 
before it kills you.

I can't tell if you are breathing, 
you're acting lifeless as of late. 
I'll go wait now in the bedroom, 
make a list of everything you hate. 
See if I made your number one, 
at least you're giving me attention. 
Where's the girl that I remember? Cause I need her now.

Don't mind me, I'm leaving. 
I'll see you in the morning. 
Don't mind me, I'm leaving.
Lucky for you I believe in second chances, 
even when it comes down to these stupid romances and I've got my world revolving around you.
Where's the girl that I remember? Cause I need her.
