GIRL LIKE HER

She's a girl from jersey and she's lovely.
She's got me thinking about her constantly.
I like the way she does her hair and makeup.
Should take a picture cause i just can't get enough.

But i know i could never have that girl,
Cause i have low self-esteem,
And i know that a girl like her,
Would never want a guy like me.

My friends all say "stop being down on yourself,
You'll find a girl someday who wants you and
Nobody else" my friends all say
"stop being down on yourself, you'll be happy again,
You owe it to yourself."

Think i saw her at the show last sunday.
Think she might have even looked my way.
I watched her dancing in the crowd.
But when the show was over she wasn't around.

I don't know how many times i looked for you,
But you were never around.
I looked at all the clubs and all the shows,
Every venue in this town. but now i see you,
Now i'm with you, and there's nothing more to be said.
I guess in the future i'll put a bit more faith in my friends.
