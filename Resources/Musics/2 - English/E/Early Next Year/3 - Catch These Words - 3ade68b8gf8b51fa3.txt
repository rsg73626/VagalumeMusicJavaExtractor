CATCH THESE WORDS

Wait, Wait. 
I need somebody's ear right now, 
to catch these words as they come out my mouth. 
Don't go, 
I need a voice of reason now, 
it's clear that I can't do this by myself.

I'm spread thin. 
I'm spread thinner than I already am. 
I know it sounds impossible. 
But now I walk the line between indifference and the solitary life. 
The same on that I miss.

But lately we are feeling 
a little down and out. 
You know my head is on the floor and 
my feet are on the ceiling.

You know it's hard to admit that 
I'm in over my head. 
It's just never fun losing 
something that I had.

Wait, Wait. 
I need somebody's ear right now, 
to catch these words as they come out my mouth. 
Don't go, 
I need a voice of reason now,
it's clear that I can't do this by myself.

I'm losing. 
I'm losing everything that I have cared about. 
I know it sounds so overkill. 
But now it's time for me to face the issues and a promise to step back 
to get a clearer view.

The mornings when we're waking. 
The moments that we're taking it. 
Just a minute to acknowledge 
all the promises we're making.

But sometimes in life we forget our priorities. Everyone has their own personal histories. Bound by our words, but never our memories.
