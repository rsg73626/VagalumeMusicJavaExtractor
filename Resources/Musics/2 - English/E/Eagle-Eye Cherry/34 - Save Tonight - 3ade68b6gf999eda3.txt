SAVE TONIGHT

Go on and close the curtains
'cause all we need is candle light
You and me and the bottle of wine
gonna hold you tonight

Well, we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
so take this wine and drink with me
let's delay our misery...

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone(2x)

There's a log on the fire
and it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire..
to take me away

It ain't easy to say goodbye
darling please don't start to cry
'cause girl you know I've got to go
and Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
but girl you know I've got to go, oh
and Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
