SOMETHING

Find out what I would want
With out any whiskey
I'm at a loss of words
Cause I was on my way
I wanted to be you
Now I regret that day

Something special has come and gone
I waited too long…I waited too long
The reason I missed the setting sun
I waited too long…I waited too long

For so many years
How I wish… we found a way
When this world
Came down on us

I wanted you with me
Now I'm alone today
Something special has come and gone
I waited too long…I waited too long
The reason I missed the setting sun
I waited too long…I waited too long
