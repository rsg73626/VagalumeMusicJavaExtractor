ONE IN A MILLION

You're just one in a million
Nobody thought you would go for that
You're just another civilian
Don't even know if you're where you're

But I believe in
You believe in me
We all believe it's true

So you got a job
Yea yea yea
And now you found God
Important friends and a fancy car
Do you believe it's true
One in a million

You got yourself a pavilion
Still wish you lived on the other side
You only wanted a million
But never seem to be satisfied

You want/you need/you wish to be
Just like/you've seen/on your TV
You can't / you don't /you won't believe
You're just one in a million
