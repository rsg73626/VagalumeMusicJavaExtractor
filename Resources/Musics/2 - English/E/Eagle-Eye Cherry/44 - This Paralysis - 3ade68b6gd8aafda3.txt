THIS PARALYSIS

Nothing bitchy will ever leave my lips
And this tingle in my fingertips
Isn't really
A heart attack
Man on the curb
Breathing heavily
And the fear now
That is eating me
Isn't really
From a heart attack 

And this paralysis
Needs no analysis
As I fall apart
At the seams

Feels like centuries
That you have played with me
And in times like this
It escapes me
Why you attack my lead balloon
With your hard attack

And this paralysis
Needs no analysis
As I fall apart
At the seams
From your knockout punch
That floored me with a crunch
To end my unbeaten run
On the scene

Wipe me off the floor
Cut the ground from under me
You wore me like a frock
From a stupid fantasy
We pushed out of bounds
Kicked it from the ground
All 'cause the love we found
Was too tightly wound

I'm in the ocean
I can't feel the ground
And approaching me
Without a sound
Is a thing with attitude
Like a shark attack

And this paralysis
Needs no analysis
As I fall apart
At the seams
From your knockout punch
That floored me with a crunch
To end my unbeaten run
On the scene
