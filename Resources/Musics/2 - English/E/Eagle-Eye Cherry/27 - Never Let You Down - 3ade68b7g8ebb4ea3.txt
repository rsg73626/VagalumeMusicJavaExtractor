NEVER LET YOU DOWN

If you don’t want to smile again
You will cry until the end
Cause I know where you’re bound
With the sorrow that brings you down
So now I beg of you
Tell me what I can do
To make you smile again
Cause I let you down my friend

Now you’re on your own
In a life with your best friend gone
And it ain’t easy to be
In a world of misery
So now I beg…
Tell me what I can do
To make you smile again
Cause I let you down my friend

Your sorrow like rain comes down
In the tears that you shed
Now our love is gone
And your roses are dead
Your sorrow like rain comes down
Your sorrow like rain comes down

Cause I know I let you go
And I’ll always regret it
Cause I let you down my friend
But I’ll never let you down again

Your sorrow like rain comes down
In the tears that you shed
Now our love is gone
And your roses are dead
Your sorrow like rain comes down
Your sorrow like rain comes down

Cause I know I let you go
I’ll always regret it
Cause I let you down my friend
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
I’ll never let you down again
