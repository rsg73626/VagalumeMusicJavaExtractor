RAINBOW WINGS

I met the devil in disguise
With his rainbow wings and a pack of lies

I had my suspicions but they were ignored
Far away the angel cries
How far away the angel sings
Don't sell your sell your soul for a pack of lies
Don't sell your soul

I watched him preach from the book of greed
With promises of glory and how we'll succeed

I had my suspicions but they were ignored
Far away the angel cries
How far away the angel sings
Don't sell your soul for a pack of lies
Don't sell your soul

Far away the angel cries
How far away the angel sings
Don't sell your soul for a pack of lies
Don't sell your soul
