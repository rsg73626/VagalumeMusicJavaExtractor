WALK AWAY

Have you ever met a girl
She becomes your whole world
And your life revolves around her
She don't even know what she can do

Have you ever gone that way
Did she lead you all astray
Try so hard to be cool
Try so hard to be Ok

And you see her clearer now
You see here clearer than she'll ever know

Walk away, walk away
Don't give in
Cause you know
She will get you…in the end

Walk away, walk away
You just can't win
She will get you…in the end

Now do you remember who
You tried to hold on to
And your world crashed down around you
She moved on and you did too

Have you ever felt the pain
One that just won't go away
Try so hard to believe
Try so hard to be ok

And you see her clearer now
You see here clearer than she will ever know

Walk away, walk away

Before you know it she'll be in your blood
And you can't stop
One look and it's over
You swear to god this time is different
But you know it's not
So don't even go there
