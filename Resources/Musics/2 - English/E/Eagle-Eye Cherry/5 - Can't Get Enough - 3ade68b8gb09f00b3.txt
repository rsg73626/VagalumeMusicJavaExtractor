CAN'T GET ENOUGH

You don't see me
Wouldn't want to be me
A "do not disturb" sign is hanging on your door

But I can't get enough of your love
No, I can't get enough of your love

I won't let go
I'll be back tomorrow
And you like to play slow
And leave me wanting more

Cause I can't get enough of your love
No, I can't get enough of your love

I'm willing to do what it takes
But I don't ever want to look back
I'm running away from the dark
And I am never, ever, coming back

Cause I can't get enough of your love
No, I can't get enough of your love
I just can't get enough
Can't get enough,
No, I can't get enough of your love

My friend warned me
You'd blatantly ignore me
But I can play it cool
I like to go against the grain

Cause I know what I want, what I want
Even though I get the feeling you're aâ€¦.

I'm willing to do what it takes
But I don't ever want to look back
I'm running away from the dark
And I am never, ever, coming back

Cause I can't get enough of your love
No, I can't get enough of your love
I just can't get enough
