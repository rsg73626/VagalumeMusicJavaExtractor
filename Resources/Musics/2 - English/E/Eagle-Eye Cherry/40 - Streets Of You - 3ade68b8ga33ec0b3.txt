STREETS OF YOU

I've been losing it again
Barely knowing where I am
And I've been pacing here like every night before
'Cause of you I don't know what to do

Every minute is a week
Broken heart can't get no sleep
I can't hang around this misery no more
'Cause of you I don't know what to do
Yeah it's true I still walk streets of you

When I walk the streets of you
The city sleeps but still reminds me
Moving on away from you
I guess it's time, time to break free
I don't look back
No looking back

Think I'm losing it again
I see you sitting there and then
Then you look at me but there's no looking back
'Cause of you I don't know what to do
Yeah it's true I still walk the streets of you

When I walk the streets of you
The city sleeps but still reminds me
Moving on away from you
I guess it's time, time to break free
I don't look back
No looking back

When I walk the streets of you
The city sleeps, it sleeps with you
So I leave this town behind
Don't look back, my love's not blind

Mmh, no looking back

When I walk the streets of you
The city sleeps but still reminds me
Moving on away from you
I guess it's time, time to break free
I don't look back
No looking back
