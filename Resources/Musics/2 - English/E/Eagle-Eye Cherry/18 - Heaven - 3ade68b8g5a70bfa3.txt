HEAVEN

Heaven wouldn't wait for you
However much you wanted it to
Heaven wouldn't wait for you
Heaven....
When happy clouds come down on me
And the sun doesn't find its way
I just close my eyes and I see
I see you, in heaven

Sorrow I will never be
Knowing you hold heaven's key.
One day I will get to see
You opened heavens gate for me.
Sorrow I will never be
Knowing you hold heaven's key.
One day I will get to see
You opened heavens gate for me.
Like heaven you must wait for me
Heaven ooooh heaven oooh

I live my life from day to day
I would livin it all
And when it's time you guide my way
I'll be waiting for your call
I'll be waiting for your call
And I do miss yesterday
Sharing time with you
I remember what you say
And it all rings so true
Yes I know that, you will be there
Yes I know that, you will be there

Sorrow I will never be
Knowing you hold heaven's key.
One day I will get to see
You opened heavens gate for me.
Sorrow I will never be
Knowing you hold heaven's key.
One day I will get to see
You opened heavens gate for me.
Like heaven you must wait for me

Sorrow I will never be
Knowing you hold heaven's key.
One day I will get to see
You opened heavens gate for me.
Sorrow I will never be
Knowing you hold heaven's key.
One day I will get to see
You opened heavens gate for me.
