MISS FORTUNE

She is my miss fortune
and all the trouble we had
Whenever she is around me
I do something bad

Trouble is her lover
and trouble is her friend
Whenever I am around her
I commit a sin

Trouble is her love
Trouble-love
Trouble is her love

When I'm with my miss fortune
once again I'm the fool
I'm going to lost my composier
going to lost my cool

Should I let her decieve me
should I let her in
Once again she will tease me
once again I'll sin

Trouble is her love
Trouble-love
Dabba-laaha

Trouble is her lover
trouble is her friend
Trouble is her lover
trouble is her sin

Now, Mum and Dad, they always told me:
"Don't play with that girl"
Little bit they know that she can
show me the world
All those things, I was not to do
The one thing I know is that
my love is true

Trouble is her lover
trouble is her friend, oh-yeah
Trouble is her lover
trouble is her sin
Trouble is our love
Yeeah
