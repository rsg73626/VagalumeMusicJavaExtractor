DEATH DEFIED BY WILL

He only thought he was going for the thrill of a ride
Wasn't in the plan to be gone for long
But he keeps looking back over his shoulder
He knows that something might go wrong
The ride it ain't smooth that is for sure
Strange mood what is the cure
He's got that feeling of impending doom
Like being trapped in a casket inside a tomb

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
The joke is on you
You ought to know better
You ought to know better

He is determined to outsmart this snake
With conviction he will stand his ground
Feeling invincible like death itself
His immortality won't be found
What should he say at his own wake
That he refuses to fulfil his fate
He doesn't know that this is his last drive
On the road we call alive

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Now the joke is on you

Now the time has come
You can't play around
And you ought to know
You ought to know better
You ought to know better

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Now the joke is on you
