FREE

When you bound my arms you freed me for flight
When you blindfolded me you freed my sight
When you knocked me down you freed me with a shove
When you hated me you freed me to love

When you stole my book you freed me to learn
When you slapped my cheek you freed me to turn
When you clipped my wings you freed me from the glove
When you hated me you freed me to love

When you cuffed me you cut my burdens off
When you jailed me you sent my dreams aloft
You tried to break me like every sinner does
When you hated me you freed me to love
