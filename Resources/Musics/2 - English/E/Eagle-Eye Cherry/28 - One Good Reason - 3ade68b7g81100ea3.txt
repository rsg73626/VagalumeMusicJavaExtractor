ONE GOOD REASON

Give me one good reason
That I should care
Give me one good reason
And I'll be there
Like a thief you've stolen
Like rain on a grave
Like a priest who's spoken
But failed to save

Now the air is empty
And the ground the same
Love has gone to be buried
Beside my name

Give me one good reason
That I should care
Give me one good reason
And I'll be there

Why couldn't you have told me
about your liar's kiss
I can't believe you'd leave me
At a time like this

And the wind is howling
And it's a dying dream
And my faith is silent
While my doubts scream

Give me one good reason
That I should care
Give me one good reason
And I'll be there

Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason
That I should care

Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason
That I should care

Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason
