SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE

He's going back to Georgia
Because he knows time and time has come
don't even know if shell be waiting
Because he's been gone for way too long

How long will you stay
Boy you don't got nine lives to waste
How long will you stay
Saving time losing grace

She believed every word he told her
About the troubles and how they start
She didn't listen to the laughter
She only listened to her heart

How long will you stay
Boy you don't got nine lives to waste
How long will you stay
Saving time losing grace

She didn't believe
She didn't believe
She didn't believe
She didn't believe

He made a promise to no one
That he could right a wrong
He wanted to do something just
But he was just gone

How long will you stay
Boy you don't got nine lives to waste
How long will you stay
Saving time losing grace

She didn't believe
She didn't believe
She didn't believe believe believe

She didn't believe what they told her about her lover
Nothing left bet her tears and theirs were laughter
