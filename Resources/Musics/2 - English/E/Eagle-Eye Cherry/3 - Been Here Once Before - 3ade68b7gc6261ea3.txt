BEEN HERE ONCE BEFORE

Got your back up against the wall
Now you know that after all
When you make mistakes like that
There's no more turning back
Now we've gone and we've lost our heads
You're better off just playing dead
Why you wearing that black hat
There's no point in turning back

I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before
I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before

Well all you know is you need to win
Should you go when your call comes in
Once you see all the blood that flows
I don't think you'll be winning more
Now I thought that was all in the past
And that beast would come back last
Once again we are at war
Yes I know we've been here before

I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before...that's for sure
I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before

And I don't think you'll be winning more
We've been here once before
We've been here that's for sure
I don't think you'll be winning more
We've been here once before
We've been here that's for sure

I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before...that's for sure
I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before

And I don't think you'll be winning more
We've been here once before
We've been here that's for sure
I don't think you'll be winning more
We've been here once before
We've been here that's for sure

I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before
I know, I know, I know
That we've been here once before

Been here once before...
