THE FOOD SONG

The Food Song 

Recipes are just combinations 
And what are these just mere salutations 
When they plead for our salvation 
Are these just the lies that feed our nations 

As enemies we never learn 
A shaking hand is never firm 
But as the path clears we turn away from it all 

All these jealousies we have earned 
Oh so shamelessly they still return 
All the outlandish lessons we have burned 
Yes and we're imprisoned by the whole thing 

Who gets something really good to eat 
Why do we want the world to fall at our feet 
Like a child throws its food to the floor 
Like an apple that is rotten to the core 

As all the memories they kick in 
The gravy, it is thickening 
The combination is sickening 
But we still press on 

And as all the memories they kick 
While the gravy it is thickening 
And the combination is sickening 
But we still press on 

How to know what's in your head 
How to know if your just playing dead 
But it's all gonna be that way when you say you're alone and imprisoned by your yesterdays 

Oh you know what you really want 
But yet you've turned yourself into what you don't really wanna be 
Jere we are and we know don't have to be that way 
yes u know it
