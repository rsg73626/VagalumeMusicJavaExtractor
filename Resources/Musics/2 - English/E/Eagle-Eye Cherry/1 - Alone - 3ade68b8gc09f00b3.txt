ALONE

Faded dreams had no chance to be
Last good buy dust to dust
You're on your knees praying silently
Shedding tears for all of us

Loss of words
All along the way
Loss of words
nothing left to say

You don't have to worry
You will never be alone for another day

Blinded friends only strangers see
No more them no more us
Silent prayer filled with misery
A thousand nails turn to rust

Loss of words
All along the way
Loss of words
nothing left to say
