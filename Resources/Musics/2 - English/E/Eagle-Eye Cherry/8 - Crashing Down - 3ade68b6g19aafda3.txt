CRASHING DOWN

I’ve never see the sky like that
I can’t believe that it could do that
I closed my eyes before the sun could set
I slept and waited for my, waited for my…

I waited for my dreams to land
I waited for my dreams to touch down
I waited patiently to hear the sound
I waited for the song to get me out, to get me out of…

And I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Yes I was up above
Watching myself crashing down

I’ve never seen so many lights
I’ve never heard so many voices
No one will tell me how I ended here
No one will tell me where, oh tell me where, oh tell me where I am
Where I am

And I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Yes I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Watching myself crashing down

Yes I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
There I was up above
Watching myself crashing down
Watching myself crashing down
Watching myself crashing down
