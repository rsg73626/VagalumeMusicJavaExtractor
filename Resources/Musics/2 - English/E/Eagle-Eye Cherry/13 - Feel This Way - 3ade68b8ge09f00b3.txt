FEEL THIS WAY

I don't know why you never noticed
So many people that we don't miss

No time, no time to speak
Don't mind every time we meet… this way
How long can we feel like this
So long that we never miss… this day

Like we 're never gonna feel this way again
It's like it wasn't even real it's just pretend
Like we 're never gonna feel this way
Never gonna feel this way again

Don't ask me why we can't control this
How much you try can't keep your promise
No time … never time to speak
Don't mind every time we meet… this way
How long can we feel like this
So long that we never miss… this day

Like we 're never gonna feel this way again
It's like it wasn't even real it's just pretend
Like we 're never gonna feel this way
Never gonna feel this way again
