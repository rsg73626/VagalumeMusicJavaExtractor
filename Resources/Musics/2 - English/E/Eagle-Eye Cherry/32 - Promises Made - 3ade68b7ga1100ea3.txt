PROMISES MADE

Promises made they were lost
Somewhere beside you
Waiting around can leave some
Feeling like I do
Promises made and we stayed
Dreaming of leaving

We will find good days for us
The sun will shine brightly
Live our life if only for just
A moment

The goodbyes are gone but the echoes remain
To remind you
Oh we could belong to the lucky ones
If we just tried to
Promises made where we laid
Our days of believing

We will find good days for us
The sun will shine brightly
Live our life if only for just
A moment

It's okay to cry for a moment
When promises shatter
But don't waste your tears for too long
Because soon it won't matter
Promises made they were lost
But don't bother grieving

We will find good days for us
The sun will shine brightly
Live our life if only for just
