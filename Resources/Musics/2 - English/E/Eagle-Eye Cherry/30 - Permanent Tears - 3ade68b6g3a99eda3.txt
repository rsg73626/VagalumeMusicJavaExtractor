PERMANENT TEARS

On the day of her arrival
No one is there to meet her
Something of a sad one
A girl with permanent tears

Born without a family
Born without a name
All she ever wanted
Was to wipe her tears away
Wipe her tears away.......... away
Away.........away

If someone came to love her
And if someone came to be
The one that will protect her
Be a family
Now we will see a smile again
And tears like dreams can be
Something we will never see
Lost in her memory 
wipe her tears away....away..away
wipe her tears away..tears away...away...away

she's something of a tragedy
stands in the shade of despair 
i want to cast some loght onto her world
a world of permanent tears

Born without a family
Born without a name
Free this weeping willow
From drowning in a flood of tears
Wipe her tears away
Tears away..........away.............away (Repeat)
