DON'T GIVE UP

All our dreams are gone 
With a loss of faith
We're still hanging on 
For another day
It's so hard to see
That it's going to get better
And when will that be
It's hard to say

We must believe
That if we give we will receive
Yes we must believe
That it's going to get better

(2x)
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop 
Giving all we got

Now we're breaking away
From what holds us down
And this could be the day
That brings out the light
Now we're marching on
With the will of never giving up
This time we'll have won
With out a fight

We must believe
That if we give we will receive
Yes we must believe
That it's going to get better

(3x)
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop 
Giving all we got

Forgive and forget don't hold on to the bitterness 
Filled with regrets we don't wanna go there again 
The glass is half full so lets get it on with togetherness
And our number will grow we will prevail in the end

(10x)
Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop 
Giving all we got
