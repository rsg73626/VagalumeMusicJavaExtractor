ARE YOU STILL HAVING FUN?

You live on your own, you do as you please 
Having so much fun gone and lost your reason 
After all is said and done 
Well are you still having fun 
And how is he to know when you've gone astray 
And happiness would go like a vast emotion 
You have always got a way 
Are you happy today 

Well you know when you've been defeated 
You don't care and you thank no one 
Feelin' low you would always need it 
Now - you're havin' fun
Oh - Don't know what it is you've done 
Oh - your - don't - yeah. 

This was your mistake in your master plan 
With all the drugs you take you can hardly stand it 
After all is said and done 
Well are you still havin' fun? 

Well you know when you've been defeated 
You don't care and you thank no one 
Feelin' low you would always need it 
Now - you're havin' fun 
Well are you still havin' fun 
Oh - you don't know what it is you've done 
Oh - Just to show that you're havin fun 
Ah - you don't know what it is you've done 
Ah - are you sure yeah. 

I can set you straight if you let me stay 
I hope I'm not too late now you won't regret it 
I can show you the way 
And get you happy today 

Well you know when you've been defeated 
You don't care and you thank no one 
Feelin' low you will always need it 
Well you know that you're bein' cheated 
Yeh you know the you are deafeated 
Feelin' low you would always need it 
But now you're havin' fun 
Like you're still havin' fun 
Are you still havin' fun? 
Are you still havin fun?
