HOW COME

How Come 

I can still see the change 
In the falling rain 
How come we can’t do the same 
How come 

I see the angry scar 
But the wound is tame 
How come we can’t do the same 
How come 

I hear the radio playing 
A song about change 
How come we don't feel the same 
How come 

I hear the church bells laugh 
It’s a wedding day 
How come we don’t feel that way 
How come 

When the clouds step aside 
(I don’t want to be you) 
The sun lets them live 
(you don’t want to be me) 
How come we can’t forgive 
(neither one should be) 
How come 

When the clouds step aside 
(I don’t want to be here) 
The sun lets them live 
(you don’t want to be here) 
How come we can’t forgive 
(there is nobody here) 
How come 
(there is nobody here) 
How come
