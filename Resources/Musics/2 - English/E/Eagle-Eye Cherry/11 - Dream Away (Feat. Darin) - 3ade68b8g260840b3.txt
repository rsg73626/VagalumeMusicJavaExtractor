DREAM AWAY (FEAT. DARIN)

Let's dream away from here, tonight
Just let it go and close your eyes
Leave all your troubles here with me
You always know where I will be

Let's dream away and go back home
Don't wanna do this all alone
Can't find a reason not to go
Won't need to say "I told you so"

We all need somebody
Together makes us stronger
Don't have to do this alone

So let me take you away
Say goodbye to your broken heart
Just let me take you away
When you're dreaming, don't ever stop
Don't ever stop

Let's dream away from here, tonight
I'll always be right by your side
Promise we can always get through
As long as one makes me and you

We all need somebody
Together makes us stronger
Don't have to do this alone

So let me take you away
Say goodbye to your broken heart
Just let me take you away
When you're dreaming, don't ever stop

So let me take you away
Say goodbye to your broken heart
Just let me take you away
When you're dreaming, don't ever stop
Don't ever stop

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye to your broken heart

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye to your broken heart

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye

So let me take you away
Say goodbye to your broken heart
Just let me take you away
When you're dreaming, don't ever stop
Don't you ever stop

So let me take you away
Say goodbye to your broken heart
Just let me take you away
When you're dreaming, don't ever stop
No, don't ever stop

Let's dream away from here, tonight
Just let it go and close your eyes
