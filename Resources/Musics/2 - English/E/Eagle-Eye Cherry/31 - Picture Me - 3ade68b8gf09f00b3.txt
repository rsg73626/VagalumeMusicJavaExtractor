PICTURE ME

Picture me walking on Bleeker & 7th
Picture me thinking of less than ever
Picture me stuck in a cab going crosstown
Reaching for the dial on the stereo when you song comes on

Picture me falling apart
Picture me falling apart again
Picture me falling apart ‐ just as I was on my feet again
Picture me falling apart ‐ I will get myself back on the mend
Picture me falling apart

Picture me keeping my mind on what matters
Picture me watching the clouds as they scatter ‐ like I don't care
Picture me riding a train going out of tour
Reaching for a magazine, the cover's got your face on it

Picture me falling apart
Picture me falling apart again
Picture me falling apart ‐ just as I was on my feet again
Picture me falling apart ‐ I will get myself back on the mend
Picture me falling apart

I keep it together like you were never mind

Picture me falling apart
Picture me falling apart ‐ just as I was on my feet again
Picture me falling apart ‐ I will get myself back on the mend
Picture me falling apart
