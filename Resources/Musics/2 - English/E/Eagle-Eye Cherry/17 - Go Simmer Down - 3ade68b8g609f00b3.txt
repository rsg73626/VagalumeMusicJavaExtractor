GO SIMMER DOWN

I've been dizzy in a blizzard for days
And as I unzip her I just wish I didn't miss you this much
I'd rather take my chances riding this avalanche
If it means that I don't feel my bones are being crushed

That's when it seems
Like I'm stuck on the good years
How did I get here?
We're on repeat and we're going no where…yea

Why you fire up yourself go simmer down
Why you fire up yourself go simmer down
When you feel the freeze
Go simmer down

I've been spitting ammunition and missing the right conviction
And my bruise is feeling sore to the touch
I'd rather be diggin' than be bitching about how some shit
I'm in just makes it difficult to get the rush

That's when it seems
Like I'm stuck on the good years
How did I get here?
We're on repeat and we're going no where…yea

Why you fire up your self go simmer down
When you feel the freeze
Go simmer down

Cool and all right you've been up all night
And your feet don't touch the ground
