WISHING IT WAS

Beauty and grace is what touches me most
Good times can put me in fear
I always feel safe when things are bad
So I can not let you come near
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you have come and bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry
But happiness does
It's so strange to watch my life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyday surprises me
Wishing it was

This feeling won't last
Ã«Cause I can not survive
I tell you I've been here before
When it's movin' this fast
It's a matter of time
One of us walks out that door
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you come and you bring out the tears in me

But happiness does
It's so strange to watch my life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyday surprises me
Wishing it was

Give this some thought
And I'm sure you will know
This is the way it must be
Emotions will rise
Emotions will flow
You bring out the tears in me
You bring out the tears in me
