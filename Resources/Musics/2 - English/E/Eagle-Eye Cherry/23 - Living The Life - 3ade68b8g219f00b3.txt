LIVING THE LIFE

Josie's never been the type of girl to stop and think it through
Just like you
And now she's hunting dreams that leave you feeling so far removed
With no clue

She goes out all night
Out all night
She's got to get back up, shake it off, change it for a better mood
Yeah you do

You've been living the life
You've been hitting I high
It ain't hard to survive
You've been living the life

Everybody's running down to see the shadow fight for him
Think he'll win?
It feels like Rock & Roll is beatin' up on all the play with him
To fit in

He goes out all night
Out all night
You've got get back up, shake it off, and don't forget about your friends
Don't give in
You've been living the life
You've been hitting I high
It ain't hard to survive
You've been living the life

Now Josie's gone and made a vow live in disarray
On display
All the moves she makes is gonna be about the game she plays
Every day
She goes out all night
Out all night
She's got to get back up, shake it off, change it for a better way
Don't delay
