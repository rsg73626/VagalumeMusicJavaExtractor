YOUR HERO

You wish your senses
Have been valued
In that situation
We got caught up
In their slack
And their... humiliationâ€¦ oh no

Oh boy by all the means
You don't have what it takes to fly
Hell and all break loose
And you'll become the bitter one

That was stolen
By their hands in your fall
Left us here with truly
Nothing at all

Back In the corner
You were hiding
In the darkest hall

Always find you
Slowly grind you
Did we all go numb

Get's so lonely
No ones there when you call
Left us here with truly
Nothing at all

I'll be your hero
I'll be your friend
I'll be there
I'll listen
I'll stay to the end
I'll be your hero
I'll be your guide
I'll love you forever
Till the end of all time
