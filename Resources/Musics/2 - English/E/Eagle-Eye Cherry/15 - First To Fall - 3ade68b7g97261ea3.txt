FIRST TO FALL

What you doing in the alley
What you doing my friend
What you doing in the alley
Are you lost again

Ain't no good going down that road honey
Ain't no good at all
Getting down on your knees just for the money
And you're the first to fall

No shame you feel no shame
Just come back home again
No blame I lay no blame
Just come back home again

Going on a road trip easy rider
One thing you've got to know
You walking on a minefield
Better watch your number
Before you know it you might blow

I can see the sand in the hourglass
And I can hear the last call
You better take you're chance before it's in the past
And you're the first to fall

No shame you feel no shame
Just come back home again
No blame I lay no blame
Just come back home again

No shame you feel no shame
Just come back home again
No blame I lay no blame
Just come back home again
Just come back home again
Just come back home again
Just come back home again
Just come back home again
