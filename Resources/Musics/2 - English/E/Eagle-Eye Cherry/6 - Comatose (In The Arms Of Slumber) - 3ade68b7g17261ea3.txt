COMATOSE (IN THE ARMS OF SLUMBER)

The doors are closed and the walls are white
Someone calls but I don't want to talk tonight
Stay away you all want to.......stay away
I'm going to be all right......all right

CHORUS:
Within the arms of slumber
Going to leave it all behind
Comatose gone under
Like all the other times

With pride and disdain I'm going to ignore this pain
When someone falls you're supposed to get up again
I try to oblige but I can't tonight
I'm going to be all right......all right

CHORUS

Comfort of my dreams
I resign myself to you
Dream as I might
I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
So stay away....stay away
While I'm in the arms of slumber
And I'm leaving it all behind

The magic of sweet Morpheus you're doing it once again
You saved me from my sadness you saved me from my pain
Protect me from depression protect me one more night
And I'll be all right......all right

CHORUS

Comfort of my dreams
I resign myself to you
Dream as I might
I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
So stay away....stay away
