YOU KILL ME (EVERYDAY)

You're a circle with four corners
You're a clock with out the time
A book without the words
Revolution isn't mine

You're a war without a cause
A junkie and a drug
You're a win but still you're lost
Now you punch me with a hug

You…
Kill me every day
You…
With you there is no better mistake

You're a fight with out the fist
You're a world that doesn't turn
A light that never goes out
You're a fire that won't burn

You're a heart without the beat
You're a tragedy that's fun
A spoon with cutting edges
Your stopping on the run

You…
Kill me every day
You…
With you there is no better mistake

I never never ever put a stone into your ship
I never ever never give up

You're Marilyn with no red lips
Lips that always kiss kiss
I miss the way you look
Look like I'm bait on a hook
The queen and the crook
Peter Pan and Captain Hook
I'm pleading for a happy end and that love never ends ends ends...

You…
Kill me every day
You…
With you there is no better mistake
I never never ever put a stone into your ship
I never ever never give up
