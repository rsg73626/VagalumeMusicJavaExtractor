FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN

Well I'm so tired
Of falling in love
Finding it easier to fall out
You can't deny it
I feel it inside Cupid's fire
I can't hide

But I'm falling in love again
Ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again
Girl this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game

It's been so long now
Since I gave up my heart
I've kept it locked down
I don't wanna get it harmed
So let me tell you now
I just want to be sure
That you won't hurt me
Can you promise me that

Because I'm falling in love again
Ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again
Girl this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game

You got to tell me
If you're going to break my heart
Cause' I don't wanna take the chance
And if it ain't true
All it's gonna be is nothing
But a poor romance
So, give me that promise or hold on now
And I'll never let you go
I gotta have something go on,
Or I'm letting you know now

Falling in love again
ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again, girl
And this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game, yeah

Falling in love again (repeat)
