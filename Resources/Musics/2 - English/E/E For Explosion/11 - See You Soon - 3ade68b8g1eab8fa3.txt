SEE YOU SOON

Sleep all summer long
for when the autumn comes
I'll be tangled in your arms
with the miles between us long gone.

Dream all summer long
for when the autumn comes
you'll have wandered into my arms
full of memories of a season long gone.

Try and remember the fireflies and the twilights
and how the dusk lasted so long that
you thought the day had won
and that idea that made no sense
so lonely and out of place at home in your own bed
you're not alone...

Sing all summer long
for when the summer's gone
and you're drifting off in my arms
I will sing you to sleep with that very same song
so you'll know you're not alone
