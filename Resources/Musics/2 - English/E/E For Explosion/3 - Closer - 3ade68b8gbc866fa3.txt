CLOSER

I, I heard
"I will be watching you"
I, I heard
"I will be watching you"

When the life floods in
Will you hold me close
In the time in between
Sleep and dreams
Won't suit us

No you won't sleep alone
(I'll sleep a little closer to you)
No you won't sleep alone
(I'll sleep a little closer to you)

I, I heard
"I will be watching you"
I, I heard
"I will be watching you"

When the crowds flood in
Will you hold me close
And the thoughts in between
Sleep and dreams
Belong to us

No you won't sleep alone
(I'll sleep a little closer to you)
No you won't sleep alone
(I'll sleep a little closer to you)

You won't sleep alone
(I'll sleep a little closer to you)
No you won't sleep alone
(I'll sleep a little closer to you)

Alone...
