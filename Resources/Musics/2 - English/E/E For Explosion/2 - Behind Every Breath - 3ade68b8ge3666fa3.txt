BEHIND EVERY BREATH

Behind every breath hides a word
Waiting for its chance to be heard
Hoping to make any kind of sense out of this

And I heard your wish for sleep
And the trust you place in science over dreams
Just try to find your way to me
We won't be missed

You will always hold my faith
And I will never be too far away

And I beg you close your eyes
I'm only a voice, just a thought, just a reason.
I could be your best excuse to live a lie
And I'll do all I can to make your heart beat with mine

Between all the sirens and the sounds
And all the words we'll never speak aloud
I'm praying when I finally come down
You're who I'll see

And I know you're kind of used to saving lives
But tell me what you think you can do with mine
Cause it's hurting more and more
Every time you're close to me

You will always hold my faith
And I will never be too far away
I beg you close your eyes
I'm only a voice, just a thought, just a reason
I could be your best excuse to live a lie
And I'll do all I can to make your heart beat with mine
