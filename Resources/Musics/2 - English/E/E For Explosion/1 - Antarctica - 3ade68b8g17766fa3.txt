ANTARCTICA

Aren't we leaving today?
Abandoning the world
No more cities or kill technology
No more boys and no more girls

I pray for the snow
You and I drown in the blue and cold
And fall so low
Teach me how to whisper...
Teach me how to whisper...

Are we leaving today?
We're learning to die
Learning soft
Through beautiful goodbyes

I pray for the snow
We'll fall so low
Teach me how to whisper...

Teach me how to whisper...
Teach me how to whisper...
