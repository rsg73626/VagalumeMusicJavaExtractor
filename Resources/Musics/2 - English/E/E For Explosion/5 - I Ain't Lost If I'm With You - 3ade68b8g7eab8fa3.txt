I AIN'T LOST IF I'M WITH YOU

Find me only in dreams
Thumbing my stitches and seams
With patchwork skin and quilted smile
I breathe recycled air and sleep on borrowed time.

My foot prints are heaven bound
Through snow and ice and shattered sound
Hide me in that smile you wear
In those dreaming eyes...
In the tangles of your hair
I'll still be yours when all this is through
'Cause I ain't lost if I'm with you
