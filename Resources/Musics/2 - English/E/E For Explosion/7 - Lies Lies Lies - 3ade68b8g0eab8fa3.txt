LIES LIES LIES

I hear about all I'm good for is spouting off lines of love
'cause I've been saving those fears
for another set of ears
as lonely and naive as mine.

If it's addiction you want... well you've got it
They don't come no more addicted than me
A couples pills to help me think
then pour some whiskey in my drink
and I'll pray you're the one that keeps me from my dreams.

'Cause my dear, you're too good to be
I can't find better reasons for losing some sleep
Just save me a place between your sheets
and I'll let you make a mess out of me.

And I'm down for loving those lies
If you can tell them the way I tell mine
Just leave some poison from your kiss
to do it's work upon my lips
and this boy will grace a slow death with a smile

If it's addiction you want... well you got it
they don't come no more addicted than me
A couples pills to get me through
'cause it's all that I can do
While I pray you're the one that keeps me from my dreams.

'Cause my dear, you're too good to be
I can't find better reasons for losing some sleep
Just save me a place between your sheets
and I'll let you make a mess out of me
