SAVING LIVES

Does he know all the things I say to you?
Or am I just wasting my breath on some unspoken truth?
Don't expect me to heal your wounds,
'Cause I don't wanna hear my name,
When you're alone, alone, alone again.
I just wanna feel the same, feel the same, feel the same.

'Cause if you ever go...
I don't think I'll have the strength to follow.
While I've been watching the world we think we know, fall apart.
I've been trying my best to stop asking myself what all of this is for.
'Cause I ain't in the business of saving lives anymore.

I don't think I'm ready to see,
To see the distance between actual, and eventually.
'Cause I've never really been who I was supposed to be,
'Cause all I really wanted to hear is that you feel the same,
I wanna learn to breathe again every time I hear your name.

'Cause if you ever go...
I don't think I'll have the strength to follow.
While I've been watching the world we think we know, fall apart.
I've been trying my best to stop asking myself what all of this is for.
'Cause I ain't in the business of saving lives anymore.

Would this have ever made any sense,
Tell me is it still a mistake to speak of you in the present tense?
And though your kiss still feels more like love, than it does regret.
I don't wanna hear my name,
When you're alone, alone, alone again.
I just wanna feel the same, feel the same, feel the same.

'Cause if you ever go...
I don't think I'll have the strength to follow,
While I've been watching the world we think we know, fall apart.
I've been trying my best to stop asking myself what all of this is for.
'Cause I ain't in the business of saving lives anymore
