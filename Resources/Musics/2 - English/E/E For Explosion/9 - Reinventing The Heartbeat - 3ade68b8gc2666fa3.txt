REINVENTING THE HEARTBEAT

I wanna reinvent the heartbeat
Sleep with suicide
So lost in medication
I miss my butterflies

I wanna lose you in the sunbeams
Destroy our way through the day
Love like the world was ending

Cause I'm still dying anyway
(I'm still dying anyway)
I wanna hide in your shadow
We can wander for always
I can love you more than those other boys
Though I'm still dying anyway
(I'm still dying anyway)
Cause I'm still dying anyway
(I'm still dying anyway)

I wanna reinvent the heartbeat
Sleep with suicide
I'm so lost in medication
I miss my butterflies
(I wanna reinvent the heartbeat)
(I wanna reinvent the heartbeat)

Cause I'm still dying anyway
(I'm still dying anyway) (x4)
