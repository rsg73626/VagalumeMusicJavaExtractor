ECHOES

I'll be your heartbeat, I'll be under your skin,
You'll be my saint, and I'll gladly be your sin,
Everything I've promised, will hold true,
If you have to hurt, I will hurt with you.

When we wake up, when we're no longer known,
When we make our peace with time,
For you, I'll stay alive.

We both know, why ___ (?) forever,
Just give me the reasons, and I will pen the letters.
Questioned or accused is this any way to live your life?
To only live and love, beneath fluorescent lights.

When we wake up, when we're no longer young,
When we wage our war on time,
For you, I'll stay alive,
For you, I'll stay alive.

When we wake up,
When we push our last breath from our lungs,
When we question why we're alive,
For you, I will try,

When we wake up, when we're no longer known,
When we make our peace with time,
For you, I'll stay alive,
For you, I'll stay alive,
For you, I'll stay alive,
For you, I'll stay alive.
