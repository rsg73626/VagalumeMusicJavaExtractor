PAPER FLOWERS NEVER DIE

Where I sit, I dream for days
Tracing your name in the carpet
I miss the things they took away
I beg you, help me not forget

Why can't you be here now?
Can't you see I breathe for you?
Love, my love, don't lose me
My paper flower, through and through

With you, I'd hide forever at last
If you wanted me to love you
All you had to do was ask

The distorted kiss of the frequencies
Such a beautiful noise
So out of step, so lost, so sweet
It's just the smile of your voice

Why can't you be here now?
Can't you see I breathe for you?
Love, my love, don't lose me
My paper flower, through and through

Stop, stop, stop before you claim me crazy
Nothing real should make sense anyways
With you, I'd hide forever at last
If you wanted me to love you
All you had to do was ask

Can't you see I breathe for you?
