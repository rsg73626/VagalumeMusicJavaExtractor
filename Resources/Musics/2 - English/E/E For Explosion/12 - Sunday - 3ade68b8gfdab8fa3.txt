SUNDAY

We wander in our sleep
Hiding from our dreams
Hiding from our ghosts.

I know where you go
As bright as stars and quiet as snow

I'd give anything for you...
Anything for you to know me now

I would kill to be alive
To see through different eyes
Please slow me down

You've taken my last breath from me
My girl who killed the world
Please don't make me make believe that you should be alone.

Please don't go
