YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE

I'm standing here before you
And I know I'm such a wreck
I should be somebody's mess
I could be your mess

You're drop-dead bittersweet
I'm your imaginary friend
Your devastating daydream
You're my song that never ends
Don't ever
End

If I could make a promise
To give you your last first kiss
Would you swear to keep my smile
Hanging from your lips

'Cause I'm still falling for memory
Still falling into the eyes
Of the picture that I keep of you
It's keeping me alive

I've been hiding in the real world
Losing who I am
And I'm still having trouble
Dreaming dreams you'll never understand

I'm standing here before you
And I know I'm such a wreck
I should be somebody's mess
I could be your mess

'Cause when you're close to me
I'm in heaven [8x]
