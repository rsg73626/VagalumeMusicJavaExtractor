EVILUTION

I have the key to the abyss
I hold the great chain
Seize the dragon
That ancient serpent
Bind him for a thousand years

Devil - Satan
Throw him - Lock him

EVILUTION
Souls of those who had been behealed

For their testimony
They had not workshipped the beast
They had not received his mark

Devil - Satan
Throw him - Lock him

EVILUTION
Souls of those who had been behealed
