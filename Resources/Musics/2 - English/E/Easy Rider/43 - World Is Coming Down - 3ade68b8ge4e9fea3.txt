WORLD IS COMING DOWN

We´ll never know the reason
Why some souls are destined for pain
While others have doors opened for them
And dance through the landmines unscathed
Know the devil
All along he´s,
He´s walked through our lives
Around the corner
All he has is
Time to make changes
Voice opinions
We cannot live our lives in vain
How will we see more clearly
The answers to what has been stained
Feel the devil
He´s the cold wind
The cold wind that bites
He´s been there since,
Since the dawn of time
To conquer and divide
The world is coming down, down, down
The world is coming down
The world is coming down, down, down
The world is coming down
It´s coming, the world is coming down
Spinning round and round
The world is coming down, down, down
The world is coming down
The world is coming down, down, down
The world is coming down
If there´s light there´s also the darkness
The battle of heaven and hell
Throughout time in man´s constant conflict
Our actions do speak for ourselves
There´s the devil
Once again he´s,
He´s surfaced again
Made his mark he´s
Left his trail of sin
To show where´s he´s been
The world is coming down, down, down
The world is coming down
The world is coming down, down, down
The world is coming down
