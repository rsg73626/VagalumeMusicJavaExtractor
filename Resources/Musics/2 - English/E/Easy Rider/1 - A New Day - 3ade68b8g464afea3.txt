A NEW DAY

Dark is the day like the night
We yearn for the sun
I cry for our world and what is now left of it
The grave it´s become
We pray for ourselves and for those who did
Decide not to come
Riding the skies there´s a strange
Sort of peacefullness
Non existent below
Anticipating the rain of death
We´ve all decided we just can´t give up yet
On metal wings we´ll escape the reaper
Our only hope to find a sanctuary where

A new day will come
For our daughters for our sons
A new hope above
My family lived through what came to be
The war straight from hell
Impossible would be the storiies
For our children
With no one to tell
I still do question
What lies ahead
Would we´ve been better off dead
On metal wings we´ll escape the reaper
Our only hope to find a sanctuary where

A new day will come
For our daughters for our sons
A new hope above
Our destination unknown
Our only hope to find a sanctuary where

A new day will come
For our daughters for our sons
A new hope above
