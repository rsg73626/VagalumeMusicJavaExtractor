MAN MADE MARTYR

They have gathered here today
For a chance to see the cloth
The cloth worn by the chosen one
To hear the blessed one say:
"gaze upon me what I hold
Is stained now with his blood
The evil nation has taken him
Prepare for holy war
Long ago the prophet wrote
Of how one man would bring fear again
In the name of his god
His people would follow
The made him more than man
The called him martyr
They´d die just for this man
A man made martyr
Confussion in their eyes
Brainwashed all their life
Minds so dangerous
Poisoning their kind
What will it take for man to see
How destructive his nature can be
Until then the´ll chant and prey
For the next one to follow
The made him more than man
The called him martyr
They´d die just for this man
The one called martyr
A martyr
They will meet in secrecy
To plan the next campaign
Of terror and of evil
Instilled inside is their hate
Long ago the prophet wrote
Of how one man would bring fear again
In the name of his god
His people would follow
The made him more than man
The called him martyr
They´d die just for this man
A man made martyr
A man made martyr
A man made martyr
