SIGNS

Great and wondrous signs appeared in heaven
A woman clothed with the sun
An enormous red dragon
Who leads the whole world astray
His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky

She gave birth to a son, a male child
Who will rule all the nations with an iron sceptre
And there was war in heaven
Angels fought against the dragon

Signs have come! Salvation and power
Signs of the kingdom of our mighty God
Signs have come! Salvation and power
The accuser has been hurled down

But woe to the earth and the sea
Because the devil has gone down to you!
He is filled with fury
Because he knows that his time is short
He pursued the woman
Who was given two wings of a great eagle
The dragon was enraged

Signs have come! Salvation and power
Signs of the kingdom of our mighty God
Signs have come! Salvation and power
The accuser has been hurled down

Signs have come! Signs of the kingdom
Salvation and power
