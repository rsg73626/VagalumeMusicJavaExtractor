BLAZING FIRE VICTORY

I saw heaven standing open
And there before me was a white horse
I saw justice
He judges and makes war
Whose rider is called "faithful and true"

He has a name written on him
That no-one but himself knows

Praise our God
All you his servants
You who fear him
Both small and great!

For our lord God almighty reigns
Let us rejoice and be glad
And give him glory

Victory! He´s king of kings
Dipped in blood his VICTORY
Victory! He´s king of kings
Blazing fire his VICTORY

White linen, bright and clean
The armies of heaven where following him
Sharp swords out of his mouth

He judges and makes war
He´s called "faithful and true"
Fine linen, Sharp swords are following him

Victory! He´s king of kings
Dipped in blood his VICTORY
Victory! He´s king of kings
Blazing fire his VICTORY
