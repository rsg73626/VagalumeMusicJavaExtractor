NEVERWORLD

An open mind
Subconscious find
A doorway unlocked that was lost left behind
Falling into space
I leave this place
A portal to fantasy is what awaits
The inner child in you
Will show you the way
Just let go
Search your soul
Once you have entered the realm you will know
Somewhere inbetween
Dimensions seen
Only by those who´ve been given the key

Neverworld
Into infinity
Neverworld
Is what you make it to be
If you follow the light
Spiral staircases wind
To the heavens you´ll climb
Close your eyes
Realize
A doorway exists between body and mind
Another day
If you find the way
Find your way back
Or it´s there you will stay
Neverworld
It transcends all belief
Neverworld
It´s a place made from dreams
The inner child in you
Will show you the way
If you follow the light
Spiral staircases wind
To the heavens you´ll climb
And if you take the wrong turn
Hell awaits you will burn
Take my hand you will learn
