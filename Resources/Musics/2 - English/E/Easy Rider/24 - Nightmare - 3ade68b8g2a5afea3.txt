NIGHTMARE

You´ve never feared the darkness
But now things have changed
I am the stories now come true
You´ll be lucky if you see the day
The TV tells of all the nasty things I do
They say the´re onto me,
They haven´t got a clue
You´ll be lucky if you see the day
For I´ve been only one step away
I´m your nightmare
You´ll call me by name
I´ll make you my own
You will feel my pain
Something about the night time
Touches me inside
Tonight I´ll show you paradise
The adrenalin flows through my veins
You will share in my limelight, my fame
I´m your nightmare
You´ll call me by name
I´ll make you my own
You will feel my pain
Don´t be scared now my love
For soon I will set you free
Let us dance into eternity
I´m your nightmare, I´ll always be near
I´m the chill in your spine, the voices you hear
I´m your nightmare, the master in black
Nightmare, don´t turn your back
Nightmare, see you in your dreams
