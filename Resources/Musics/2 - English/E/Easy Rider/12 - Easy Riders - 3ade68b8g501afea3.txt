EASY RIDERS

Another day I hear the
EASY RIDERS Spirit calling me
Far from beyond
Another chance to save your soul
From all the evil hordes
We will stand

When all around you
Has turned to insanity
When all inside you
Has become insane

We will fight, we will stand
For the EASY RIDERS Spirit
Riding on the wings of destiny
We´re alive, we will rise
It´s the EASY RIDERS Spirit
The strangers march

We´re all friend
We will never have to say goodbye
This is your time
We will play eternally
We´ll go beyond the sound
This is our paradise

Close your eyes
Fly as high as you can dream
Higher than the sky
Raise your hands
We´re the ones who
Will survive forever
The power´s inside our hearts
