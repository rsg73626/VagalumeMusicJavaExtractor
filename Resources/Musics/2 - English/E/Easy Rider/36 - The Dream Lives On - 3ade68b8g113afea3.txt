THE DREAM LIVES ON

Do you know passion?, is it real?
One you wake with and truly feel
Does it enpower your mind?
And do you dream at night?
And if you feel you live it
Then you have found
Your lifeblood
Your true love
You feel it running through your veins
Realice it´s special don´t let go
What some will never know
Now don´t forget it nor regret it
It´s like your secret talisman
Realice it´s your light your sunshine
What some will never find
Life can bring us the hard times
So all the more it feels good to know
The dream lives on
And with life comes its virtue
We carry on but through out thick and thin
The dream lives on
A flash of color a scene that´s stilled
Life is short make it what you will
Is destiny preordained
Or is it just
Something attained
Choices we´ve made
That write the chapters of our lives
Life can bring us the hard times
So all the more it feels good to know
The dream lives on
And with life comes it´s virtue
We carry on but through out thick and thin
The dream lives on
Realice it´s special don´t let go
What some will never know

[Chorus]
