NO ROOM IN HELL

A barren wasteland of what´s to come
Unholy dread has descended on us
The unexplainable is true
Is this our final doom?
A scream in the night,
Look out for they´re coming for you
It´s the dawn of the dead
A mutation of man´s mistake
I remember what grandfather said:
"with no room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth
When there´s no room in hell
The dead will walk again"
A ghastly vision of our world
I can´t believe of what´s transpired
Will we live to see tomorrow?
Or will we burn in hell´s fire?
"they feed on the living" the media said
Mindless relentless they hunger for flesh
It´s the dawn of the dead
A mutation of man´s mistake
I remember what grandfather said:
"with no room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth
When there´s no room in hell
The dead will walk again
A ghastly vision of our world
I can´t believe of what´s transpired
Will we live to see tomorrow?
Or will we burn in hell´s fire?
"with no room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth
When there´s no room in hell
The dead will walk again
A ghastly vision of our world
And have we heard the final bell?
It seems the dead will never rest
With no room in hell
