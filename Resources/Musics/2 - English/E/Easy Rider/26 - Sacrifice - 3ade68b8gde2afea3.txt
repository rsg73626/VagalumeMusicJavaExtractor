SACRIFICE

In the beginning there was nothing
Only the sea and the sky
Then the maker stretched a cord in between
These words I speak
On the day I must die
I must die
And I climb the great temple
I have been chosen the one
Proud I should be but the fear overcomes me
I am blood for the god of the sun
God of sun
I am their sacrifice
Ready for the afterlife
The priest prays tonight
Equinox it bears the serpent
The high priest chants as the chacs lay me down
A blade is weilded thrust upon me
From which my beating heart is passed all
Around
SoulÂ´s abound
I am their sacrifice
Ready for the afterlife
The priest preys tonight
In the biginning there was nothing
Only the sea and the sky
Then the corners of the earth were created
The priest speaks while my spirit flies
Spirit flies
I am their sacrifice
Ready for the afterlife
The priest preys tonight
I am their sacrifice
Ready for the afterlife
The priest preys tonight
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
