GOLIATH

They converged in judah for the battle plan
From the hill the philistines did shout to them
"send us one of your men, we defy israel today"
With this said they brought forth
Who they called champion
"yes fear Goliath for by him you´ll be our slaves
Behold Goliath, you will fear his name"
And they were dismayed
But one man would stay
And this was David and he took the challenge
To kill Goliath and to this he´d swear
Now king Saul told David
"the lord walks with you"
David left to meet his fate
He approached the giant
And with sling and stones in hand
He did hurl the rock and struck him down
Killed him dead
He killed Goliath, he did while others fled
Brought down Goliath and he took his head
And they were dismayed
But one man would stay
And this was David and he took the challenge
To kill Goliath and to this he kept his promise
"yes fear Goliath for by him you´ll be our slaves
Behold Goliath, you will fear his name"
And they were dismayed
But one man would stay
And this was David and he took the challenge
To kill Goliath and to this he kept his promise
