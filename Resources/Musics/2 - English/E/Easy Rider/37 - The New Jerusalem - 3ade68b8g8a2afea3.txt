THE NEW JERUSALEM

New heaven and new earth
The first ones had passed away
And there was no longer any land, any sea or any tree

I saw - Holy city
The new Jerusalem
Coming - Shinning

Wipe the tears, for the old order of things has passed away
There will be no more death, crying or pain
Write this down

I saw - Holy city
The new Jerusalem
Coming - Shinning
