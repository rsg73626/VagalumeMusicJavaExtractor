SUDDENLY

Alone, on a lonely highway I drive
The dusk it illuminates through
The clouds in the sky
It´s funny how beauty can also bring sorrow
I can´t clear these thoughts from my mind
Of that night
When suddenly
You were gone from me
It´s easy, easy to take things for granted
As we yearn for the colors of fall
When they are gone
I feel as cold as the winter upon us
Words can´t describe
How empty my world´s become
Since that night
When suddenly
You were gone from me
Suddenly
I was too blind to know you´d leave
Suddenly
You were gone from me
Suddenly
I was too blind to see
Suddenly
Baby I wish I could have made things right
Suddenly
I was too blind to know you´d leave
