WALLS OF HATRED

Stand back and just look at how our world
Still needs to be repaired
Why do we still hate do we not trust
Because we´re not the same
It´s now up to us to implement
Change for a better world
Stop sowing the seed of bigotry
You know it´s not too late
To make a world of difference
Let the colors flow let them run
Break these walls of hatred
Let´s come all together as one!
You don´t have to take the thoughts of those
Who only know to hate
Stand up for what you believe and know
We´re one and one the same
Prejudice is not born
It is taught by father to son
Break these walls of hatred
Let us come together as one!
It will take some work it always does
For there to be some change
There´s no better time no time than now
For minds to be arrange!
Stand walk hand in hand! rock with the band!
United yes we stand!
Why we´ve got to try! now is the time
For us to unify!
Prejudice is not born
It is taught by father to son
Break these walls of hatred
Let us come together as one!
To make a world of difference
Let us come together as... one!!!
