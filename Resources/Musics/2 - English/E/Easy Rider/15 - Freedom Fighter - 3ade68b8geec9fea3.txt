FREEDOM FIGHTER

Freedom fighter knows his mission
Trained to protect our free nations
Will of iron, heart of gold
You are the proud, you are the bold
Flying on eagles wings
With the cover that darkness brings
Swiftly moving in, sweeping targets
To seize and destroy
Capture, recover or inflict
Damage in strikes
Offensive operations
You´re the elite, you are the freedom fighter.
Military man in waiting
Primed for action, no hesitating
Like a panther you strike
Then you vanish in the night
A new sortie takes flight
Armed and ready
Flying on eagles wings
With the cover that darkness brings
Swiftly moving in, sweeping targets
To seize and destroy
Capture, recover or inflict
Damage in strikes
Reconnaissance operations
Risilient and skilled
Born with a raw gut desire
You´re the elite, you are the freedom fighter
Like a panther you strike
Then you vanish in the night
A new sortie takes flight
Armed and ready
Flying on eagles wings
With the cover that darkness brings
Swiftly moving in, sweeping targets
To seize and destroy
Capture, recover or inflict
Damage in strikes
Reconnaissance operations
Risilient and skilled
Born with a raw gut desire
You´re the elite, you are the freedom fighter
