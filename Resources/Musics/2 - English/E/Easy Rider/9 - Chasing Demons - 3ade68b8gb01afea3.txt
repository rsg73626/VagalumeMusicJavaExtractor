CHASING DEMONS

I wake, my body so battered
The day, it´s wasted and gone
I feel, disgusted and sick
I´ve been down that road that many
A man comes to find
Taste now the venom it´s time
No turning back, get in line
Fast forward to daybreak
The sun, it beats on my brain
I kneel and pray for the pain to go away
Forgive me father again I have sinned
Taste now the venom it´s time
The forces of evil align
Chasing demons
Chasing demons
I´m chasing demons
Hit me just once more my friend
Chasing demons
The gates behind me are closed
And i´m falling again
Once the dark veil has lifted
And i´ve sworn those demons away
I hear them calling me
No, don´t bother me
Oh what the hell just one more time
Taste now the venom it´s fine
I know the way I can bypass the line
Chasing demons
Tailing them back to their lair
Chasing demons
As trophies their heads i´ll display
Chasing demons
Hunting them down
Or maybe it´s I who´s the prey
And I live for the moment
And the moment´s now so
Taste now the venom it´s fine
Whiskey or beer or some wine
Chasing demons
Chasing demons
Chasing demons
Hit just once more my friend
Chasing demons
The sign now reads closed
I´m falling from my stool again
Chasing demons
I´ll live out this game ´till the end
