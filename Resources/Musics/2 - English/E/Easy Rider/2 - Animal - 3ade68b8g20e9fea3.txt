ANIMAL

A focus of our fascination
For centuries past humankind
Has tried to decipher the mind
So common were theories
That environmental influence
Shapes developing minds
Foregoing the obvious
Natural instinct
And if it is primal this instinct
Built in us all
Could this eventually
Lead to our fall
The animal lives inside us
Inside of me
But how close is man to beast
Wired into our subconscious
Aggression is in every beast
As the normal desire to eat
Caused by the threat of nature
Reactions can be suppressed
But only for some time
And just like a time bomb
We all can explode
As history repeats itself
And man chooses war
Will we finally cease to exist no more
The animal lives inside us
Inside of me
But how close is man to beast
And if it is primal instinct
Built in us all
Could this eventually
Lead to our fall
The animal lives inside us
Inside of me
But how close is man to beast

[Chorus x2]
