FROM THE TRIBES

Four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding back the four winds
To prevent any wind from blowing on the land
Or on the sea or on any tree

Another angel coming up from the east
Having the seal of the living God

From the tribes, those who were sealed
From all the tribes of Israel
From the tribes, those who were sealed
From all the tribes of Israel

He called out to the angels who had been given power
To harm the land and the sea

Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees
Â´Till we seal the servants of our God

From the tribes, those who were sealed
From all the tribes of Israel
From the tribes, those who were sealed
From all the tribes of Israel

Great multitude
No-one could count
From every nation
From every tribe

From the tribes, those who were sealed
From all the tribes of Israel
From the tribes, those who were sealed
From all the tribes of Israel
