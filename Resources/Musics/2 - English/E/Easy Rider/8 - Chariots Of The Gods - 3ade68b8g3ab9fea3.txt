CHARIOTS OF THE GODS

A scene of an ancient runway
Impossible dreams now reality
A calling to the heavens
For the lights they would wait
The event they came to witness was their fate
Turbulence from above
Changing winds
They knew
They would come from out of the skies
They would ride
Chariots of the gods
Astronauts from another time in space
They´d ride chariots of the gods
Bringing knowledge to the human race
The question is still disputed today
Are we alone in an universe so grand
Some say that they still watch us
That they visit from afar
We will always wonder looking
Towards the stars
Turbulence from above
Changing winds
They knew
They would come from out of the skies
They would ride
Chariots of the gods
Astronauts from another time in space
They´d ride chariots of the gods
Bringing knowledge to the human race
They would ride
Chariots of the gods
Astronauts from another time in space
They´d ride chariots of the gods
Bringing knowledge to the human race
From the heavens
