SPECTRE OF SORROW

The legend was told
Whispered from mouths of long ago
All spoke of the young bride
And her man of the sea
How he would leave each morning
And sheÂ´d wave and wish him well
She knew that each time might be goodbye forever
Then one night he did not return
From the cliffside she would learn
She could not accept
That her man would now never come home
She cried one last tear
And with the crash of a wave she was gone
Seasons did pass (like the wind)
And through the town the voices told
Of how they have seen the ghost at last
Silhouette under bright moonlight
You could hear her cry at night
Crying for her lost love
Only now, only a memory
Spectre of sorrow
From the cliff of eternity
She stands, she stands
Watching the sea
She stands, she stands
There she will be
Spectre of sorrow
From the cliff of eternity
She stands, she stands
Watching the sea
She stands, she stands
There she will be
