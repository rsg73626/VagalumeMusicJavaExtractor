WHERE ANGEL'S CRY

Figures that fly
Silently soaring through burnt orange skies
Halos that blend with the constellations that tie
The heavens and earth
These apparitions they do hear our cries
Watching over our world
Through a veil of white light
There is place above the highest of mountains
Where angels fly, where they fly
Where angels fly, where they cry
Powers divine
Sensations surround us in body in mind
Transparent wings extend our souls
Take flight
There is place far beyond this time and space
Where angels fly, where they fly
Where angels fly, where they cry
There is place above the highest of mountains
Spanning the twilight of dusk
Beyond time and space
Where angels fly, where they fly
Where angels fly, where they cry
Where angels fly, where they fly
Where angels fly, where they cry
