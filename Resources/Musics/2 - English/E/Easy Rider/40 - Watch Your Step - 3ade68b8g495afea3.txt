WATCH YOUR STEP

Hey, there´s a place where
You can leave your thoughts behind
Save them for later, so come
Let me take you
I can lead you to that place
It´s very simple so

[Bridge:]
Don´t hesitate!
Get in!
It´s nice inside yeah my car!

Dude, did you hear me
There´s trouble on your mind
Forget about it

We´ll be there in no time man
It´s very simple so
Don´t hesitate!
