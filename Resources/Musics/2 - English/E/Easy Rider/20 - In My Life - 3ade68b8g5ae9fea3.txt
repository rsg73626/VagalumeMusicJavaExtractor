IN MY LIFE

I feel alone,
Without your heart and soul
I can feel your warmth in your smile
I can hear your voice in my dreams

In my life you're everything
In my life it's love you bring
In my life you're what I see
In my life tell me…

When you say goodbye tell me how you feel…
Sometimes it's the silence that leaves me cold
You make me feel,
Like a bird flying free
Let yourself go
Come share your fantasies…
'cause you make the sunshine when it rains
'cause you make me love all your signs…

In my life you're everything
In my life it's love you bring
In my life you're all I see
In my life baby
I can feel your warmth in your smile
I can hear your voice in my dreams

In my life I feel you breathe
In my life next to me
In my life come walk with me
Walk with me into my life
