WHEN THE THOUSAND YEARS ARE OVER

Satan, heÂ´ll be released from his prison
Deceit, out to deceive the nations

God and Magog
Gather them for battle
Strength in numbers
March across the breath of the earth

Chain reaction
Fire came into the sulphur lake
False and disastrous
The second death
When the thousand years are over

Fled from this presence
There was no place for them
Life, the the book of life is opened

God and Magog
Gather them for battle
Strength in numbers
March across the breath of the earth

Chain reaction
Fire came into the sulphur lake
False and disastrous
The second death
When the thousand years are over

The dead, just a word into the books
The angels
Were burn into the lake of fire

God and Magog
Gather them for battle
Strength in numbers
March across the breath of the earth

Chain reaction
Fire came into the sulphur lake
False and disastrous
The second death
When the thousand years are over
