SEE MY EYES

(The oakwood)

Thunder and lightning
Shaking the air tonight
Blinded by fear...
Spectres rise from below

Wait for me father
We´ll meet in the sky
By glory and honour I´m sworn
I´ll fly into the blackness
Of the enchanted forest
Magic can´t stop me now

Can´t see the sun... Bloodshot
Fierce is my hate

Frightful voices keep quiet
The oakwood waits for the attack
A harmful smell of death suffocate me
Cold inside my bones

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
Visions dance through the night

See my eyes
Look into the fear
See my eyes
Shoikan oakwood
