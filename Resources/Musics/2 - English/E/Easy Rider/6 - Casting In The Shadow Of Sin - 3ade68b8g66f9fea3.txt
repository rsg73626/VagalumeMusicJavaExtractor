CASTING IN THE SHADOW OF SIN

A light cascades on my face
Just like a blind man whose eyesight
Has been returned once again
Shocked from my first sight of the sun
Since I was banished and shamed
Goodbye darkness
I have been washed of my sins
A holy choir of voices familiar to me
Sweet memories calling me
Out from the black
No more
Sadness nor pain
Dark desire
Tempting
I´m just a mortal
Who is the one
Casting the shadow
Look I thyself
I see
What do you see
Peace within me
Judgement
Day is behind me
Who is the one
Casting the shadow of sin
Although time fades my scars remain
Angel´s wings singed by the fire
Tears of blood from my eyes
Hardened is my soul forever
I turn my back now on those
Who pass judgement
For they stand cold and alone
A holy choir of voices familiar to me
Sweet memories calling me
