STRANGER

Lights out, we live in darkness
Sunlight cuts like a blade
Pale skin betrays my still life
Downward of the devil´s son
There´s a life to die in hell
Be reborn and die in the same day
I´m running through the night
Shadows in the shades of grey
Strolling through the road to ruin it is my life
The moon is black when you´re in Halloween
Immortal sin taste in the air
Always running like a stranger in the night
Inner voices tell you´re a...
Stranger... stranger... stranger
Downward of the devil´s son
There´s a life to die in hell
Be reborn and die in the same day
Taste the blood of human race
Underworld on the surface
Imaginations from the other side
When the light begins to fade
Apparitions rise in mind
Psychotic tendencies invade your way of life
The moon is black when you´re in Halloween
Immortal sin taste in the air
Always running like a stranger in the night
Inner voices tell you´re a...
Stranger... stranger... stranger
Lights out, we live in darkness
Sunlight cuts like a blade
Pale skin betrays my still life
Taste the blood of human race
Underworld on the surface
Imaginations from the other side
There appears Mr. Hyde
Full moon in the air
I´m a vampire; my blood runs through your veins
The moon is black when you´re in Halloween
Immortal sin taste in the air
Always running like a stranger in the night
Inner voices tell you´re a...
The moon is black when you´re in Halloween
Immortal sin taste in the air
Always running like a stranger in the night
Inner voices tell you´re a...
Stranger... stranger... stranger
