ETERNAL SIN

Awakening in my cold room
Another day waiting ´till
Redemption sets me free
Long and useless waiting
Memories come to my mind
Guilt inside my heart

Eternal sin tormentor
The torture never stops
I can´t go on
I´d wish to think
It´s only a nightmare in a dream
So hard to feel no pain

Dying day by day
Unconscious life when there´s no fate
Uncoloured shades of grey
If I could go back in time
If I could change what I made wrong
If I could live my life
