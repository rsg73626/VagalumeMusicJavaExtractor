VISION

She was a mystery
Those she´d touch believed
If you seek to know her name
She goes by the one who knows
The one who knows
The one who knows
Of the unknown
From what I learned and what´s been told
Blind at birth and yet she could she
Within her mind the scenes would unfold
Forever cursed she´d be
The one who knows
The one who knows
Of the unknown
Visions they haunt her
Predictions they haunt her more
Oh no more
Oh no more
Oh no more
No more
[repeat]
Visions disturb her
Predictions of murder
Visions of blood red skies they flow
