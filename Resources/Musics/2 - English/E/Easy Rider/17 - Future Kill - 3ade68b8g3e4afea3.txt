FUTURE KILL

Seems like it was only
Yesterday when life was day to day
Things we took for granted
Somewhat ignorant and
Sheltered from oppression and of pain
Looking back at least I
Know how fortunate we were
Tranquil memories they
Wash away the ugly scenes
That won´t dissappear
They´re now all that I see
If I close my eyes
Just a moment I can fly away
Shot down from the sky
My escape is shattered by the hell I hear
A massive clap of thunder
Breaks the silence ripping through the streets
I reack instinctly
Running my heart pounding
Smoke engulfs the city
My eyes burn i´m gasping I can´t breathe
Just what have we done
To bring this devastation
Future kill
Is this the end of things to come
Life stands still
It´s now too late
Too late for discussions
Resolutions cast aside
How could peace prevail when
There are those so hellbent
In keeping their own people poor
And using greed for their sole gain
My thoughts shattered again
Screaming persons running through the streets
This day holds no mercy
Death is all that I see
As if in a nightmare
I feel as though i´m running standing still
Buildings crashing burning
Earth beneath me moving

[Chorus:]
Future kill
Is this the end of things to come
Life stands still
What have we done

[Chorus]
