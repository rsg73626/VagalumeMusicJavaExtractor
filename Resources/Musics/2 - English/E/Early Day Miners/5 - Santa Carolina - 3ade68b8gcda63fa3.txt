SANTA CAROLINA

california dust golden day
a thousand blackened hours
vacant soul
river blinding white
over flattened land
conversation drives
faith in reward
water running slow
returning from
distant falling rains
motion holds
amber glow
horizon light
faith in the reward
a prize trough palace gates
an end to suffering the pain
acceptance of who we are
at terms with whose at fault
where to place the blame
