CENTRALIA

monumental masterpiece
fading in the sun
picture windows billboard signs
to view when something's wrong
rusted river towns
twisted metal lines
power lines pull grey skies down
falling through the air
children playing figure skating
snowfall covered lawns
monday morning without warning
the face to face the pain
infrastructure
the neon lights
hands spinning out of time
echoed laughter
the sirens wail and then fade
