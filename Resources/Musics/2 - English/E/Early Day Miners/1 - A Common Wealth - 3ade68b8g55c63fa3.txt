A COMMON WEALTH

forgotten faith
dreaming of space
covered retraced
remember the way
failing with doubt
they journeyed without
courageous unsure
on borrowed time
weathered the days
no end to the line
turning their backs
forests of black
cumberland gap
nights laid in wait
morning unfolds
fiery cold
winding throughout
retracing their steps
forging the path
horizons of stone
remembered your name
recalling your face
unable to say
unable to speak
to see you again
