OFFSHORE

Hurricane windswept march
A road leading to the sea
A landmark for defeat
Ghost waltz fishing camp
Her presence and her delta eyes
Stained glass mystery
Abandoned boats drift by
Stillness and debris
Security light
The thundercast
White heat and misery
Twisted trail of fire
We're losing you to your desire
In rooms with ocean views
A family in peril
Broken destroyed within
Parades and worn concrete
Rusted oak and dragonflies
A masquerade ball
A mardi gras mask
A cheap facade
White heat and misery
