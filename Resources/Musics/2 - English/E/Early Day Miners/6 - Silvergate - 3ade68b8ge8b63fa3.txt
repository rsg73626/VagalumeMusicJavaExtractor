SILVERGATE

it's cold outside
isolation in the wild
many mountains to climb
to silvergate
where the days are wild
night falls fast and dark inside
the stillness awaits
in a barren mine
where our fathers dig
to uncover their sons alive
a snow melt in spring
an avalanche
a rescue attempt in vain
the stillness waits in silvergate
