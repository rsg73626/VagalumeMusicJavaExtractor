SUMMER ENDS

autumn falling
the seasons change
i'll change your mind
focused within
an open space
a wounded los
this reckless life
i wondered lost
stretched into lines
a willowed stare
the windshield dries
from desert sun
the station blurs
dreaming awake
pale morning sun
a colored dawn
scorched and burned
for the time
for what's left
for the sameness
that's overhead
for the air
that's all alone
for the seasons
woven time
the station blurs
dreaming awake
pale morning sun
a colored dawn
scorched and burned
