STRAIGHT LINES

I can't say sorry for being myself
But a little less of me
Might be better for my health
My sneakers are round for time
But they still work just fine
Why I'am moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines
Moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines

I got into a subway, I got off in seattle
Forgot to get some sleep
And I wake up kind of raddle
I can't planning the day 'cause
I don't know the time
Why I'am moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines
Moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines

24 Years is too much time
The city it's too noisy
The country is too quiet
Why I'am moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines
Moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines

Moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines
Moving in circles
When I'am looking for straight lines
