MY LIFE IN REWIND

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Da-da-da-da-da-da

A thousand regrets rushed right by
They strike like a last goodbye
There's no other weight this kind
If only I could press rewind

Painting with tears from my eyes
Wonder which ways I'd of climbed
Open my orchestral mind
Cartwheeling back through my
My life in rewind

As sand in the eggtimer slides
Now twisting and turning reversed inside
You made me swim to the parts
That are dark and resign
Now wishing I'd just changed my mind
Winding up blaming my type
Reflecting in spite, I tried
A hundred and one of the lies I've signed
I'm blinded, now I pressed rewind

Painting with tears from my eyes
Wonder which ways I'd of climbed
Open my orchestral mind
Cartwheeling back through my
My life in rewind

My life in rewind

Painting the pain in the frames of our hearts
As tears dripping out of our face become art
Watching the world fly by

Painting with tears from my eyes
Wonder which ways I'd of climbed
Open my orchestral mind
Cartwheeling back through my
My life in rewind

Watching the world fly by
Trawl through the depths of my
