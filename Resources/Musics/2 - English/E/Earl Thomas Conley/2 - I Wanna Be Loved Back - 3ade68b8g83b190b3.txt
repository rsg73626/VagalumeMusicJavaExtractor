I WANNA BE LOVED BACK

Take another shot of gold tequila
Lie to me and say your love is real
Then roll me down that long hard road to freedom
Oh but freedom ain't the word for what I feel

You don't have to hurt me to remind me
That this living on the edge ain't where's it's at
I just wanna put the worst behind me
I just wanna love and be loved back

I wanna be loved back
I wanna be loved back

When the nighttime falls the bright lights draw
Two hearts together

I just wanna be loved back
Just wanna be loved back

Will you still be mine every time
I wanna be loved back

Solo

So talk to me and tell me what you're thinking
Tell me should I go or should I stay
Staring out across that blue horizon
Oh we're just too close to feel that far away

I wanna be loved back
I just wanna be loved back

I want a heart that cares a love to share
A lifetime together

I just wanna be loved back
Just wanna be loved back

Will you still be mine every time

I wanna be loved back

Will you still be mine every time
G
I wanna be loved back
