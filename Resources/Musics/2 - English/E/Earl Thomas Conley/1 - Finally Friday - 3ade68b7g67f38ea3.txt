FINALLY FRIDAY

I got a hundred dollars smokin' in my billfold
I know i ought to save it but it's burnin' a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come monday morning i'll be broke again
Chorus
It's finally friday i'm free again
I got my motor runnin' for a wild weekend
It's finally friday i'm out of control
Forget the western blues and let the good times roll
I've got a little sugar baby down the road
Sittin' on ready and rockin' on dough
We'll dance up a storm and later on tonight
Be workin' on doin' all the wrong things right
Chorus
Monday i'll be hurtin' with my head in a vice
Tuesday i'll be wonderin' if i'll ever survive
Wednesday and thursday i'll be slowly tunin' in
Friday i'll be revvin' up my motor again...
Finally friday i'm free again
I got my motor runnin' for a wild weekend
It's finally friday i'm out of control
Forget the western blues and let the good times roll
It's finally friday
I got my motor runnin' for a wild weekend
It's finally friday
Forget the western blues and let the good times roll...
