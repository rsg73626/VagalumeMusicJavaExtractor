WASTELAND

For so many years you were locked away
And you never really got the opportunity
To blossom, and pass on your masterpiece creation

They're so ignorant, they don't understand
You were always longing for a chance
To abandon this wasteland and never have to pretend
Everything's okay
And you're the same as everybody else

So stop apologizing
There's nothing wrong with being different
Despite their accusations
You've always proven that you're better

Take a look around, everything you see
Is their twisted version of reality
They live in, and you've been forced to believe them

Erase your memories from so long ago
Now you're capable of so much more
Just let go, now you know exactly what you're here for

Everything's okay
You're not the same as everybody else

So stop apologizing
There's nothing wrong with being different
Despite their accusations
You've always proven that you're better
