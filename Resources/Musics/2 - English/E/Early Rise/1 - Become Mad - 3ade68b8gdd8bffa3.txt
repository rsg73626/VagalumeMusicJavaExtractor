BECOME MAD

Hiding quietly in my room
I was hoping you wouldn't be back so soon
Felt my heart pounding as I crawled
Slowly on the floor

Felt your presence piercing through
Guess I was never good enough for you
Your shouting made me feel so small
Desperate, insecure

There's no room left for me in this shelter
What did you expect me to become?
No more than a disciplined little soldier
Left no space for me to grow
So I had to break away

It was getting harder to fall asleep
Tried to let go but I was in too deep
Then I started to realize
Something's wrong with me

My point of view got all twisted up
You couldn't see I was crying out for help
Treated me like I'm second best
Now I trust no one but myself

There's no room left for me in this shelter
What did you expect me to become?
No more than a disciplined little soldier
Left no space for me to grow
So I had to break away

Swallowed my pride
I was frozen inside
Just wanted to be free to decide
Will you disappear?
I need you to stay away from me

There's no room left for me in this shelter
What did you expect me to become?
No more than a disciplined little soldier
Left no space for me to grow
So I had to break away
