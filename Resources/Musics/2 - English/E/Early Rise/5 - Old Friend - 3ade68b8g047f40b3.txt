OLD FRIEND

Hello old friend, do you still think of me?
And how I used to be?
We never went too far
I can't stand the thought
Of being with anyone but you
But I can still remember all the pain that you put me through
Through

And I've got so much left to say
Say
Don't want this all to fade away
Yeah, yeah
And I've got so much left to say
Say
Don't want this all to fade away
Yeah, yeah

It's been so long yet you won't talk to me
You act so differently
Wonder if you care
Looking back, retracing every single step we made
Was there anything I could have said or done to make you stay?
Stay

And I've got so much left to say
Say
Don't want this all to fade away
Yeah, yeah
And I've got so much left to say
Say
Don't want this all to fade away
Yeah, yeah

Guess it's too late to fix my mistakes
And now you're nowhere in sight
Moved on with your life
Left me in the past
Forgot about my existence

Guess it's too late to fix my mistakes
And now you're nowhere in sight
And it's hard to admit, but I have to let go
It's time to say "goodbye, my friend"

Goodbye, my friend
