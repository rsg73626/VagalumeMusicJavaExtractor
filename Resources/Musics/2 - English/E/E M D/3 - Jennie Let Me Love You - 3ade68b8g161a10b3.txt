JENNIE LET ME LOVE YOU

I've been waiting for my luck to turn
For my heart to burn again
I've been praying
But I should have known
That you're not alone tonight

You should know that I am head over heels for you
For you

Jennie let me love you
You know I'll do anything for you
I know that you belong to yeah
A man who doesn't deserve you
You know I'll be true
Jennie let me love you
Jennie let me love you

You've been crying
And you can't pretend
That his love will mend your life
And now you're lying between my twisted sheets
And you're sore heart beats with mine

You should know that I am head over heels for you
For you

Jennie let me love you
You know I'll do anything for you
I know that you belong to yeah
A man who doesn't deserve you
You know I'll be true
Jennie let me love you
Jennie let me love you

In the dead of night
You know that I will be waiting
Gotta let you know
I'm head over heals for you

For you

Jennie let me love you
You know I'll do anything for you
I know that you belong to yeah
A man who doesn't deserve you

Jennie let me love you
You know I'll do anything for you
I know that you belong to yeah
A man who doesn't deserve you

You know I'll be true
Jennie let me love you
