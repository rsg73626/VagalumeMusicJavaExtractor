BURNING

I don't think I know you
Don't think I ever will
Am I in love with you?
Well, I don't know still
It may sound strange, but I'm warning you
I may not be that nice

Maybe, baby, I'm a heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart of ice

But I'm burning, burning
'cause you set my soul on fire
Girl, I don't know what I'll do
'cause I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning with desire
Yes, I'm burning
And it's all because of you

We can't be together
I'm not that kind of guy
I'll be gone and lost forever
And you won't know why
Don't get me wrong, I'm only warnin' you
You'll be on your own

Maybe, baby, I'm a heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart of stone

'cause I'm burning, burning
'cause you set my soul on fire
Girl, I don't know what I'll do
'cause I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning with desire
Yes, I'm burning
And it's all because of you
Because of you

'cause I'm burning, burning
'cause you set my soul on fire
Girl, I don't know what I'll do
'cause I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning with desire
Yes, I'm burning
And it's all because of you
Because of you

Girl, I don't know what I'll do
'cause I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning with desire
Yes, I'm burning
And it's all because of you

Don't think I know you
Don't think I ever will
