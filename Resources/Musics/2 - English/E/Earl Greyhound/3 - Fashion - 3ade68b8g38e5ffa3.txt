You can covet another man's wife
You can lay with a stranger, court death and danger
But you cannot hide from the eyes of cassandra

Make deals with the devil, speak under and over the level
Fill the children's minds with fright
Stir the ire of the scornful, make refuge in minds of the mournful
But you cannot hide from the eyes of cassandra

Do your deeds dark and cunning, paint your moods black and bloody
Cut your lifeline, quick and cover your eyes
Though you may not believe her you may never deceive her
No you cannot hide from the eyes of cassandra

Like all warriors I have hated what I have done
And lost I agreed to forget and in fear not see what I'd become
But I cannot hide
I cannot hide

You can covet another man's wife
You can lay with a stranger, court death and danger
