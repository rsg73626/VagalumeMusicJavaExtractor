BACK AND FORTH

I was lonely
Cast the first stone
Don’t show your hands to me I know where you’ve been
You say you was borderline
Outcast and concubine
Mixed up your friends and mine and did what you did
Yeah me I was holding out
Lest you should come around
Then I grew sober and I did what I did
Still I am lonely and I can’t find my coat can’t cross back to shore
and in case you care what I think

Hell I’m back and forth
I can’t tell which one’s worse yet
Growing cruel to each other
Or stand crying there’s no other

I was lonely
Passed my way home
Don’t put your glass to me you know what this is
You say you was always right
Mixed up but more the wise
Sipped down your holy wine and did what you did
Yeah me I was waiting on
The chance that you’d come around
Then I took over and I did what I did

Still I am lonely and I can’t find my coat can’t get up off the floor
And if you care what I think

Hell I’m back and forth
I can’t tell which one’s worse yet
Growing cruel to each other
Or stand crying there’s no other

I get so mixed up so sad I can’t tell which one’s worse
I’m hoping that you’ll come back home this time
It’s the same hasn’t changed
I still can’t explain why I feel so ashamed
I don’t care so much now baby I don’t want to complicate it
I only want you there to see that I love you when I forget about me

Hell I’m back and forth
I can’t tell which one’s worse yet
Growing cruel to each other
Or stand crying there’s no other
Hell I’m back and forth
I can’t tell which one’s worse yet
Growing cruel to each other
Or stand crying there’s no other
