NOT GONNA WAIT

702, yeah
Yeah

Oh why, oh why so stupid of me
To take you back so easily
I'm going going out of my mind
To take you back a second time

Why must you put me through
So much heartache and pain
Tell me am I insane
To let you do me this way

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

Oh no, oh no how dumb could I be
To think that you love me
These lies all the time
I should've known you weren't mine

Why must you put me through
So much heartache and pain
Tell me am I insane
To let you do me this way

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

Oh no, oh no where did you go
Why did you leave me all alone
You're spending most of your time
With other tricks on your mind

I've got to find me a new guy
Got to find me, a new guy, see I, can do it again
I've got to find me a new guy
Got to find me, a new guy, see I, can do it again

Look what you've done to me
You broke my heart
You put a burden on me
So torn apart

Look what you've done to me
You broke my heart
You put a burden on me
So torn apart

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game

I'm not gonna take you back
'cause boy I don't play that
No matter what you say
You treat love like a game
