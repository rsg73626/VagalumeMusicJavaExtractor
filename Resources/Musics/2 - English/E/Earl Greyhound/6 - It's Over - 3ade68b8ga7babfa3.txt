IT'S OVER

I don’t want your understanding anymore
I got fistfuls in my hands to enjoy
So release me if you can
You got your police grip in my pants I ignored

I wondered what words won’t make you cry ‘til now
I wanted to want you in my life somehow
I’m losing a look that was in my eyes
Lovers are strangers in disguise for a while

But now it’s over let go of it
Our love gets colder the closer we get
Now child don’t hold on cause you know we’re only gonna get older

I feel a bit better everyday now alone
I wish you would wake up feeling the same
But I got to relate
If not for your fitness when I’d fall
But cause you remained a witness when I was drunk

But now it’s over let go of it
Our love gets colder the closer we get
Now child don’t hold on cause you know we’re only gonna get older

I been aching to show you
Don’t forget what I told you
I can wing it alone and resist your love

I’ve been aching to show you
I can wing it alone
I can wait so I’ll hug you and
Sing you one last song
Then I should break cause I know you
And how you drag this on and on and on and on and on
