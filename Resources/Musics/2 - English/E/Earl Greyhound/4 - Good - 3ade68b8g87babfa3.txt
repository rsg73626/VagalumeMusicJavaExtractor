GOOD

ow that a rose is the cancer I know
Black in the night she come asking for more
Summer a squall and the banshee she moans
Come measure this pleasure without your good sense
It’s almost never what you may want to have guessed

No you you’re good you’re good you’re good you’re good you’re good you’re good

Astor the moon she rests her face on the floor
She came in through the window
Now that she’s out she rolls her way to the door
She got farther than we know
Into the light a dresser spills out a drawer
Just like a casino
We’ve test the pressure of the water and air
It’s almost better now you’re with her in there

No you you’re good you’re good you’re good you’re good you’re good you’re good

This I swear you’re the only one I’d risk my fortune and heir for
If you’re good to me
When I compare all my lonliness to chance of what may be
I see I’m a fool to care
