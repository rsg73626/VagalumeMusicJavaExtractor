S.O.S

I pulled these drapes walked these floors once before
At first I couldn’t place it but now I’m sure of it
And down the street now it occurs to me
There should be pairs of shoes hung from wires in memorial
That’s all I can recollect from east to west
I got to move or get on to where I’m going
so where you gonna go?
I could swear we were close to home
Or am I on Jupiter just waving my arms at you
I s.o.s. across the universe
I got this bit rehearsed
Don’t know which signals that I’m throwing talking robotics to nobody
I s.o.s. across the universe
I get you all to watch 'til we get heard
I shut these gates locked these doors braced for more
And it first I couldn’t face it get on with it I told you
I got wherewithal to leap from beach to beach
I got the shoes not the fire of a warrior
So I keep sifting through this sand from fist to hand
And I’ll keep digging at my seat ‘til the waters meet
And below below I hear them s.o.s. beneath from each to each
I s.o.s. across the universe
I get you all to watch til we get heard
Now once the worlds start to roll
I get a little below
Just a little bit too low
Right this way I want to feel this rain
