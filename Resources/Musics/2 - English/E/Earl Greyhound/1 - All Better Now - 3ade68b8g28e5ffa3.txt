ALL BETTER NOW

I'm with stupid
All over now
Though I let you steer
You a cavalier
Inch became a lightyear
It was pathetic
Oh you can write the play
And every word I say
But I don't have to stay
To see the credits

'cause it's all over now
Yes it's all over now
And I'm free

I was one of few
Who'd stick up for you
And so you never knew
You were a punch line
I could not convince or trust you
To pick up on my hints, must you
Leave your fingerprints
On everything I called mine

Well that's all over now
Yes it's all over now
And I'm free
Yes I'm free

From your interference
Which had the appearance
Of making it clear that
It's got nothing to do with me
