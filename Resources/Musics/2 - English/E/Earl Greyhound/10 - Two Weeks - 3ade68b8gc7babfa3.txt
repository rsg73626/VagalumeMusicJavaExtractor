TWO WEEKS

Two weeks alone
Two lovers alone in bed
Said she's gonna escape today
Gonna make it a break for it,
And run to stall this ordinary role by role everyday

I'm on your side when you're running away
We go back to get lost and start over again,
You can't hide from that soldier in a world that has no end,
Don't be dry, we're pushovers, we just hitchhike our way back to what we know.
And so it goes.

Two weeks alone,
So your lover is gone again,
Said she's gone to the race today,
Today she's gonna just waste away,
And run to stall what she knows is very well
That hell on to the way

I'm on your side when you're running away,
We go back to get lost and start over again,
You can't hide from the soldier in a world that has no end
Don't be dry, we're pushovers, we just hitchhike our way back to what we know.

I'm on your side when you're running away,
We go back to get lost and start over again,
You can't hide from the soldier in a world that has no end
Don't be dry, we're pushovers,
Gonna kick it, it's original savior
I can't let you want to walk alone
I won't get your back from where you want to
Give me what you are.
