PEOPLE COME, PEOPLE GO

It has been told
So many time
Over and over again
'Bout nights and days to come

Isn't it time
Norwegian woman
You give to understand
The twilight of the Gods

After all the frozen years
Fire scorched the crystal gate
The nightly god fights helplessly
Against the wolf who's growin' strong
Silence - all is lost
The time will come that after all
Sunshine feeds the brand new world

Only the honeymoon
turned out to be right
Heading for home
The first fight
Echos of the same old song
Why should I want your love
When your heart doesn't belong
To the one who's been giving you love
I can't stand it no more
Wanna walk out the door
Don't blame it on me
I just wanna be free

It isn't easy nowadays to get along
We are controlled by mechanical minds
And before you know
what's really goin' on
It's only a matter of time
Instead of a name we've got a number
The beginnin' of the end
I can't stand it no more
I wanna walk out the door
Don't blame it on me
I just wanna be free

The eight o'clock news is tellin' me more
About the people who are tryin' to restore
The balance of nature, the human ideal
It's life we should adore
There's so much spillin' and so much killin
'When will it stop
I can't stand it no more
I wanna walk out the door
Don't blame it on me
I just wanna be free

When will it be
No tears will fall
Happiness is all you see

When will it be
Like a mother and a child
Gettin' back identity

People come and people go
Having a place in the whole big show
No one who can tell you when
It's all enclosed in nature's plan

When will it be
No tears will fall
Happiness is all you see

When will it be
People will see
Love is the only key

People come and people go
Having a place in this whole big show
They're all trying to survive
Don't give a damm 'bout the mission in life
No one who can tell you when
IT's all enclosed in nature's plan

When will it be
No tears will fall
Happiness is all you see
Smilin' faces you and me
Reality fills fantasy

When will it be
People will see
Love is the only key
To live in perfect harmony
