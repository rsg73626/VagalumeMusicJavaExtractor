THE TWO OF US

San Francisco night
Hot streets and neon lights
The summer city glows

It was in Nick's salloon
You paid the bill to soon
Made up my mind to go

But something in your eyes
It took me by surprise
O yeah it turned my head around

Along the riverside
We kissed you held me tight
Two lovin' people in the night

I can't tell what makes me feel so glad
Could it be the times that we once had
The atmosphere the scenery
The good air or the luxury
Of one thing I am sure

O yes, I'm sure it's just the two of us
You and I were lovers at first sight
Happiness and fun just for the two of us
How these very moments made us high

City life goes fast
Before you know it's passed
When you are downtown

Your first hello to me
Did not impress me
Gee you were acting like a clown

But something in your eyes
It took me by surprise
O yeah it turned my head around

San Francisco bay
What made us feel that way
It's magic in a passion play
