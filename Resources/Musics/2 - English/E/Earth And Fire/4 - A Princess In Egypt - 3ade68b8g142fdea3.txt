A PRINCESS IN EGYPT

She has sent her warrior on
a mission with evil intention
To get rid of her wasted love
His courage could'nt overcome
the vicious treason
The man was slaughtered,
completely lost

She has found the way to
satisfy her passionate desire
And her wedding-dress
was shining in the sun
Tuning with the harp of a blind man
Prophesying about love

About love, about sorrow
About the gate to infinity

Broken banners, split shields
The court of the snake was defeated
Lamentations along the border of the Nile

The princess was taken into slavery
in loneliness, in emptiness, in bitterness
