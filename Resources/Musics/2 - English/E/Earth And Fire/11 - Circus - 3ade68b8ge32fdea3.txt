CIRCUS

How does it feel
When you're on your own
And you're looking at
yesterday's pieces
How long will it take
to forget the love you had
Someone you met
What can you do
Remember a face your love
could depend on
Or remember the days
your love couldn't hold on

How does it feel
When you're found a home
And you're thinking of
yesterday's pieces
You've closed the door
behind things that were before
And wonder what's true
What can you do

You live for today,
a new day tomorrow
You put on your face
'cause the show must go on

Life is like a circus,
while the world is spinning round
And round and round
in circles till the end of time
You've painted your face,
The ring is your place
The laugh of the clown
goes round in the circus
it sounds like he wonders
'Is this serving my purpose?
