STORM AND THUNDER

Darkness of the night has gone
A blackbird sings a song at dawn
Crystal drops of morning dew
are covering all the grass
The landscape wears its morningdress

The foliage of the wood shines bright
As green as emerald's light
Over the fields vibrating air
causes a faintly glance
Some cows are grazing near a fence

While lowering clouds accumalate
Midges dancing above the lake
The haymakers, they go away
hiding for a storm
A flash of lightening struck

Storm and thunder
Beat the nature
Down gushes the rain
and wind cracks the trees
