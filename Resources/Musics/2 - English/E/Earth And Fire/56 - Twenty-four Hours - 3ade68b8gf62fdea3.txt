TWENTY-FOUR HOURS

Twenty four hours make
a brandnew day
Twenty four times a game you play
Love is more and you know it's true
It doesn't take one, but it takes two

When you're gone
In my heart and in my brain
I wonder is it in vain
Does our love remain?
Oon and on
So many feelings appear
So many doubts and fears
Still I wish you were here
Home again
You only show a feelin'
of compassion

Twenty four hours make
a brandnew day
Twenty four times a game you play
Love is more and you know it's true
It doesn't take one, but it takes two

My love was more than
rather accidental
It wasn't just another love-affair
My love was more physical than mental
I'm so sorry, but you were not there

I tried to tell you that i love you
But an answer never came
I tried to tell you what I fear
But you just didn't hear

Twenty four hours make
a brandnew day
Twenty four times a game you play
Love is more and you know it's true
It doesn't take one, but it takes two
