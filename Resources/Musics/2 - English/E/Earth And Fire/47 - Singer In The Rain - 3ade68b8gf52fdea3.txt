SINGER IN THE RAIN

Everytime I look at you
I do realise
I really wanna share your life
And everytime I see you
In so many different ways
In spite of nasty things
There's a smile upon your face

You are the singer in the rain
I bet you never will complain
When someone's gonna tell you
it's no,no no
You're a genius without fame
Proving day by day again
that you're the winner of the game
And at times when I was really down
You helped me breaking the walls
that troubled my mind, so long

Everytime I hear your laughing
I do realise
That's the sunshine in my life
And every time we're talking 'bout
so many different ways
Thought they aren't all that good
There's a smile upon your face

You are the singer in the rain
I bet you never will complain
When someone's gonna tell you
it's no,no,no
You're a genius without fame
Proving day by day again
that you're the winner of the game
And at times when I was really down
You helped me breaking the walls
that troubled my mind, so long
