UNDER A BURNING SKY

A house full of strangers
People coming from everywhere
Taking their chances
You pay your dues and you
got your share

No one knows who's the
first on to fall
Only time will decide who's
the last one to call

Dance on
Under a burning sky
Forget the world around you
There's only you and I
We won't surrender now
We're gonna win this fight
We're gonna make it somehow
In the heat of the night

The city's on fire but the music goes on
Only the strong will survive
Our chance is a million to one

The band is still playing
Your body's aching, so hard to move
Entranced by the rhythm
Just float in my arms, we've
got nothing to loose
