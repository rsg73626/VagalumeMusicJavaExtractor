TELL ME WHY

First time that I saw you honey
You gave me no guarentee
Still to me it seems so funny
I felt what love means to me
To me it doesn't matter
what you did before
Your feelings told me much more

But tell me why I am crying
when you tell me I love you
Is it all a lie
Tell me why are you grinning
when we're talking about love
Ooh I wonder

Loving you is not an easy thing to do
But what can I do to make a change
I have a feeling that if we don't agree
If we don't turn on
there's no more you and me

So if we will stay together
Please show your feelings to me
I'll be sure it's getting better
isn't it what loving should be
To me it doesn't matter
what you did before
Your feelings told me much more

But tell me why I am crying
when you tell me I love you
Is it all a lie
Tell me why are you grinning
when we're talking about love
Ooh I wonder

Loving you is not an easy thing to do
But what can I do to make a change
I have a feeling that if we don't agree
If we don't turn on
there's no more you and me
