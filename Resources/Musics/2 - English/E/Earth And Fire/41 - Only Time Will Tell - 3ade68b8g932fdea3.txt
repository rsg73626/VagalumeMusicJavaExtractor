ONLY TIME WILL TELL

The general teaches his soldiers
They know how to kill
The preacher teaches his children
That life matters still

Only time will tell
Why these things are side by side
Only time will tell
Why they're like day and night

The scientist tears the flower
And lets it die
The poet loves it's beauty
A treasure for his eye

The man takes a woman
He burns her love away
The loser accepts his fate
He's love in a way
