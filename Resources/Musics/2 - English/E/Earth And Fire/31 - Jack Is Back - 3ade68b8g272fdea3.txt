JACK IS BACK

Jack is back he blew it all along
We knew it on his own
Without his friends again
A disapointed man

Jack is lookin' for action
Love and affection
He is wonderin' why
It's so hard to get by
Workin' at daytime
So he can really swing it at night

He goes in his car
Has to pay in the bar
He is wonderin' why
It's so hard to bet by 'cause
Friends nowadays they
Really can swing it at night

At night he's great,
he's always great
Swingin' away
But on the job he's late,
he's always late
Dreamin' away
So now they send him away,
send him away
And somebody's else is
takin' his place

Jack is back he blew it all along
We knew it on his own
Without his friends again
A disapointed man

Still he's looking for action
Love and affection
He is wonderin' why
It's so hard to get by
On sunset boulevard
He's reachin 'for a fallin' star

At night he's great,
he's always great
Swingin' away
But on the job he's late,
he's always late
Dreamin' away
So now they send him away,
send him away
And somebody's else is
takin' his place

Jack is back he blew it all along
We knew it on his own
Without his friends again
A disapointed man
