SEASONS

There were times before
the skies were blue
Before the sun could burn the dew
Times without years and seasons

But then when the seasons
were there
All kinds of vibrations in the air
The sky was blue
And no scar on the velvet skin

Winter: hoar-frost on the trees
I thin I’ll stay asleep for another week
Summer: I can’t protect myself
from the heat
I think I’ll find myself a shady seat

There were times before the
day was born
Before the rain could drown
the lawn
Times without years and seasons

But then when the seasons
were there
All kinds of vibrations in the air
The rain was wet
Transparent and like glass

Autumn: sparrows in the sky
While the leaves of the
branches are dying
Spring: sound of a new born life
I think I’m moving on ‘cause it’s time

There were times before the
skies were blue
Before the sun could burn the dew
Times without years and
times without seasons

There were times before the
skies were blue
Before the sun could burn the dew
Times without years and
times without seasons
