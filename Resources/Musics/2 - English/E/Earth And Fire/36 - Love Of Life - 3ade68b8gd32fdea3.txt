LOVE OF LIFE

Why don't you give me love like before
Oh you know it hurts me so
Why don't you pay attention to me
L ike you used to do before
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you
Can you give me love of life?

I thought that we could make it, yeah
But now I feel so insecure
Don't deceive me, tell me straight
If you don't love me anymore
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you
Can you give me love of life?

What's going on in your mind these days
So long I've tried to understand
Ooh, I hate this slipping away
Won't you please take my hand
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you

Can you give me love of life?
Time has opened my eyes
And now i realize

Why did you let me down
why did you let me down
in love of life
