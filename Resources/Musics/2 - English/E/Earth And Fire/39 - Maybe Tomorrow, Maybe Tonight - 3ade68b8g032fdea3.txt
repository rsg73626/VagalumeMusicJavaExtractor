MAYBE TOMORROW, MAYBE TONIGHT

When the time will come
that the birds return
The season is on the turn
And the blossom
is adorning the land
My loneliness, my darling
will come to an end

Maybe tomorrow, maybe tonight
It's such a wonderful feeling
when your back on my side

When the sunshine
So bright and clean
Will make trees turn into green
Our love will turn into what we intend
My loneliness my darling
will come to an end

Maybe tomorrow, maybe tonight
It's such a wonderful feeling
when your back on my side

Maybe tomorrow, maybe tonight
It's such a wonderful feeling

The time has come
that birds returned
The season is on the turn
and blossom is adorning the land
My loneliness, my darling
will come to an end
