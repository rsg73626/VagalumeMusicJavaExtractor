WHAT'S YOUR NAME

Here I go
Let the sea ease my mind
Here I am
Just to see what I can find
Here the seagulls fly
On past the crimson ball
Their wings flash red
At the deep blue purple sky

It was a beatiful day
It was a beatiful day
While the wheels of time
Grind my mind away
Tell me, tell me
What’s your name

Hear the symphony
That echoes in my brain
While birds and flies
Play a happy game
Here I go
To the surface of the earth
Here I am
I’m going back to work

It was a beatifull day
It was a beatiful day
While the wheels of time
Grind my mind away
Tell me, tell me
What’s your name
