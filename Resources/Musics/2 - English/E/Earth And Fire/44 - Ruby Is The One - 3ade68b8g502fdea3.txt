RUBY IS THE ONE

Baby
I want you
Baby
I hold you
Never let you go
I’m sure that you will know

Baby
I tease you
Baby
I please you
Never let you go
You’re the first one to know

We will spend night together
We never wonder whether
We will love eachother

Oooh
Ruby
I feel you
Ruby
I love you
Hold you in my arms
So you can enjoy all my charms

Ruby is the one
Ruby ruby is the one
Ruby never knows
That Ruby Ruby was the one

Ruby is the one
Ruby ruby is the one
Ruby never knows
That Ruby Ruby was the one
