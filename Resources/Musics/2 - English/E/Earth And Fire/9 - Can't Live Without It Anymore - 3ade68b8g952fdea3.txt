CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT ANYMORE

I'm on my way
To unknown places
But I don't care at all
I try fo find my destiny
I've got to - I've got to

You're a lovely day
Full of sunshine
Like the days in June
You're the sense of a breeze
The shade from the trees
I love you - I love you

Where is your love (I can't live without it)
I would give anything in the world
To see that smile that shows so much
Of your emotion and devotion
But most of all I need your love
'cause I can't live without it anymore
