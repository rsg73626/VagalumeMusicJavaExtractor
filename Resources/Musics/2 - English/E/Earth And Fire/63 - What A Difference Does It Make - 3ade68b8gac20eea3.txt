WHAT A DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE

I got no love, no chance, no possibility
I knew I wasn’t certain
And everybody could see
That I got something to hide

What difference does it make
What difference does it make

I got no home, no friends,
no place to stay
Well I was sad and lonesome
But this is finally the day
That someone has come my way

What a difference does it make
Ooh, what a difference does it make
Oh baby, when you’re on my side
There’s love, there’s
always something there

I got no home, no friends,
no place to stay
Well I was sad and lonesome
But this is finally the day
That someone has come my way
What a difference does it make
Ooh, what a difference does it make
Oh baby, when you’re on my side
There’s love, there’s
always something there

They say you don’t know
what you’ve got in to live for
Well I know better baby
now you’re on my side
I believe it’s gonna be allright

Ooh, what a difference does it make
Ooh, what a difference does it make
Ooh, what a difference does it make
Ooh, what a difference does it make
