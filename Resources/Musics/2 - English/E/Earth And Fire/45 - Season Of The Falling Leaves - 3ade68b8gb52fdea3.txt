SEASON OF THE FALLING LEAVES

The spring has past almost seven times
You're still with me
But how can I try to keep it this way?

So hard to say everything I feel
So deep inside
I don't know why it happens
these days

I must be the season of the
falling leaves
A time that makes hearts
tend to grieve
It must be the secret of the year

Love if you leave me now
I'm supposed to find but
I don't know how
You're always - you're always
on my mind
