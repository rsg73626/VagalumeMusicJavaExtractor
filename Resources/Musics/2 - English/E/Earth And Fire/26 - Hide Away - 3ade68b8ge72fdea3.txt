HIDE AWAY

When the time has come
You find the things you have
No longer help you to get of bed
Why don't you get away

Do whatever you like
Try to be who you are
Use all your power
You've made it so far
Why don't you get away

Try to start another love affair

I don't wanna waste my time
By playing it cool
The tears that i cried
Now I know it isn't a crime
To need someone on your side
'Cause there ain't no place in the
whole wide world where
you can hide away

So I packed what I needed
Decent shoes on my feet
I left my old town
It was just a boring repeat
I'd better get away

I don't wanna waste my time
By playing it cool
The tears that i cried
Now I know it isn't a crime
To need someone on your side
'Cause there ain't no place in the
whole wide world
where you can hide away
