WISH YOU WERE HERE

Can't get a sleep tonight
I'll be tossin' and turnin'
till the early daylight
Many thoughts are crossin' my mind
I wish you were here to told me tight
This very moment I need you by my side

So baby, don't you break my heart and
Please come back to me
Without your love I'm feeling so lonely

It all just started three
weeks ago when we met
Rain all day and the streets
were totally wet
I felt so strange and
depressed I didn't know why
Maybe I needed someone to dry
the tears that I cried
Then you came passing my way
I could hardly breeth
had no words to say
You smiled at me in a special way
Making me forget that it rained all day
From that moment on
I knew you would stay

So baby, don't you break my heart and
Please come back to me
Without your love I'm feeling so lonely
When you came passing my way
I could hardly breeth
had no words to say
You smiled at me in a special way
Making me forget that it rained all day
From that moment on
I knew that you would stay

Come on and dance and have
fun with me honey
Life is free and it don't cost you money
Take a change in the game
that we're playing
Without some love it will keep on raining
