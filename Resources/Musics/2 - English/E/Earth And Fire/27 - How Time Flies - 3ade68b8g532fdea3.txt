HOW TIME FLIES

Modesty wasn't the problem
‘Cause the feeling was all around
That was the first indication
Indication we couldn’t count

Why memories are flying
on beatiful wings
High in the sky
How time flies
Isn’t it sad

Well I knew it was too late
I understood you couldn’t wait
And I came back to my only one
The words just came out very wrong
So I’ll have to say “I love you” in a song

Why memories are flying on beatiful wings
High in the sky
How time flies
I wonder why
