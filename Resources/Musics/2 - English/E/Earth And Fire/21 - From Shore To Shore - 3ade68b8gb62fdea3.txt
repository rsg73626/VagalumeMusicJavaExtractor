FROM SHORE TO SHORE

He's got a feeling he's flying
Free like a bird
He knows the world down
there is crying
But he can be hurt

But you can blame nobody
For travelling all around
This is the way he is looking for
His search will go on
More and more
From shore to shore

He's got a feeling he's wasting
His precious time on you
He's got a feeling
that his world will be shiny
When he starts a new

But you can blame nobody
For travelling all around
This is the way he is looking for
His search will go on
More and more
From shore to shore
