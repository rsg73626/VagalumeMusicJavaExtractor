SMILE

Why blame it on me
You ought to know
You ought to see
Maybe there's another kind of life
Of love, somewhere above
Wake, open your eyes
And see all those many lies
we were living in,
we were passing through
Forgetting the past,
that's what we have to do

So smile like you always do
Smile even when there's rain in you
Now I can see the sun
Now I can see what we have done
I don't feel anymore
So that's why I'm living like before
Still smile like you always do
Smile even when there's rain in you
