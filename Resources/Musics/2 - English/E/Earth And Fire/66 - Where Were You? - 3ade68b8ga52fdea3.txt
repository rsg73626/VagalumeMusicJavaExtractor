WHERE WERE YOU?

Where were you, my love
When I came home
I see you left the place
While I was gone
Couldn't you find the time to tell me
Baby it's wrong
Has it been on your mind
for who knows how long
Where were you my love
Where dit you go

Can't get you out of my mind
Though you left like a thief in the night
Can't get you out of my dreams
Farewell is so hard te believe

It's so hard to accept that I'm free
Can't get you out of my dreams
Oh baby I wish you were here
