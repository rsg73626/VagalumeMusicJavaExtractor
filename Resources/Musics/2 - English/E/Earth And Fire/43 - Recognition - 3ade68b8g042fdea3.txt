RECOGNITION

Can you feel the wind
Your hair is dancing
And your driftin' away
Away to the sun declining
in the afternoon
Where the dreamer is waiting for the moon
Away where patient
chronos shows his smile
T ill he turns on your mind
T here will be no direction
Safely left behind
For what's beyond
expression is so hard to find Nobody knows
This place of mine
The nights sad and long
After that time

I remember forever
From that very first time
What keeps us together
What's bringing us here
I believe in you
Ooh I just wanted you

The sound of your voice
Sad searching young man
Made me sure of my choice
Every time I hear it again

While Pharao is watching
I'm following my guide
Swallowed by the crowd
I try to keep you in sight
