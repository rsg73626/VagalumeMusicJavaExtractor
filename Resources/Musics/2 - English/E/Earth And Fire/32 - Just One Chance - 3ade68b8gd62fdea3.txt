JUST ONE CHANCE

Give me a chance to explain
what's going on
D eep in my heart
I know it ain't wrong
I'll follow you,
where you're going to
Maybe one day my dream
will come true
Wrong or right,
you're gonna spend the night
With someone else but
Why it ain't me
Is it so hard to see
I am longing for you
Turn around,
let your love shine on me
Will it ever be
Instead of friends lovers in the end
I shall bide my time with a smile
Until you turn around and finally see
