A LIFE-TIME BEFORE

Now that we have met
I looked at your face
Behind your blue eyes
There's a timeless space

Don't know why you ignore me
And I regret that you won't see me
There's no solution
The only conclusion
But my feelings tell me more
About a life-time before

Now that you've left
I remain here alone
The emptiness there is
I hope to know you again

Don't know why you ignore me
And I regret that you won't see me
There's no solution
The only conclusion
But my feelings tell me more
About a life-time before
