DRIFTIN'

Can you feel the wind
Your hair is dancing
And your driftin' away
Away to the sun declining
in the afternoon
Where the dreamer is waiting for the moon
Away where patient
chronos shows his smile
T ill he turns on your mind
T here will be no direction
Safely left behind
For what's beyond
expression is so hard to find
