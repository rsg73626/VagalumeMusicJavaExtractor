WILD AND EXCITING

What is it you try to say
Is it something you don’t know
Is it something you won’t know
You’re acting well when you tell
The problems that break you
If you don’t it’s a hell
You got to know what you’re gonna do

Play your game the other way
You got to please her and hold her tight
You must be with her day and night
You’ll be surprised the way she walks
Surprised the way she talks
And when you look into her eyes
You soon will realise

Manta, she’s wild and exciting
Manta, she’s wild and exciting
