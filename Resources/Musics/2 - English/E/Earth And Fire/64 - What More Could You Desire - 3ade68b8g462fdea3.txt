WHAT MORE COULD YOU DESIRE

Why don't you stop (stop) fooling yourself
Don't you see your dream has gone
Make up your mind
As soon as you can
Stand up
Show me who you really are
Who you really are

What more could you desire
After all that you've seen
A life without temptation
It's not so senseless as it seems

I'm waiting for the day
I'll be free of fear
Of losing verything I've never had
Back to myself again
Following nature's plan
Realise that's all
No reason to fall
We've got it all

What more could you desire
After all that you've seen
A life without temptation
It's not so senseless as it seems

So there you are
Crossing my way
You're so far
But coming closer
I'm fighting temptation
Please stay
It's not a game I will play
I need you to find my way

What more (you've got it all)
could you desire
