WALLS OF JERICHO

Though you're talking of love,
I feel an army of silence around you
As if your heart's under siege
And a million questions
hardly surround you

Will you come tumbling down
Like the walls of Jericho

Even if it's a dream
Don't break the spell by
these words of confusion
when the morning has come
You've gone away,
your love only illusion

Will you come tumbling down
Like the walls of Jericho
Seven times seven
Circles of love
Will you go around

In between days
The parting of ways
There's a cascading
stream of desire
Feeling our hearts overflowing
Nothing's gonna stop love
from growing
Again
