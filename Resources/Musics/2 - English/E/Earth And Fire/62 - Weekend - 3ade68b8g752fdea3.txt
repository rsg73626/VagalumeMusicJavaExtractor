WEEKEND

Sunday and it’s so hard
to say goodbye
I don’t know what to do
Passing the days without you
Friday night when I see you again
You’ll make a fool out of me
I don’t wanna be your
lover for the weekend

Sometimes when I’m looking
at your face
There’s something in your eyes
that makes me realize
We’ve got no chance if we’re
going on this way
You mean such a lot to me
I don’t wanna be your
lover for the weekend

Love in a woman’s heart
I wanna have the whole
and not a part
It’s strange that this feeling
grows more and more
‘Cause I’ve never loved
someone like you before
