FANFARE

At two o'clock they had a date
Preparation for performance at eight
Nineteen instruments
Polished and bright

Unfortunately their final
concert is tonight
The brassband dressed
in blue and white
So little audience
around the bandstand

The conductor lifts up his hand
Trumpets, tubas,
trombones resound
But frow fader the sloser
A bigger band comes
which musicians play so loud and pure

Tunes of trumpets, tubas,
trombones resound
But grow fader the closer
A bigger band comes
which musicians play so loud and so pure
Nineteen man packed up their instruments
