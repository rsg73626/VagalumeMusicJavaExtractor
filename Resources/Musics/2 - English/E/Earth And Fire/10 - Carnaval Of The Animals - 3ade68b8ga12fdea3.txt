CARNAVAL OF THE ANIMALS

The leaves and the trees
are telling you
There's a party in the forest
And then the rabbit
pricus up it's ears
The squirrel jumps on the ground
Hey, Mr Frog are comin'soon
The cortege is just leavin
'Please not to fast
cries the turtle pair
We wouldn't be left behind

Starled birds above
the trees, the trees
The hind with the hare,
the swine with the snake

Jigging with eachother
Yellow flowers all around
They are smiling gently smiling
Hey it's spring, laugh and sing
sings the animal choir
woodpeckers, crickets,
nightingales

You should have heard their music
From cloud to cloud birds
flatterin' away, away
