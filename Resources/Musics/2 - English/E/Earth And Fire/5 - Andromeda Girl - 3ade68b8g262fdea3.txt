ANDROMEDA GIRL

Another daybreak just begun
This very moment I start to realise
You're leaving home of man
No words can tell what I read
in your eyes

Another hour we're together
Maybe ever, maybe never
No returning, feelings burning
deep inside my heart

Memories will take your place
when you float around in space
Love has to show how far we can go

This morning you were still around
Now my heart is on the ground
Some years ago a far-out plan
From dream to scheme,
you're leaving home of man

Zero hour getting closer
Engines burning, no returning
Maybe ever, maybe never
A journey in reverse

Time will fade away in space
For the sake of the human race
Love has to show how far we can go

The start was good, the fight was bad
A lot of chips which have gone dead
So many stars that we have passed
My friends havo gone and 'm depressed

Two million light-years from the earth
Near the andromeda there was
nothing to be heard
Empty space, nothing more to see
We sure are heading for another galaxy
The sea of silence changed into a whirl
The whispering voice of the
Andromeda girl
Only time knows why

What's the use of this Odyssey
Is it all to find eternity
Is's destiny couldn't be explained
Could his efforts be in vain
Would he go into the blind
For the sake of progress of all mankind
He has finally reached the ultimate line
All the answers are hidden in time

Welcome, welcome to
my world of spheres
And don't slip away into useless fears
O always knew that you
would finally come
I am glad that I've waited that long
The knowledge you were looking for
is just behind my astral door

The universal love for you
is eternal existence for us two
it's the only change if the time is right
I'll always be your cosmic bride
Only time knows why

What's the use of this Odyssey
Is it all to find eternity
Is's destiny couldn't be explained

Could his efforts be in vain
Would he go into the blind
For the sake of progress of all mankind
He has finally reached the ultimate line
All the answers are hidden in time

Well now you are back home again
I knew you'de come but
I didn't know when
I thought it would really do you good
to land among this brotherhood
Only time knows why

The world that you've left behind
sometimes disturbs your peace of mind
You want the world to know
how a perfect world would grow

I understand all that you say
but a perfect world is far away
Oh darling don't you see
that they make a fool out of you and me

No understanding, acting so cool
how can we ever trust a fool
He's a fool

Will you ever understand him
Maybe ever, maybe never
Will you ever understand him
Maybe ever, maybe never

No understanding, acting so cool
How can we ever trust a fool
He's a fool
