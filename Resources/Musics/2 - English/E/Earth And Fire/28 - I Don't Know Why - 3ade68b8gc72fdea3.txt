I DON'T KNOW WHY

I don't know why you're going to leave
I hear you tellin' how you need to be free
But there will be a time
that you need my hand
A new beginnin' or is this the end?

Though you believe in whatever may lie
In those things only money can buy

I was happy with a man like you
And I hardly believe that it's true
And told me twice you needed to be free
Was it so hard to share it with me?

Don't you pretend that you'll soon be gone
in the end we all stand alone

Pretty baby so you wanna be free
Pretty baby then you don't need me
So come on baby pack your things and go
Come on baby, don't put on a show

I was happy with a man like you
And I hardly believe that it's true
You told me twice, you needed to be free
Was it so hard to share it with me?

Though you believe in whatever may lie
in those things only money can buy
Don't you prentend that you'll soon be gone
in the end we all stand alone

Pretty baby so you wanna be free
Pretty baby then you don't need me
So come on baby pack your things and go
Come on baby, don't put on a show
