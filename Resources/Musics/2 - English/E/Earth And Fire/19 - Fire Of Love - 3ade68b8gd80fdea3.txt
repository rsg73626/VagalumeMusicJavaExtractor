FIRE OF LOVE

The spring in the air
Makes me so aware
Of feelings i'm missing
Looking at the past
The love that didn't last
Gladness in the pain
Sunshine in the rain

Fire of love - how many tears
Fire of love - how many years

I still remember the moments with you
Now it seems so near
So hard to forget
The good times I had
You were my heart's desire
I had to stop you callin'
Leave it all - face the world
and make a new beginning

Fire of love - so many tears
Fire of love - really sincere
Fire of love - I hold you dear

The season of the year
Gives me such a cheer
Of huggin' and kissin
'Just the other day
A nes love came my way
And set my heart on fire
Feel this moment for an ever lasting love
A lifetime without tears
That's what I want

Fire of love - how many years
Fire of love - really sincere
Fire of love - so many tears
Fire of love - I hold you dear
