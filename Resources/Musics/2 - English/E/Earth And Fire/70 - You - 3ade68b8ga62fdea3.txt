YOU

You and me we've always
lived in harmony
I wonder why it has to be
It's like it only happens to me
A paradise you really took
me by surprise
The world we lived in once, so nice
Seemed you'd only told me lies

What went wrong,
that once started so strong
It's that same old song
'bout a woman in love

Still you, you made me feel
that I was real
Why did you go,
your absence is hurting me so

Baby come back I want your love
Please don't leave me alone
I'll wait for you till you've
changed your mind
And see that I need you so

'Cause I've been true to you
And that's one thing
I can't say about you

You and me we've always
lived in harmony
I wonder why it has to be
It's like it only happens to me
A paradise you really took
me by surprise
The world we lived in once, so nice
Seemed you'd only told me lies

What went wrong,
that once started so strong
It's that same old song
'bout a woman in love

Still you, you made me feel
that I was real
Why did you go,
your absence is hurting me so

Baby come back I want your love
Please don't leave me alone
I'll wait for you till you've
changed your mind
And see that I need you so
