LOVE PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR

See the flowers in the distance
between the cold grey stones
Facing the white mountain slopes
of chappel in the vally

Love, please close the door

A cold wind moans
and chases the clouds
Carrying along their snow
But you closed the door
Ther's a fire burning for us
to keep us warm and safe for tonight

Hear the sounds and melodies
of rilets flowing down
They're the verlasting songs
whispering all the time
As a warning that behind some rocks
there's a rigid grap even
oreads fear the tread
