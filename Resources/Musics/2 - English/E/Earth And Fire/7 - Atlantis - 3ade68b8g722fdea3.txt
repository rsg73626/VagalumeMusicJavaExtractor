ATLANTIS

A. Prelude (instrumentaal)
B. Prologue (don't know)

Don't know where they're going
Don't know why it's happening
Don't know why they're moving
in this migration so endlessly
Don't know where they're going
They don't know
I'm feeling the sorrows
Feeling their fears
Feeling their desperation
that grows so endlessly
Feeling their sorrow
I'm feeling

History has proved
Evil leads to tragedy
and complete disharmony
They had to leave their familiar world
to preserve it's reminisecence
for future generations

They don't know where they're going
Don't know what's happening
Don't know why they're moving
in this migration so endlessly
I'm feeling their sorrows
Feeling their desperation
that grows so endlessly
Feeling their sorrow
They don't know

C. The Rise And Fall (under a cloudy sky)

Under a cloudy sky
in the centre of the city
The seven temples rose up amazing high
Reflecting superiority in a famous past

People on 'Sunsquare'
are lounging in the marketplace
Where merchants sound the praises
of their wares
Urging on their slaves to hurry on

Somewhere in the air
without making any sound
Vimanas floating to the
harbour of their land
Which piloting magicians only knew

All their neighbourlands
They were the victims of their eagerness
For getting a lot of gold and more slaves
confronted with battles and cruelty

While time is going by
Among those tyrants
Disharmony is growing to an
irrepable break
Caused by desire for power and luxury

An island unwilling
to obey predicted laws
By those tyrants was condemned
to disappear
Forces of nature were misused

D. Theme of Atlantis (instrumentaal)
E. The treat (suddenly)

Suddenly from the city you see
Glowing clouds of ash
as a sign that today
An island has been destroyed

Suddenly people gather on 'Sunsquare'
Silent afraid and confused
Because tjey have so much to lose
They wonder why

Suddenly from the city you see
Glowing clouds of ash
as a sign that today
An island has been destroyed

Suddenly wrapped in a bright
white aureole
Already knowing thier fate
The wizards appear in the gate
There's evil here
Our land is condemned to die

F. Destruction (Rumbling from inside the Earth)

Rumblin' from inside the earth
in frightening kings as well as slaves
In front of their panic eyes
Their world is fallin' down
The foundations of their temples shake
Earthquakes punish their pride

Rumblin' from inside the earth
Announcing eruption
Volcanoes spit their fire
Their vomit crawls down
and embraces the structures
that have remained
Hell fire punish their pride

Rumblin' from inside the earth
is drowned by howling of the wind
unchained by abuse of knowledge
Wind disperse poison-gas
The whirl winds ravage north,
south east and west
Scoring air punish their pride

Rumblin' from inside the earth
increasing to a final stage
Neither king nor slave survives
and then the ocean waves
Take possession of the sinking land
Wild waters punish their pride

G. Epilogue (don't know)

Don't know where they're going
They don't know
The people of this migration
will live together in a land
Where the sunshine awakes
Forming part of the eternal
undulation of the human race
An undolation forever
Forever!
