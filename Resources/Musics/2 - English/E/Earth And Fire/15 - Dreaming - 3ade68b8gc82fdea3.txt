DREAMING

At the end of the day
The oceanwind is cold
Imagine the clouds in hues
of blue and gold
He has seen this all before
But always returned to the shore

He watches the tide,
the waves come rolling in
Picks up a shell,
the sand sticks to his skin
In the red of the evening sun
The memories mingle with fun

He's dreaming, dreaming, high in the sky
He's flying, flying so far and so high

At the end of the day
emotions fill his heart
As always goodbye
is tearing him apart
As the ocean in endless flow
He likes to be free and let go

Have no more illusions
lure into the dark
Let go and be free,
and love will light a spark
No clinging to the past
And freedom will be there at last
No clinging to the past
And freedom will be there at last
