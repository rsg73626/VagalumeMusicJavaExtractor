LOVE IS AN OCEAN

Loving you was all I ever had
And i know I'll never forget
Holding you, loving each other
I thought our love
never would come to an end
But how can it be
That I never see you again

Love is an ocean, always in motion
Endless and ever so deep
Love always grows like a river that flows
Making its way to the sea

Losing you wasn't in vain
'Cause you really tried to drive me insane
Took some time to get it right
There's more love in the world
than just for you and I
So baby we're through
I'm gonna find someone new

Oh sweet rendez-vous
How I long for you
So please don't come late
I hardly can wait
I'm blue no longer
Coming over to you
Babe, I'll get to know you better
Every time I'll see you again

Love is an ocean, always in motion
Endless and ever so deep
Love always grows like a river that flows
Making its way to the sea

Sweet rendez-vous
How I long for you
So please don't come late
I hardly can wait
I'm blue no longer
Coming over to you
Babe, I'll get to know you better
Every time I'll see you again

Love is an ocean, always in motion
Endless and ever so deep
Love always grows like a river that flows
Making its way to the sea
