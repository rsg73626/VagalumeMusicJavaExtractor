LOVE QUIVER

When you’ve got to choose
You wonder: I should have
know better, better, better

When you’ve got to lose
You want to leave life
forever, ever

When you’re realy down
on the ground
And beneath your smile
you wear a frown
While the rain is falling down
from the sky
You see a little girl cry

While you watch the rain
You think of times
together, gether, gether
And in your window-pane
Reflections of her just
gather, gather

You don’t have to feel
sorry my friend
It is just the loosing end
While the rain is falling down
from the sky
You see a little girl cry

Did you, did you, did you see her,
she cries herself a river
You have just lost your last
arrow of your love quiver

When you’ve got to choose
You wonder: I should have
know better, better, better

When you’ve got to lose
You want to leave life
forever, ever

When you’re realy down
on the ground
And beneath your smile
you wear a frown
While the rain is falling down
from the sky
You see a little girl cry

Did you, did you, did you see her,
she cries herself a river
You have just lost your last
arrow of your love quiver
