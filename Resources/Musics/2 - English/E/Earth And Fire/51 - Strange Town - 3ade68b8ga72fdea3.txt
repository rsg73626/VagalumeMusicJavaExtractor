STRANGE TOWN

It was a strange town and
a strange street
Nothing really looked familiar to me
I never was so far from home
I never felt so alone

I don't even know your name
Still tonight please make me stay
Till the mornin' calls the sun
And i'll be on my way

Rock and roll and one night-stands
Stamp your feet and clap your hands
The crowd is lookin' up to me
But your smilin' face I never see

No one even knows what it's like
To sing of love when
your heart is on strike
'Till the mornin' calls the sun
Don't feel so bad 'bout a
one-night stand
Love began and my heartache will end
Wish to find you I have to go
And sing this song on the radio

It was a strange town
and a strange street
Nothing really looked familiar to me
Rock and roll and one night-stands
Stamp your feet and clap your hands

No one even knows what it's like
To sing of love when
your heart is on strike
'Till the mornin' calls the sun
Don't feel so bad 'bout a
one-night stand
Love began and my heartache will end
W ish to find you I have to go
And sing this song on the radio
