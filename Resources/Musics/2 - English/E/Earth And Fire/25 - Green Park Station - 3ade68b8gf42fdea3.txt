GREEN PARK STATION

Hey love
Why did you leave me
Where did I go wrong
Got a feelin'
You're not sure of
our love should be strong
The only thing that I can say
Buy a ticket and take a train

Green park station where we meet again
Going down town
we will be lovers by then
We gonna dance tonight
till morning light
I am sure it's gonna be allright

Hey love
What are you up to
Gotta make up your mind
Tell me
What can I do
to help you decide
The only thing that I can say
Buy a ticket and take a train

Green park station where we meet again
Going down town
We will be lovers by then
We gonna dance tonight
Till morning light
I am sure it's gonna be allright
