VIVID SHADY LAND

The leaves are smashed
on the riverside
The trees are burning and
they’re crying bright
A pale face waves through
the chasing clouds
Like a drunkard who is just
blacking out

Where is this place,
this vivid shady land
Where young lovers go
and walk hand in hand
There we will be in our
fate of being blind
And there we will dance
and make love with our mind
Oh vivid shady land

The leaves have landed on
the riverwaves
The trees are staring like
crosses on their graves
The pale face is wasted,
there’s a glorious sun
The drunkard is sleeping,
a new day is born

Why, tell me why must this
come to and end?
Where is the keeper of the
key to this land?
We’re ready to pay for the
dews of this sight
So we sure will pay before
we die inside
Oh vivid shady land

The leaves are smashed
on the riverside
The trees are burning and
they’re crying bright
A pale face waves through
the chasing clouds
Like a drunkard who is just
blacking out

Where is this place,
this vivid shady land
Where young lovers go
and walk hand in hand
There we will be in our
fate of being blind
And there we will dance
and make love with our mind
Oh vivid shady land
