LOVE IS TO GIVE AWAY

How do I, how do I get to you baby
How do I, How do I get to you?
Don't say no and don't say maybe
What you say just can't be true
Gimme that, gimme that lovin' I'm feelin'
Gimme that, gimme that love I feel

Sometimes it's hard to say
What you feel comes out in a funny way
You tell me you wanna be free
But you still come runnin' to me

Sometimes it's hard to tell
in spite of all I'm under your spell

Sundays you like to stay
But mondays you are on your way

Love is to give away
Why don't you send it my way

Someday I will come to you
Things I feel just have to be true
As soon as you will try to see
You can stay with me and still be free

Love is to give away
Why don't you you send some my way

How do I, how do I get to you baby
How do I, How do I get to you?
Don't say no and don't say maybe
What you say just can't be true
Gimme that, gimme that lovin' I'm feelin'
Gimme that, gimme that love I feel
