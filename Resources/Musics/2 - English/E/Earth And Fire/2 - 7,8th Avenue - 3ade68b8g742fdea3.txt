7,8TH AVENUE

Life started with you
seven-eight avenue
The sun was just comin' through
and brightened the morning dew
When will you ever return again?

Don't let me down
'Cause I'm sure, the summer
will make us feel like new
it's the only change that we can get together
Just me and you
On seven-eight avenue
On seven-eight avenue
On seven-eight avenue

Love took us away
every summernight
The chacing crazy world of today
was getting out of sight
When will you ever return again?
