INVITATION

y dream told me
Go and look
For the girl in the sand
Near the hill far away

She will appear
When the sunshine awakes
And the morningdew
Spreads over the day

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
Got this feeling tonight
I’ve had an invitation

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
I feel so good
I’ve got an invitation

She forces him
To come closer to her
But she fades away
While she’s calling his name

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
I feel so good
I’ve got an invitation

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
Got this feeling tonight
I’ve had an invitation

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
I feel so good
I’ve got an invitation

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
Got this feeling tonight
I’ve had an invitation

Yes I’m walking down to my lady
I feel so good
I’ve got an invitation
