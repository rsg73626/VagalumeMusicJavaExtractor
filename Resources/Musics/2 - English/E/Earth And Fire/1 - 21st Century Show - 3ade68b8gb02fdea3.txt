21ST CENTURY SHOW

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Twenty-first century show

Marching and moaning and crying
and dying in no time
Like home-lost pigeons
and full of suspicions in their mind
Let us go to the merry-go-round
Come on now let them go
It’s the twenty-first century show
Nothing there they really need

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Twenty-first century

Neuro-surgeons are dreaming
of more and more
They’re begging and begging
'oh please' at your door
Let us go to the merry-go-round
Observations of a fool
It’s the twentieth centuries’ fool
But he stays really cool

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Twenty-first century

Our technical friend can be
a deadly friend in the end
Will wisdom survive this
technical friend
your friend
Let us go to the merry-go-round
Come on to the sun
I’m glad there is one
Let it shine
Let it shine
