STREETS OF SHAME

Don't make a sound, just steal away
Into the darkness of night
No one will catch you this time
Here in the heartland of organized crime
No law can convict you
It's clear you can't even stand trial

Look at you now, you're just a kid
The syndicate's newest tool
Don't be fooled by that innocent look
Mushillo you've learned every
trick in the book
You deal in illusions
And keep on supplying the goods
On the streets of shame

Trapped in a world of treachery
Hooked on this way of life
By now you no longer feel pain
Selling your soul in the blistering rain
The way to survive
Is by playing this dangeroes game
On the streets of shame
Streets of shame
