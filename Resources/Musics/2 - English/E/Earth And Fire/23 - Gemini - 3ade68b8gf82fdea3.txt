GEMINI

Why did you leave on the spur
of the moment
Without so much as a word of goodbye
Deep down I've known all along
That you never intended to stay
Being too restless at heart
When autumn came you went away

I wish I could say that I don't
really need you
That we were like ships
that passed in the night
Have I taken attraction for love
In my eagerness to have you near
Say you just need some time to yourself
When summer comes, I'll be waiting here

Gemini, I gave you my heart
Did what you want me to
I could have told you right from the start
There's no getting over you

Oh Gemini, don't leave me no more
No matter what I do
You know I want you like never before
No there's no getting over you

I'd like to believe it's a match
made in heaven
If I ask you no questions you
tell me no lies
By now I got used to the fact
That you're constantly changing
your ways
And the thought of you coming back
Helps me through these cold
winterdays
