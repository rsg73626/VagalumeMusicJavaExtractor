YOU KNOW THE WAY

You know the way you look at life
And you know the way
you got to hide from danger
You know how to realize your words
That everybody heard
It’s good to see the way you look at life
My friend, my friend
You don’t know how to kiss me
And you don’t know how to hold my hand
And still don’t understand
It’s bad to see the way you treat me

You know the way you look at life
And you know the way
you got to hide from danger
You know how to realize your words
That everybody heard
It’s good to see the way you look at life
My friend, my friend
You don’t know how to kiss me
And you don’t know how to hold my hand
And still don’t understand
It’s bad to see the way you treat me
