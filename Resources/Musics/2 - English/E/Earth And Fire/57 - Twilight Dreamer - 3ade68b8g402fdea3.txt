TWILIGHT DREAMER

A sun-tanned shady person
is wandering along the shore
I think it’s the twilight dreamer
who probably knows more
The old bearded man is
now watching the twilight time
A seagull is floating above
the sea and gets a fish in time

Thousands of faces,
they’re laughing at him

The crimson ball is gently
falling without making a noise
The only sounds he hears
are the thousands faces’ voice
Hear them say: they show us the way

There comes Lydia
Lydia’s waltzing
Dancing Lydia in the crimson ball

He longs to his young drowned
Lydia who died in a terrible way
The thousand faces are laughing,
they’ll never tell him the way
The tears are burning in his
eyes and they’re dropping in his beard
They’re twinkling in the twilight time
He himself feels quite weird

The crimson ball, he’s drowning now

There comes Lydia
Lydia’s waltzing
Dancing Lydia in the crimson ball

There comes Lydia
Lydia’s waltzing
Dying Lydia in the crimson ball

The ceremony is over, the crimson
ball has gone
The twilight dreamer is tired and
is also moving on
The crimson ball,
he’s gone away now
