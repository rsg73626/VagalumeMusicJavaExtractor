FROM THE END TILL THE BEGINNING

My existence was between
God and mountains
Where will I be?
Solar systems

They’re growing very fast
A last farewell to removing Gods
The scorched earth is dying
My existence was between

God and mountains
They’re turning into dust
To return after many ages
The scorched earth is dying
