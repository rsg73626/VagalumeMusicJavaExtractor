DREAM

The day you came into my life
You talked about man and wife
The words I hear will never disappear
You, you make it shining bright
Even when the day turns into night

I heard your thoughts one by one
And now we watch the morning sun
The words I hear will never disappear
You, you make it shining bright
Even when the day turns into night

It's all like a dream
Oh my love
I couldn't sleep
I love to be again in your fair company
A never-ending dream
Oh my love
You changed the nightmare in the night
Into a garden of delight
Of one thing I'm sure
It's you I am living for

I heard your thoughts one by one
And now we watch the morning sun
The words I hear will never disappear
You, you make it shining bright
Even when the day turns into night

It's all like a dream
Oh my love
I couldn't sleep
I love to be again in your fair company
A never-ending dream
Oh my love
You changed the nightmare in the night
Into a garden of delight
Of one thing I'm sure
It's you I am living for
