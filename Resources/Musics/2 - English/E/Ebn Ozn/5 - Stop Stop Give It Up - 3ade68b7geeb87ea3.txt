STOP STOP GIVE IT UP

When your favorite tangerine dream has long died
Lucy dropped the diamond
You're uncertain and your spirit just whispers inside
Look behind the curtain
Chorus:
Stop, stop, give it up
Stop, stop, give it up
Give it up
Stop, stop, give it up
Stop, stop, give it up
Give it up
When the fear has turned our your love till it's dark
Breathe the golden light in
And you'll fly to Strawberry Fields, Central Park
The Holy Man's been writing
repeat chorus
There are colors that none of us ever have seen
The '70's' are over
Now its time for infinite shades of green
Better move over, rover
repeat chorus
Om, om, om...
