I WANT CASH

I want cash
Hey yay ee yay yo
Hey yay ee yay yo
I want cash
I want cash
I need cash for the groceries
Money for the lights
I'm overdue in rent two months
Now that ain't right
I've got a part time job
I need a full-time situation
I'm in the market for some real remuneration
Interest rates
Business slumps
Income tax
All bust my hump
Want cash, green cash, real cash
Gimmee ga-gimmee some dollars
Hard cash, cold cash, real cash
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee some cash
Need cash, love cash
Hey yay ee yay yo
Hey yay ee yay yo
I've been on the dole
Yea! I've stood on that line
Security's a mystery in these hard times
I've been on Broadway one year
And a busboy the next
My ego's been so battered
That my head is a wreck
But I persevere forward
Though I struggle to survive
A cautious optimistic fool
I've still got my pride
Want cash, green cash, real cash
Gimmee ga-gimmee some quotations
Hard cash, cold cash, it's cash
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee some cash
Need cash, love cash
I need cash for my hard work
Money on the line
You've got to treat me right
If you want my time
They've got a big hunk here
They've got a little piece there
Lawyer, agent, record company
Got their share
Well if I can't make a living
At my God-given place
I'll just cut off my nose
And spite my face
Hey yay ee yo
Want cash, green cash, cold cash
Gimmee ga-gimmee some lira
Not trash, hard cash, need cash
Love cash
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee some
Quatioons, yen, ruples, pesos
Dollars Ahaa Ahaa
Marvin...Oh Marvin
