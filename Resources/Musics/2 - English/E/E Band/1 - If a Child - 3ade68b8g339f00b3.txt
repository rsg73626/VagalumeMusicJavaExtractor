IF A CHILD

If a child lives with criticism 
He learns to condemn 
If a child lives with shame 
He learns to feel guilty 

If a child lives with forgiveness 
He learns to have patience 
If a child lives with fairness 
He learns justice 

If a child lives with security 
He learns to have faith 

There's a love He will give you 
You can't conceive it, just believe it 
But you must become as a child 
To receive it 

Open up - He will come into your heart 
Then you will see it 
If a child lives with Jesus 
He learns to give love to the world
