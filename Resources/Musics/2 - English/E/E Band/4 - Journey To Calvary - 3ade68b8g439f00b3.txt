JOURNEY TO CALVARY

For years we've searched to find the Son 
We've heard he's here, is our search done 
Although we've traveled many roads 

We have not found our King 
You say this man upon that cross 
Might be the One we seek 

We heard him cry, "Eli, Eli, 
My God, why do You forsake me?" 
He cried again in agony 
He died before our eyes 
But now the ground it seems to shake 
And darkness fills the sky 

The crowd has fled, the veil is torn 
And now all nature seems to mourn 
The earthquake and these things we've seen 
Have filled our hearts with grief 
Could this man you've crucified 
Be God's Son indeed? 

The crowd has fled, the veil is torn 
And now all nature seems to mourn 

Oh, my sweet Lord! 
He cried again in agony 
He died before our eyes, yes 
But now the ground it seems to shake 
And darkness fills the sky 
We heard Him cry, "Eli, Eli, 
My God, why do You forsake me?"
