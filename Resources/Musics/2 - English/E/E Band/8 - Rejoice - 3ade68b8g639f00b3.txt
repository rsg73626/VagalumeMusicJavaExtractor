REJOICE

Wake up, wake up, it's the break of day 
Light is shining showing you the way 
Da-da-da 
Wake up to what Jesus has to say 

All your life you searched to find the truth 
Try to realize He's come for you 
Da-da-da 
Don't you realize He's come for you 

Wake up, little children and forsake your games 
Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake 
For you he has paid the price 
For you he was sacrificed 
Rejoice, rejoice 

Wake up, oh sleeping soul, your father calls 
For you can be reborn, washed clean and made new 
God's love can change your life 
By faith in Jesus Christ 
Rejoice, rejoice 

Wake up, restless one, fall on your knees 
For God has come to earth to make us free 
He died that men might live 
He rose new life to give 
Rejoice, rejoice 

Rejoice - we're all one 
Rejoice - we're underneath the Son 
Rejoice - there's nowhere to run 
Rejoice - and it's only just begun 
Rejoice - I said we're all one 
Rejoice - we're underneath God's Son 
Rejoice - the Holy Ghost has come 
Rejoice - and it's only just begun
