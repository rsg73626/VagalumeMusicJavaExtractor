OCTOBER 9TH

I think you are the best that a soul could have
I think you are the best a girl a boy could have
I wish I could grow up to be someone like you
I wish that you could see

This house feels so empty without you being here
But I can feel you inside,
You will always be with me, forever, for as long as I live
I wanna change the world like you did

This is not another goodbye song,
It's a thank you for open my heart,
Love song
I wanna change the world like you did.
This is not another goodbye song,
It's a thank you for open my heart,
Love song
I wanna change the world like you did.

There's nothing left you hope for

This is going out to the broken heart
This house feel so empty
Without you being here
This is going out to the broken heart
This house feel so empty
Without you being here

This is not another goodbye song,
It's a thank you for open my heart,
Love song
I wanna change the world like you did.
This is not another goodbye song,
It's a thank you for open my heart,
Love song
I wanna change the world like you did.

There's nothing left you hope for
