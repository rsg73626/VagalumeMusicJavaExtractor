FOREVER IN A DAY

if only the wind could take away these feelings
why did you leave and take my life with you
Your last words are stuck inside my mind
and I'm left here with nothing but pain

Take me, abuse me, refuse me
I will stay, I won't run away
Take me, abuse me, refuse me
I will stay, Forever in this day

Why do my words no longer mean the same
why can't my tears be kissed by you again
you promissed that you would always stay right here
but you lied and it's only me now

Take me, abuse me, refuse me
I will stay, I wont run away
Take me, abuse me, refuse me
I will stay, surprised
For the rest of... 
For the rest of my life...

this place, has your face
The wind sounds, like your voice
this sun, has the shine
of your beautiful blue eyes
If only I could bring the shine again
if only I...
I wish I was someone ohh...
so I, could be with you

Take me, abuse me, refuse me
I will stay, I wont run away
Take me, abuse me, refuse me
I will stay... forever in this day (stay)
forever in this day (stay)
forever in this.... day
