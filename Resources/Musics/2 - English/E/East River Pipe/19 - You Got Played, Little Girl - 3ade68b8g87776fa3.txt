YOU GOT PLAYED, LITTLE GIRL

You're gonna wake up someday soon.
You're gonna fly right out that window.
You're gonna see how you've been tricked.
You're gonna smell which way the wind blows.

You got played, my little girl, my girl.
You got played, my little girl, my girl.

I should have married you last year, last year,
Cuz now you're waitin' 'round for nothing.
Your father walks right through his ruse,
He knew I never was just bluffing.

You got played, my little girl, my girl.
You got played, my little girl, my girl.
