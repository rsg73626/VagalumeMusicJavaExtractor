ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

What's in my head? what's in my head? nothing.
What's in my head? what's in my head? nothing.
Oh, it's nothing. absolutely nothing.
Could've been something. it's absolutely nothing.
No no
Nothing. absolutely nothing. nothing. absolutely nothing.
Nothing. absolutely nothing. nothing. absolutely nothing.
Oh
