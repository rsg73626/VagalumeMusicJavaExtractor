SHINY, SHINY PIMPMOBILE

Shiny, shiny pimpmobile
Running through the night
Shiny, shiny pimpmobile
Running through the night

We're all alone, just get inside
We're going for a little ride
The cherry bombs, confederate flags
Don't forget that's all you are.

Shiny, shiny pimpmobile
Running through the night
Shiny, shiny pimpmobile
Running through the night.
