MAKE A DEAL WITH THE CITY

You live in this city
make a deal with the city now
you live in this city
make a deal with the city right now

sometimes just blow up
sometimes just deflate
sometimes just hang on
sometimes pull the weight

you live in this city
make a deal with the city now
you live in this city
make a deal with the city right now

'cause people disappear
and life might be a joke
you're getting smaller everyday
you're like a plane flying over me
waving bye-bye
sing
no bye-byes
no bye-byes
no bye-byes

gotta fly away from you
gotta fly away from you.
