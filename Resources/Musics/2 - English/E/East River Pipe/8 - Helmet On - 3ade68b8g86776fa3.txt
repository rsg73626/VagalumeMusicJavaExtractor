HELMET ON

Well he wondered what
his life would be like
with the prettiest boy in town
on a rainy tuesday morning
so he put his helmet on
he put his helmet on
he put his helmet on

well he wondered what
his life would be like
with the prettiest boy in town
with the perfect hair
and the perfect skin
so he put his helmet on
he put his helmet on
he put his helmet on

put the helmet on
put the helmet on
oh no

well he wondered what
his life would be like
on a rainy tuesday morning
seven years down the road
so he took the 1 to christopher
walked past the boots and saddle
saw a guy in the window
with a crewcut staring back
he said

put the helmet on
put the helmet on
oh no.
