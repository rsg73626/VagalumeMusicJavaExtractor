MY LIFE IS WRONG

God knows i've tried to live
but this is all there is
the power to forgive
is all that we can hope for now

you were a meteor
you were a dinosaur
you were the two by four
that cracked me in my head last night

let me wake up right
let me wake up right
'cause i know my life is wrong
i know my life is wrong
you told me so

daddy, daddy please don't go.
