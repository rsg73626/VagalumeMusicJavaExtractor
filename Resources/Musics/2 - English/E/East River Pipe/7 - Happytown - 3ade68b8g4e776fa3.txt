HAPPYTOWN

We're going down
to happytown
we never talked
the way we feel 'til now

got a view of the station
and teh side of the colgate clock
got money downstairs
but you're still jumping off the docks

we're going down
to happytown
we never talked
the way we feel 'til now

can't you feel your life is burning underground
can't you feel your life is burning underground now

we're going down
to happytown
we never said anything 'til now
can't you feel your life is burning underground
can't you feel your life is burning underground now
can't you feel your life
feel your life
feel your life
feel your life
feel it
feel it.
