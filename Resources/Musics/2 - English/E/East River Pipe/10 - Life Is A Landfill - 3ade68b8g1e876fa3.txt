LIFE IS A LANDFILL

Life is a landfill, baby
all this garbage piled high
black dove filled memories
secret wishes to the sky
i can hear them say,
"come back, darlin'
come back, darlin'"
yeah, we all know now
that they're piled high

life is a landfill, baby
you can feel it in your gut
dig down 50 layers
and you find the stone uncut
you can hear them say,
"come back, darlin'
come back, darlin'"
yeah, we all know now
it's a solo flight.
