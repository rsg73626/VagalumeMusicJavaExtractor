WHAT DOES T.S. ELLIOT KNOW ABOUT YOU?

What does T.S. Eliot know about you?
he knows nothing in particular
but you talk and talk as if he do

you bought that april stuff
just like an innocent pup
but all those months are equally cruel
when i rip off the mask
you wanna hang with slash
smoke bong hits by a heated pool

what does T.S. Eliot know about you?
he knows nothing in particular
but you talk and talk as if he do

yeah, you read half a book
then you say, "take a look!
T.S. is my new best friend!"
you just want showbiz kisses
from hollywood bitches
not visits from the hollow men

he knows nothing 'bout you
nothing 'bout you.
