CRYSTAL QUEEN

I want the crystal queen.
go call her on the phone.
she smells like cigarettes.
she feels like silicone.
she feels like silicone.

i want the crystal queen, hey.
she'll kill the dream.
she'll kill the dream, the crystal queen.

september '95 i bought her
i took her home a couple times,
now she never leaves.
she never seems to leave.

i want the crystal queen.
she'll kill the dream.
she'll kill the dream, the crystal queen.
