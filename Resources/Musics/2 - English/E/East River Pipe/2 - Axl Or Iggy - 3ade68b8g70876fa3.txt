AXL OR IGGY

You thought you were axl
or iggy
but you were nothing like that
but you looked good
with a bottle
and you smiled like a little brat

and i don't wanna go back
to your town

you thought you were axl
or iggy, but then
the dream came alive
then we went out
and they bought it all
and then i ran home again

and i don't wanna go back
to your town

you're caving in
you'll save yourself
you want it bad
like no one else
you won't get in
you won't get through
and everyone keeps telling you
you're fine
you're fine
you're fine

you say it when you drink
how that shrink was on fire
when you kicked him in the nuts
and tied him up with wire
you're fine
you're fine
you're fine
