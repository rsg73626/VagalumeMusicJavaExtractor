I'LL WALK MY ROBOT HOME

I'll walk my robot home
protect her precious dome
her bed of styrofoam
can never break

those little schoolboy hearts
you used to stop and start
they're coming back like works of art
that you find on the street

i finally found a way around you
finallly found a way to make you pay
forget about forgiving
i'll forget about you each and every day
goodbye, goodbye
goodbye, goodbye my baby
goodbye, baby baby baby it's goodbye.
