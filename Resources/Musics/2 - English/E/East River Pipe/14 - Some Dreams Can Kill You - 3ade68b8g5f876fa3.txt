SOME DREAMS CAN KILL YOU

Everybody's got a dream
some dreams can kill you
some just dry up and blow away
some booze and pill you

kids run down cobblestone streets
with light-up sneakers on their feet
next to suicide cases
and thumbtack schemes

here's to the girl from out the way
i raised your baby
crayons and papier-mache
yeah, here comes daddy

it's accidental, so you say
just nature's casual play
just some summertime traces
washed down a drain.
