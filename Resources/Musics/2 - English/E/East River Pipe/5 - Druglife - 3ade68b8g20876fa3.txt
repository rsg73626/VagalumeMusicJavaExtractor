DRUGLIFE

Hey, where's my pills?
they were sitting on the window sill.
should have known something was wrong when last week you tossed my favorite ball.
now it's gone.
you're messing with my drug life.
you're messing with my drug life.
flash up the union square.
people walk in serotonin pairs.
i remember it was only play
devil's sucking in the proteges.
just shuffle off through the golden mist.
take a number 'cause you're on the list
and later off second avenue
if it comes down to the drugs or you
baby, we're through.
'cause you're messing with my drug life.
you're messing with my drug life.
you're messing with my drug life.
you're messing with my drug life.
