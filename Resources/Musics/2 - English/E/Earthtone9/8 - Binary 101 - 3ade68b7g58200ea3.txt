BINARY 101

viewed from the darkest hole
outward face looking up
despair viewed down on, down on, down on
marked by a deeper scar
find the light i look for, look for, look for
these scars cause falls

i have need for outward
do i have to wait?
wait for this
i begin the long climb back on this rough terrain - long

dragged down to a new depth
balance lost again, again, again 
these scars cause falls

i have need for outward
do i have to wait?
wait for this
i begin the long climb back on this rough terrain - long
