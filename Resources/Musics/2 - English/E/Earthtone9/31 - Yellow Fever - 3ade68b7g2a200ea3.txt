YELLOW FEVER

[lyrics by ishmael lewis]

come one, come all
come one come all
chalk your eyes
blood for gall
blood for gall
this isn't the same world
your children are offerings
bow down
give thanks for their scant sufferings
chalk your eyes
the bigger the god so small the man
just this wooden horse remains

is this what you fought for?
is this what you fought for?
green order

this isn't the same world
this isn't the same world
she lies, sweet as the nurses veil
drink deep red ragged
this isn't your daughter 
chalk your eyes
the bigger the god so small the man
just this wooden horse remains

is this what you fought for?
is this what you fought for?
green order

you can blame the weatherman 
but it's pouring down inside
torn apart by goats wool
while the golden goose hangs high
you can blame the weatherman 
but it pours inside

green order green order
green order green order
