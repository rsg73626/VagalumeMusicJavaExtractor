SERPENTINE PLACEMENT

root in man and woman
god in child
the serenity no mask 
for the divinity they ask for
twist writhe serpentine

long day gone
day gone long

the diablo wandering
is unnoticed with roots in all known elements
speaking in tongues
now that god is the machine
now that they are indivisible
we walk with instincts
erased - erased

long day gone
day gone long
