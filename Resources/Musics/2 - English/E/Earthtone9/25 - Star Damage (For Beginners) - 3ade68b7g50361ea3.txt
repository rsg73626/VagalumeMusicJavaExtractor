STAR DAMAGE (FOR BEGINNERS)

i might not notice 
so come - just slip it in and see if i
you know i want this, so see what fits
you smell success 
it's just that i can only smell excess
can you navigate 
no please fuck me and leave a bitter taste
there is so much glass 
the glass, it's nothing but a lid of shards
but should we break it, when it's self imposed
but should we break this, mountain 
i see it through mohammeds eyes
so navigate me
fuck me again i like that salted taste

take a piece you've earned it
take a pound you've earned it 
i can feel the flesh burn, burning
take a piece you've earned it
take a pound you've earned it 
i can feel the flesh burn, burning

i'll be your vessel
i'll take that solid fist and then some more
don't mean to argue, i know you're right
hey spit or swallow, one fifth, 
you are lubed and up in me
so hey let's fuck now
you're the daddy, we owe it all to you

take a piece you've earned it
take a pound you've earned it 
i can feel the flesh burn, burning
take a piece you've earned it
take a pound you've earned it 
i can feel the flesh burn, burning
