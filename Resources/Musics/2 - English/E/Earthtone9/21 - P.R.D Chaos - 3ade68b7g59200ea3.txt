P.R.D CHAOS

lie to me, for a short while
lay with me, for a short while
i will wear my fears for you
i will wear my fears for you 

lay me down there's nothing done
closed eyes bring change 
too great, lost sometimes
closed eyes bring change
too great, lost sometimes 
i will wear my fears for you

ask a question
not just any
what am i, about being lost

closed eyes bring change
too great, lost sometimes
i will wear my fears for you

lie to me, for a short while
lay with me, for a short while
i will wear my fears for you
i will wear my fears for you
last caress and nothing done

ask a question
not just any
what am i, about being lost
ask a question, question, question
***live version of 'p.r.d. chaos' has karl shouting 
"raging fucking speedhorn!" at the end***
