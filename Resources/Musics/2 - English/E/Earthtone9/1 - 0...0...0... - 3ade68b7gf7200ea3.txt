thousand rays
thousand leaves
thousand breathes
thousand days

waiting for life to end
waiting for life to fall
i have never felt so 
ready in all my life

thousand names
thousand lives
thousand times
thousand seasons 

feel the breeze on my face
the water cleanse me
my hand in your hand
my head is in your arms

the shore is golden
we will have freedom

thousand questions
thousand reasons 
thousand fears
thousand years
waiting for life to end
waiting for life to fall
i have never felt so 
ready in all my life
