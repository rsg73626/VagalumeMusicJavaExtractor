REVELATION

the thread has frayed 
the fabric is wrenched
my hair and skin will repair 
a fear of fear 
but fear makes us whole
access recess
it hides like a trojan
like a trojan, like a trojan
cut this away
the debt must be paid
my pound of flesh is still warm
how many times
can this be replayed
the ships sinks i 
thought the cracks were papered
cracks were papered, cracks were papered 
clarity, clarity... clarity - show me
humility - give me
this thread has frayed
the fabric is wrenched
my hair and skin will repair
i cannot bear but chaos will thrive
reject program
the oceans will take us
take us oceans, take us oceans
clarity, clarity... clarity - show me
humility - give me
