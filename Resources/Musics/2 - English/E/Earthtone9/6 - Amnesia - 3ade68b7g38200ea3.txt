AMNESIA

i would walk 
to remember to forget
to remember to forget
what do i have to offer you 
the offer is not empty 
the glass is so full
i wish that i could show you proof
i know that you are a gift to me
i know that you are a gift to me
i will lay where i fall
little matters anymore
no need to fight the tide
all that i need is inside
i would wait 
to remember to forget
to remember to forget
i feel the suns warmth on my face 
like the most beautiful flower
you are lifes gift to me
i know that you are a gift to me
i know that you are a gift to me
i will lay where i fall
little matters anymore
no need to fight the tide
all that i need is inside
