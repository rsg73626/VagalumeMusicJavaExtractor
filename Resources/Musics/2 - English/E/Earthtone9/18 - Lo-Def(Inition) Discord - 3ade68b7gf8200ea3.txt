LO-DEF(INITION) DISCORD

you will never be the same again
you will never be the same again
you will never be the same again
you will never be the same

temptation
i feel it, i greet it
i know it has a fucking name
i breathe it through the gills
a distraction - undermined, overblown
the seeds are sown, rachet
caught in a grip that can only tighten

never, never, never
you will never be
never, never, never 
you will never be
