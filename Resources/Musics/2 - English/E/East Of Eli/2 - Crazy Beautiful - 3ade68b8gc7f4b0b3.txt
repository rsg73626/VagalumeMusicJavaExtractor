CRAZY BEAUTIFUL

Once upon a time
Never thought I'd find
Myself eye to eye
Smile to smile
Now for a while
Didn't notice passing time
And all I know
I was here alone
Before you walked by
Well it's nice to meet you

Come on let's talk
All I say is true
I'm an honest man
And patient too

I want you to know
Exactly how I feel
If this ain't true love
Then baby, true love ain't real
All these signs
All the writing on the wall
Tell me you're the one
You're so crazy beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
In my eyes I see your soul
Only love knows exactly how I feel

I'll hang the moon
I'll paint the stars
That you see inside your head
I can picture this
Can you picture that?
In my head it all makes sense
On a ride along
Once and for all
To a place of no regrets
Well it's nice to see you
Yeah, it's nice to see you

Unveiled in white
In a moment new
I'm one lucky man
Of ourse I do

I want you to know
Exactly how I feel
If this ain't true love
Then baby, true love ain't real
All these signs
All the writing on the wall
Tell me you're the one
You're so crazy beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
In my eyes I see your soul
Only love knows exactly how I feel

I want you to know
I need you to know
What it's like
What it's like
To touch the sky

I want you to know
Exactly how I feel
If this ain't true love
Then baby, true love ain't real
All these signs
All the writing on the wall
Tell me you're the one
You're so crazy beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
In my eyes I see your soul
Only love knows exactly how I feel
