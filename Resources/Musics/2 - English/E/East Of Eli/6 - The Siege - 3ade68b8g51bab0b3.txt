THE SIEGE

Up, down
Looking for the pieces
Looking where the peace is
Found now

In the light beyond the door
Behind those city walls
I can hear you call
Calling me home

I'm taking the the ground
Never like before
My heart has no doubt
I'll carry on, carry on

I'm wearing my crown
If I rise or fall
I'll keep pushing for
I'll carry on, carry on

Inside, searching for the moment
When I was lost and broken
Somehow
Feel like these were holes
Left me out here in the dark
I can hear you call
Calling me home

I'm taking the the ground
Never liked before
My heart has no doubt
I'll carry on, carry on

I'm wearing my crown
If I rise or fall
I'll keep pushing for
Carry on, carry on

Carry on, carry on
Into the dark
Carry on, carry on
On into the dark

I'm taking the the ground
Never liked before
My heart has no doubt
Carry on, carry on

I'm wearing my crown
If I rise or fall
I'll keep pushing for
Carry on, carry on

Just carry on
Carry on

Carry on
I'll just carry on
Just carry on
Into the dark
