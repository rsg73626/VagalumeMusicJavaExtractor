CHILD'S PLAY

Every sugar mama
Get back

Piece by piece
The petals fall
Tumble to the ground
I feel it's time, oh no
It's time she knows

He said, she said
The rumor swell
All my voice
Telling me, oh man
She's got
You under her spell

I gotta stop crawling
I gotta stop holding on
No more games

She calls my name
Then she runs away
Does she want me, yeah?
I can't explain
The rules of child's play
Does she love me, yeah?

Beat by beat
I got no plan
Moving to the rhythm
But I gotta take that chance
Oh, don't let me down

One step, two step
Out of breath
Looking for the words
And I hope I don't regret
Lord, help me now

I gotta stop crawling
I gotta stop holding on
No more games

She calls my name
Then she runs away
Does she want me, yeah?
I can't explain
The rules of child's play
Does she love me, yeah?

Do you love me?
Yeah, I know you love me
Do you want me?
Yeah, I know you want me

Heard that
Rewind the track
Ain't no time to find our way back
To what we are
Or what we were
Already passed the point of no return
I'm slow motion
now, sir
I'm taking that air to the out, sir
I slide and glide
I dance your time
C'mon girl
Here's your ticket to ride

You call my name
Then you run away
Do you want me, yeah?
I can't explain
The rules of child's play
Do you love me, yeah?

Do you love me, yeah?
(Rewind the track)
Do you love me, yeah?
(Already passed the point of no return)
Do you love me, yeah?
(Rewind the track)
Do you love me, yeah?
Do you love me, yeah?
