NOWHERE

When the earth begins to break
And I fall through
And the deaths take my sight
And I cannot find my way
When I'm buried underneath
Oh, I look to you
Oh, hold on to you

You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere to be found
You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere

All the wounds they make
A monster
And the scars
That tell the story of who I used to be
My hands begin to shake
And tremble from my past
I can not escape, my pain remains

You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere to be found
You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere

You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere to be found
You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere

Give it all, give it all
Give it all my love
I'm giving all, giving all
I'm giving all my love

Give it all, give it all
Give it all my love
I'm giving all, giving all
I'm giving all my love

When the earth begins to break

You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere to be found
You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere

You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere to be found
You remind me of true love
When it's nowhere

Give it all, give it all
Give it all my love
I'm giving all, giving all
I'm giving all my love

Give it all, give it all
Give it all my love
I'm giving all, giving all

When it's nowhere
