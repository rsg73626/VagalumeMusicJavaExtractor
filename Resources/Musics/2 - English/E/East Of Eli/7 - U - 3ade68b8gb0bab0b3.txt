U

Shook down, free fall
Somehow gotta hit the ground
Now, not out

You're right, I'm wrong
Can't hide, I can hear the
Sound, loud
I let you down

You speak your mind
Take your time
I'm strong enough
I'm no hero for what I've done
Can you see I'm breaking?

Laying on the line and now realize
Everything I've lost
No excuses, I payed the card, oh
I just wanna a
Second chance to tell you that

I know
I know it's my faul
I know better
I should've know better but

I won't
I won't make it alone
I know better
I never know better than you

Sick love, now what?
Hurt side, became so
Crowd, bound for all
Don't mind, take turns
I'm here to face the
Crowd, down
To take my round

You speak your mind
Take your time
I'm strong enough
I'm no hero for what I've done
Can you see I'm breaking?

Laying on the line and now realize
Everything I've lost
No excuses, I payed the card, oh
I just wanna a
Second chance to tell you that

I know
I know it's my faul
I know better
I should've know better but

I won't
I won't make it alone
I know better
I never know better than you

I'll drown in this silence
Til I hear every word
No motion to fight it
You just make youself
Free from all of hurt
I should've know better than

I know
I know it's my faul
I know better
I should've know better but

I won't
I won't make it alone
I know better
I never know better than you
