CRAZY BEAUTIFUL 2

Flash and light
The silence grow
What's that burning?
Is it over now?

Love through the fight
Been through the hurt
Now I'm surrounded
For better or for worse

Wanna break the silence
If we're gonna fall
Feel my heart
Hear my words
And know
There's no retreat and no regrets
Let me tell you
I'll love you until my last breath

All these days and forever more
You need to know
You're the one we're fighting for
All these moments you're giving me
I can't believe
You're so crazy beautiful

You're beautiful
So beautiful
Crazy beautiful life
In a crazy world

All these days I can't believe
I got to see you
You so crazy beautiful

I've seen your life
I've seen your soul
When the walls comes down
I'll keep you close
This photograph won't return
All sounds of danger tells for the worst
Out of time, no control
All I have is a moment to show
All you are and what you mean
I'm gonna speak these words
Until the last flight

All these days and forever more
You need to know
You're the one we're fighting for
All these moments you're giving me
I can't believe
You're so crazy beautiful

You're beautiful
So beautiful
Crazy beautiful life
In a crazy world
All these days I can't believe
I got to see you
You so crazy beautiful

Oh, beautiful
My beautiful
There's nowhere to run
I won't let you go

You're beautiful
So beautiful
There's nowhere to run
Gotta let you know

All these days and forever more
You need to know
You're the one we're fighting for
All these moments you're giving me
I can't believe
You're so crazy beautiful

All these days and forever more
You need to know
You're the one we're fighting for
All these moments you're giving me
I can't believe
You're so crazy beautiful

You're beautiful
So beautiful
Crazy beautiful life
In a crazy world

All these days I can't believe
I got to see you
You so crazy beautiful
