FAREWELL

Well, it's too late to compromise
You've already hurt me once
And baby, I can't take twice
God, I feel like hell tonight

Cause I know you care
I know you feel
So horrible about what you did
Baby, that don't make it right

So long
And I'm singing your farewell song
You know I hate to make this sacrifice
It's the only way I know
I can survive

It's to let go
Take my chances in a world unknown
You know I've given all I have to give
Walk away with no regrets at all
I'm ready for the fall

Maybe one day
I'll come to realize
I was better off to have you by my side
Now is not that time

The sooner that I'm gone
The sooner we both fall
The sooner we will learn
We can right this wrong
Now we have to carry one

So long
And I'm singing your farewell song
You know I hate to make this sacrifice
It's the only way I know
I can survive

It's to let go
Take my chances in a world unknown
You know I've given all I have to give
Walk away with no regrets at all
You ready for the fall?

Were did I go wrong?
I can fix this all
It's time to move on

So long
And I'm singing your farewell song
You know I hate to make this sacrifice
It's the only way I know
I can survive

It's to let go
Take my chances in a world unknown
You know I've given all I have to give
Walk away with no regrets at all
Except for the fall

Was it worth it after all?
God, I feel like hell tonight
