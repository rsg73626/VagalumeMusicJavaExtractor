BE OKAY

[Verse 1]
Bear witness, as we kick this - life's ass
Laughing at the mischief
We too busy talking about dicks in twit pics
To figure out who is more witless
And apathy sets in when we can't hear
No heroes, no wins, so we can't cheer
I'm feeling dumb enough to put a fucking chant here
Reinvent the wheel - no chance, so we can't steer
Top down like my whip was nice
I'm done faking being positive. I whip my life
Too cold for the heat tonight
I'm a maverick I shine like a Christmas light
But at the same time I Lebron James game 'em
I ain't even playing, and you know you can't trade 'em
Two tone jersey - Black Paisley stain
As I stand up, fist cocked; I ain't even aiming
I ain't even thinking. I ain't even bring my brain
I'm too gone for a status change
Tip up that new cup. Chug the new poison
No frills. Straight talk. Fuck that coy shit
I am killing robots. You are killing pop songs
I recycle chords, then I hit 'em with the bop gun
Yeah - but keep it happy on the chorus part
Cause you never know where the fuckin' tourists are

[Hook]
I said my cuts gonna heal and the scars gonna look okay
I'm gonna fix up sharp, go hard like all day
And when we get that win we gonna toast to the Old days
And they can talk that shit but we still gonna be okay
We gonna be okay

[Verse 2]
Back to the wall like a middle school dance
I handle these songs like a Liverpool band
Hey Ringo, the drums is lovely
But a bit too loud, now the mix is ugly
Eq them and grab the final
Take em' straight to the place where they press the vinyl
On the way back buy papayas
Phone Michael Caine's wife and the queen's vagina
No response? Well you best keep trying
These people are important they're short on timing
Spot a tea won't we while we sit here
Dumb subordinates never use fifth gear
It gets you there much faster now doesn't it?
Stupid Jaguar - shouldn't have a governor
No problem youre timing was love-ly
The birds just left just to toss off another one
