PUNCH THE WALLS

It's like the world is spinning, trying to keep up.
Shit, I'm trying to catch up.
And I'm too numb to cry...Or I just forgot how
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now?
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now.
Crying out now.

I punch the walls until my fists bleed but my life is not, is not changing.
Please hear the pain in these, in these words
Please hear the anger in me

It's like my heart is racing, trying to keep up.
Shit, I'm trying to catch up.
These walls you can patch up and and and hide my frustraion
But my my demons, you can't take them.
Why can't you take them from me?
Wish that you'd open your eyes and see that I...

I punch the walls until my fists bleed but my life is not, is not changing.
Please hear the pain in these, in these words
Please hear the anger in me
In me
In me

Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now

Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
Crying out now

I punch the walls until my fists bleed but my life is not, is not changing
Please hear the pain in these, in these words
Please hear the anger in me
In me, in me, in me

Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
Why can't you see that I'm crying out now
