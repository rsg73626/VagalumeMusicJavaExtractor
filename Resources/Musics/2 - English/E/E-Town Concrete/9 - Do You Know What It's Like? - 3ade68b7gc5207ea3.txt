Lessen programs promoting contraception if it means protection in the next election.
Religious groups will keep sending those checks in so we can start wars and keep sending those jets in.
Exactly just what kinda shit did we step in?
Exactly just what kinda message we sending?
It don't matter if you condemn condoms, it ain't your problem,
it's the type of thing that only happens in Harlem,
Happens in Compton, happens in Newark, it happens in Houston.
I think we got a problem Houston.
Invoke God to camouflage your true sins.
Poke and prod, private life intrusions;
You say it's for our safety when you spy our movements?
huh, well I don't buy it doofus, I ain't stupid this is my two cents.

You don't know what it's like to pray.

Let's spend some real money on real life improvements.
Instead of moon men and booing same sex unions.
We need to take a look at why society is loosing.
One room shack a single mother with two kids.
They share the same bed and the walls are too thin.
So they hear every fight.
Fourth grade kids who can't read or write.
And all they ever hear in mommy beat at night.
They can't sleep at night, they can't catch no Z's.
So what the fuck they care about the ABC's.
It's crazy kids in grades 1, 2, 3.
Trying to decide whether to be a B or C.
Their stomachs are empty there's not enough MD's but we can spend millions chasing WMD's.
Or we can just build a pipeline in the mid-east.
And when the bill comes, send it to me!
