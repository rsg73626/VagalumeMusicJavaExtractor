MORE THAN INCREDIBLE

I was born in the house of blues 
propelled by the winds of change 
entertained by the theater of pain 
Most of y'all have screamed my name
I played and paid both the same in dirty street puddles
stay forever in trouble head like a knuckle 
too big for that belt buckle my mom skimped it 
I got licked and cracked with folding chairs 
and bruised and then pursued
my skin is tough you can't stop me dude

I am more than incredible
track record is impeccible
turn this track up a few decibles
All I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
alright maybe more than a few decimals
more than incredible
track record is impeccible
turn this track up a few decibles
All I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
ok maybe more than a few decimals

I'm supposed to fall out and lose 
but I swear to God I will sustain
my arrogant ass will never change
I'm trying to set the world ablaze
and make a little spare change to I can cop that range
What I'm saying is I survived through madness
my tactics is brash cuz I never had shit
laugh at these so-called artistic bastards
afraid of success maybe cuz they can't hack it
I'll take my chances

I am more than incredible
track record is impeccible
turn this track up a few decibles
All I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
ok maybe more than a few decimals
I am more than incredible
track record is impeccible
so turn this track up a few decibles
All I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
alright maybe more than a few decimals

Even with them casters next to you
I'll bring and wreck the dudes
I'm disrespectable
my excuse is that I repped your rules
and plus I really don't expect to lose
My debut was like a spectacle in your ears ya left susceptable
so many hits that I can pick and choose
I'm rocking out like this is Motley Crue
Now your crew will soon be stopping who?
I don't think that you want it
I don't think that you do
I don't think that you want it
Do you?

I am more (4x)

I am more than incredible
track record is impeccible
so turn this track up a few decibles
All I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
alright maybe more than a few decimals
more than incredible
track record is impeccible
so turn this track up a few decibles
All I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
ok maybe more than a few decimals

cuz all I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
the same as you
all I'm really trying to do is live and stack a few
