PLOUGHSHARES VS. SWORDS

Beat the ploughshares into swords.
Initiate a state of perpetual quarrel, this shall never end.
Keep the coffers full.
Keep their coffins full.
Feed them fear to keep them tame, the king proclaimed.
You don't want what I want, I see it in your eyes.
You don't burn like I burn and even if you tried, you can't see what I see knowing what's inside.
You can't see what I see.
I know what you hide.
