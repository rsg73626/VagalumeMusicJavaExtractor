BATTLE LINES

i draw my line in the sand
cause this is where i intend to stand ..and thats my plain
you wanna snatch whats mine?? i'll trash your head
ya'll don't know my like that my friend
i try to make ya'll understand
i'm here to win, i ain't trying to make friends
so lose the smile, theres no need to pretend
-
if your not with us your against us
we can battle down in the trenches
your against us 
(for my next meal i'll eat you punks for breakfast)
X2
-
we are a vision for youth with no will to surrender
a flame inside that surns infanite
look in my eyes again, what do you see?
i'm unconquered and i'm risin to victory
