SICK WORLD

it's a sick sick world. 
die laughing, die w/ passion. die fast and go out blasting. 
when the only thing that matters is GI Joes, this world is 
less complex i suppose. if time froze at the age of innocence, 
life at it's purest form. the simplest. recognize change starts 
from within. remember before we started to sin? and kids 
were allowed to be kids? where's the innocence? 
die laughing, die w/ passion. die fast and go out blasting. 
fuck the world. keep blasting. 
they say there's something wrong with us. maybe we lost 
touch, maybe we fucked up. but i don't think there's 
something wrong with us, i think you lost touch. i think 
you fucked up. point the finger at your self this time. 
do we love our children or neglect them? when they speak 
do you listen? do you pay attention? pay attention. kids are 
starving for attention. for so long. ask yourself, where did 
we go wrong? 
call me insane. the internet has corrupted my brain. 
desensitized by video games. pulling me in. making me sin. 
recognize change starts from within.
