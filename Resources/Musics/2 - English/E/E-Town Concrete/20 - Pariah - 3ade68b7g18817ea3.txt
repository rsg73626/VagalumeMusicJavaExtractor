PARIAH

The choice between the devil you know and the devil you don't.
Use force to coerce compliance.
Use force if they don't.
You can slit their throats from ear to ear or put a noose tight 'round their neck.
They won't kneel.
We can't covert them.
We can bomb their homes from up above and burn down what is left.
They won't surrender.
We'll never break the will they have.
Pariah.
We're creating the hatred.
We're combating the hatred we create.
Is nothing sacred?
No.
The snake that eats its own tail destroys itself.
Compromise innocent lives in the name of wealth almighty.
Slit their throats from ear to ear or put a noose tight 'round their neck.
Bomb their homes from up above and burn down what is left.
Cut the limbs off of a child and the public buts the check.
Who cuts the check?
Pariah
