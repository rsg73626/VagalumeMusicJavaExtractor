SOLDIER

if god forgives, then god forgive me
because the pain I cause is the pain I feel. 
underachieve...
there is not much I'll ever be when all I see 
is the evil that surrounds me. 
if god forgives then god forgive me. 
if god forgives then god forgive me. 
you don't forgive. 
all I see is the evil that surrounds me. 

it's amazing how quickly the mind matures 
when the world outside creates internal war. 
I know, I know what's right... I do the wrong thing. 
my heart and soul will fade until emotions die. 
may the fire in my eyes light the way for me. 
may the bridges that I burn take out my enemies.
