GUARANTEED

growing up as a young buck, there wasn't too much 
that i could touch. and i was in a rush to get a taste of 
the good life. and people told me i was a waste of a 
good life. and i would not escape living the hood life. 
but yo, life is hell and that that's grown to be expected. 
the only way to cope with the pain is to accept it. times is 
hectic, we grow up quick. endure the hardships and watch 
our skin grow thick. in turn. you gotta learn my heads as 
hard as a brick, so can't nobody ever tell me shit. and 
that's the truth. as youth i hated all of you with a passion. 
those who never stood in my shoes would be laughing 
and cracking jokes while their two folks raked in the 
dough. x-mas 86' niggas had nintendo. word is bond, i ain't 
have shit...i had pretendo, and at show and tell i ain't have
shit to show. this goes out to those who thought shit was sweet. 
E.T.C. e.town concrete. and yo, niggas wanna be down 
w/ me. word is bond we taking over son, guaranteed. 
all ya'll niggas fake. ya'll niggas act too phony. 2 years ago 
you didn't even want to know me. but now look at you, 
you copy my style. you're lucky enough i let you still be 
around to play your weak shows in you weak ass town. 
we straight up beefing, when you see me i see you peeking. 
you just mad cause' my team rose while you were sleeping. 
center stage, took your limelight mad now you heated.
