WHAT CAN I DO?

Trying so hard to forget to remember.
One sip to take the sorrow.
One sip to face tomorrow.
Sip; swallow your pride, wallow and hide.
Hollow inside and I wish
That I could take the sun and make it shine;
Take your pain and make it mine.
I can't do anything at all.
I can't keep catching when you fall.
If I can't do anything at all, what can I do?
Open the bottle and erase your memories.
Stumble and fall, sipping and slipping away from it all.
Take your pain and make it mine.
Take the sun and make it shine.
Take your shoes and walk in mine.
Walk in mine.
