A FATHER'S MARATHON

live alone...die alone. 
Keep running. I'm supposed to be the sun in your sky, 
or the one that you would die for cry for give it all and 
lay it on the line for...but I'm not. I don't know you - you 
don't know me. I don't know my own dad and he don't 
know me.You turned your back and walked away. walked away. 
I spent 19 years without you, learned to fight without you, 
played catch without you, grew without you, learned to ride 
my bike without you. you're not a man, men don't run. 

I had to stand strong and tall and brave and barren. you never 
even gave me a chance you just ran. ran. 
took from your son, took your love. 
Keep running. you cant bring back the years, reverse my tears 
or fix the hole in my heart right here. you can't fix the hole in my 
heart right here. questions right here... daddy did you care? 
why were you not here? do you know my age? 
if so, how old am I now? how can't you remember when 
you made me? how can't you remember the seed you left behind? 
you're not a man, men don't run.
