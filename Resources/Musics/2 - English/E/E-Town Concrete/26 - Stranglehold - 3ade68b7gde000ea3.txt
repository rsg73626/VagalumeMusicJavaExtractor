STRANGLEHOLD

so you say it's love you show, huh? like you ain't know 
you tortured my soul. every day stunting my growth. 
put me in a stranglehold, so you can control. eating me 
away you don't even know. you took my innocence, 
pissed on it and put your dick in. i couldn't believe every 
night i pray "help me please" down on my knees. and 
you never answered me. 
one foot in the grave. no you cannot be saved. it's what 
you thought i should be. you can't fight destiny.
you took everything. everything. 
if you were so omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent, 
i'd kneel to you. all you ever showed me was thunder and 
rain, hunger and pain. help me find my way. help me find 
my way.you fucking pervert burn in hell i want to make 
you feel pain. if there was any god, he would take your 
worthless life away. make innocence your prey, then take it 
away. rape it away. burn in hell and i screamed...screamed 
for the lord. but no one answered my calls.
