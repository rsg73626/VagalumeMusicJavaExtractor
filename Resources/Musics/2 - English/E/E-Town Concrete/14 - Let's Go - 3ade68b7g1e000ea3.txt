LET'S GO

Everyday we hit the ground running. We keep the croud jumping. We keep the club bumping. We give you all something. It don't matter how we flip our style because we make it happen. So versitile I hit you screaming or I hit you rapping. Now what-cha yappin, shut your trap before you catch a slapping.It's our time,So Stop your whinning. It's out time and this was bound to happen. Now put your hands together and get to clapping. Clap-Clap-Clap. Before I get to clapping. 

You know that we rock. Ain't afraid to roll. You know that the concrete will crack your skull. I'm trying to make about a thousand O's. So Let's Go. You know that we rock. Ain't afraid to roll. You know that the concrete will crack your skull. I'm trying to rip about a thousand shows. So Let's Go.
