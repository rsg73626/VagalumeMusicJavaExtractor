A SETUP

Johnny never went to college. 
He couldn't afford the fee. 
He got lucky; he had an uncle who worked for NBC. 
Now Johnny's taking for people, 
who shop from the TV-mostly wealthy housewives who buy expensive jewerly. 

"It's a setup, keep you down. 
They set up you, then knock you"

Johnny got laid-off, his job sent overseas. 
He made about 50 bucks day, his replacement-$3. 
My mother never had much money; my grades were never all that great. 
So how fuck am I supposed to learn if eduation cost more than I make? 
And how fuck the am I supposed to earn when, 
good jobs want a college degree? 
Seven bucks an hour, what kind of future does that leave for me?!

"It's a setup, keep you down. 
They set up you, then knock you"(2x)

Johnny's is going through some tough times, 
and barely making both ends meet. 
He can't find a jod on account of the economy. 
Johnny's feeling desperate. 
He's got kids to feed. 
So the day I met Johnny, he robbing me.
