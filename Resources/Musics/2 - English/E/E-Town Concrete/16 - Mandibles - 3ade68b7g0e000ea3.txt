MANDIBLES

Take the bullet between my mandibles
It's the path I chose
Took life and I grabbed the balls
I rose like an animal
And the jungle taught me to handle foes

Take the bullet between my mandibles
It's the path I chose
Took life and I grabbed the balls
I rose like an animal
And the jungle taught me to handle foes

To all ya mother Effers
Heffers and half steppers
The best of us is yet to come
Ya'll aint seen the last of us 
I am that kid that nobody ever gave a ufck about 
Curse words and the worst words
Were the first words coming out my mouth 
We started out with nothing so we had nothing to lose 
Never had an option so there was nothing to choose 
And it was all about turning food stamps into cash, buy some 
Dipsey doodles with a food stamp
Get seventy-five cents back
What you know about that now? 

In my darkest hour it seems that I cant make it
I find the strength within to know that I can take it
Finger on the trigger...you know you better pull it
Barrel in my mouth, I learned to bite the bullet. 

Take the bullet between my mandibles
It's the path I chose
Took life and I grabbed the balls
I rose like an animal
And the jungle taught me to handle foes 

Take the bullet between my mandibles
It's the path I chose
Took life and I grabbed the balls
I rose like an animal
And the jungle taught me to handle foes

Im right here
