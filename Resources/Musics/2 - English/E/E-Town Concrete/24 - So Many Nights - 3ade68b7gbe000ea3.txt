SO MANY NIGHTS

so many nights i pray that this would just...stop...
i woke out of my sleep from the sound..of a pop lock
my heart would drop to the ground
maybey the fact my pops wasnt around force you to found
these guys that would just knock you down or beat you around
(i dont know) my inner sense was lost back then, not to be found
and in a sense its like this world was just weighing me down
leaning its weight hard on my shoulder
making my heart less warm and much more coulder
chip off my tooth and a chip on my shoulders
i told yall that i dont play..i seen that drama every god damn day
so go ahead yep yab away...cause now you got alot to say

CHORUS:
cast your judgement, cast, all your stoneS, holdin my hand, holdin on to everything i have because its slippin away soo fast and its all i have...

i was like six then we aint have a pot to piss in
while most kids lives consist of shine and glisin
my was lined with mischeif..a boy flippin
devoid the times you find joy or reminisin
its like time was pissin, years was passin..i was inside
while kids was out side laughin..no time for games
they fake toy planes was crashin,while me my life was crashin
at night fist fights left my moms face smashed in
her mans blastin..threw her down a flight of stairs
alone and scared,i stared in eyes of men who didnt care
my father was never there,now im am prepared for this lifetime
thats unfair,just like my fight from the bottom to the top,
just like i had to fight for all that i got, it hurts but i still wont stop
until my casket drops.

CHORUS X2

so many nights i pray that this would just stop
