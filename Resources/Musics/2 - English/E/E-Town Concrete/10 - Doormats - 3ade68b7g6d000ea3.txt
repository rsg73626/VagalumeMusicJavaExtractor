DOORMATS

Okay, I'm reloaded and all ya'll bastards is done freeloading.
We took the script, ripped it, cause we wrote it
And if you aint notice, I'm so goddam focused and

Dominant. While ya'll cats is a doormat.
Turn Em' into doormats, let my footprints adorn it.
cause I want it, and ya'll really don't.
I wish you really would, but ya'll really don't.

{ chorus )
We be tough like the concrete
We get right back on our feet.
We get up after we fall

We keep it gansta than mostest.
what you know about tours, sleeping on floors
with the rats and roaches?
we been paid our dues, matter of fact, we overpaid.
