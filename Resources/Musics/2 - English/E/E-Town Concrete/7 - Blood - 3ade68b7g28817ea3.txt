BLOOD

A bid farewell in pools of crimson.
A rose colored lullaby.
There can be no justice, it can't be taken back.
All the evil deeds you've done have left your hands all covered in the - Blood.
You can never make amends for the blood.
One day you'll suffer for your sins -
Massacres on top of slaughters,
To feed the drive that keeps a man that has still wanting more.
Like the Great White in the water.
The downtrodden have always paid the price through ther tears and - Blood.
You can never make amends for the blood.
One day you'll suffer for your sins -
Try to erase, but you won't ever atone for all the horrors that will never wash away.
