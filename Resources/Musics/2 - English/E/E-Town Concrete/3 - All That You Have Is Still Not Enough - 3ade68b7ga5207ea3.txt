ALL THAT YOU HAVE IS STILL NOT ENOUGH

Basicly I was just born bastard, long for green pastures
I am a pheonix, I was born from the ashes
The forms you take in the storm is what you makes strong
Anybody could perfrom like a charm when the waters calm
Ya'll don't know nathan 'bout the things I've been faced with
Can ya'll relate how I came from the basement?
I make the music and the same time faced it
I've been so close to my dreams I can taste it

Come on and punish me, the only thing that keeps me sane
I look to you for things I can not change
I need your blessing, do you approve?
My best was never good enough for you

So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long, I think I fell too far behind

I've swam beneath the icy waters, not comming up for air
I've spent my whole life living for those who didn't even care

So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind

I sat and thought for a while today
I got depressed and put the smiles away, 'cause I've been struggling
Since back in my childhood days, I've been walkin' since forever still I'm miles away
Maybe ya'll never forgave for my wilder days
Even though now I'm more wise in my ways
I'm losing faith in myself
Sometimes I doubt I'll even make it myself,
Whose gonna give it to me, if I don't take it myself?

Come on and punish me, the only thing that keeps me sane
I look to you for things I can not change
I need your blessing, do you approve?
My best was never good enough for you

So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind
