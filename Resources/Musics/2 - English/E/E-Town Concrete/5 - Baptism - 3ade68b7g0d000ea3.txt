BAPTISM

The day is mine
The night is also mine
Thou has set all the borders of this earth
I've never been one to believe
the preconceived limit thatâ€™s set for me
spit in the face of the haters as I march closer to victory
And my time is here, my time
And my time is now, now

Thatâ€™s gods honest combine this with the knowledge that I've acquired
Learn from my mistakes I'm baptized by fire, by fire
Thatâ€™s gods honest combine this with the knowledge that I've acquired

I've had, Iâ€™ve had the ground fall from beneath my toes
scraped my knees on the concrete still I rose
And my time is here, my time
And my time is now, now

Thatâ€™s gods honest combine this with the knowledge that I've acquired
Learn from my mistakes I'm baptized by fire, by fire
Thatâ€™s gods honest combine this with the knowledge that I've acquired

this war has just begun

and my time is here, and my time is now
and your time is here, and your time is now

Thatâ€™s gods honest combine this with the knowledge that I've acquired
Learn from my mistakes I'm baptized by fire, by fire
Thatâ€™s gods honest combine this with the knowledge that I've acquired

this war has 
this war has
