METROID

They say that which has been brought into the darkness 
Now come into the light
Step into the light
I've had my dreams slip out from beneath my nose
In a world so cold my heart was frozen
Journey beyond the pure white snow 
And emerge from the winter of my discontent
I won't consent to less than 110 percent
I won't remain lame, lick my wounds
I will not i will not repent now or bow to you

Hold onto my hand
Walk with me from your...your demise

I won't retreat
I won't be made weak by the THORNS in my feet
I will walk till I bleed
Dying from fatigue and beyond if need be
But believe me, you won't defeat me
That's a promise I keep until they drop me six feet deep
Motherfucker
