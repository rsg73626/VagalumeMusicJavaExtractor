THE PHOENIX

so i take another step, and one more breath 
closer to death. there's things going on in this 
world that got me stressed. lately i find myself 
searching my soul. looking for signs of life, 
a warmth in the cold. i'm young and restless 
and they want me to fold. i'm hard headed, i 
ain't never did shit i was told. i get too mad too 
fast over too much shit, but i put too much heart 
into the words i spit. maybe i'm too proud, 
maybe i scream too loud...but what goes in, 
must come out. and i'm hurting inside. i can't 
show it. obstructed by pride. i ain't being hard i 
just don't know why. fuck tomorrow if i live or 
i die. who comes first? you not before i. i'm still 
a ways off from my lofty goals, so fuck those 
who oppose and those who's acting like ho's. i 
ain't got time for ya'll. focus my goals. i chose. 
c'mon now, you just write ryhmes...i recite lifelines. 
you're in it for the long haul...i'm in it for a lifetime. 
let a brother try to come between me and mine. 
i'll lie cheat and steal to keep feeding mine. that's 
the deal and that's for real, by any means. am i 
wrong because i want the finer things in life? 
hell no. take this world by storm. 
all i ever wanted was a taste of. all i ever wanted
