MADE FOR WAR

Black clouds take hold like a pit bull when it locks it's jaws.
Trouble always had a funny way of finding some kind of path into my life.
I had to stand and fight.
I won't run.
I won't hide.
I'll stand and fight.
Thought I told ya'll when I sang before,
Better get an umbrella when it rains it pours.
We can bang 'cause I'm made for war.
If I get knocked down then I'll aim for more.
Lash out like a rat in a corner, with it's back to the wall.
Trouble always had a funny way of finding some kind of path into my life.

Thought I told ya'll when I sang before,
Better get an umbrella when it rains it pours.
We can bang 'cause I'm made for war.
If I get knocked down then I'll aim for more.
I spit metaphors for them kids with the souls that's lost.
We're here and we ain't fall off.
Talking soft?
Your shit gets tossed.
You can never know how hard we fought.
Feels like I'm breaking down.
Things have to turn around.
I just can't take it.
It feels like I'm breaking down.
I just can't make it.
And I pick myself off of the floor.
I waited to fight some more.
Thought I told ya'll when I sang before,
Better get an umbrella when it rains it pours.
We can bang 'cause I'm made for war.
If I get knocked down then I'll aim for more.
I spit metaphors for them kids with the souls that's lost.
