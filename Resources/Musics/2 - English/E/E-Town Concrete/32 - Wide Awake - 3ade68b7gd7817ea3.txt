WIDE AWAKE

I'm wide-awake.
Wide.
I'm wide-awake.
I see the moves that you're trying to make.
You think I'm sleeping be I'm wide-awake.
All this spinning makes me dizzy.
It makes me sick.
Color-coded fear to ensure you fall in line when they crack the whip.
I'm not scared.
I'm wide-awake.
Do you really trust the things they feed you in the news?
Corporations own the networks that help to skew our views.
I'm not fooled.
I see the moves that you're trying to make.
You think I'm sleeping but I'm wide-awake.
I know the moves you're trying to make.
You want me sleeping but I'm wide-awake.
Like a fault line moving beneath our feet; slipping slowly, you barely notice.
Until the ground gives way beneath you and the world crumbles down around you.
You want me under?
Put me under.
Put me under.
Put me under.
Wide Awake.
