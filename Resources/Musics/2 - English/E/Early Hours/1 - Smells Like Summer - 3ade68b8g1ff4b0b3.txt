SMELLS LIKE SUMMER

Let your hair down
And put on your party dress
Let's live our favorite story
With no second guess
Told me it's all easier
When you do what you're told
Borrow my leg to stand on
Let's get out of control

Give me my daily dose of your coquetry
Yeah, I've put some thought into poetry
A summer's eve shall I compare to thee?
Or is it not to be?

Oh, it smells like summer
It smells like summer
It feels like letting go
Oh, it smells like summer
Your smile's like summer
I think we ought to let him know
We won't be waiting for the weekend
We're waiting on the sun
We don't need anyone's permission
To have a little bit of fun

Good stories always come from bad ideas
And yesterday was boring
So let's end in tears
Time waits for no man
So we won't wait for time
This isn't going to end well
But it started out fine
Here's an ideal: sleep when you're dead
Come over here, sleep with me instead
Let's get it started, it is getting late
This won't end well, but the middle is great

Oh, it smells like summer
It smells like summer
It feels like letting go
Oh, it smells like summer
Your smile's like summer
I think we ought to let him know
We won't be waiting for the weekend
We won't be waiting on the sun
We don't need anyone's permission
To have a little bit of fun
