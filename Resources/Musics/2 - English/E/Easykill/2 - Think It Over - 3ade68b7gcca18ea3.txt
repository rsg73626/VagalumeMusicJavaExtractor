THINK IT OVER

This is a head on collision
Everybody is hurt
A mutual decision 
More trouble than it's worth

You left the motor running
But you left it in reverse
I tried to make it better
You only made it worse

You better think it over
You better think again
I'm gonna' drive you furthur
Riding you to the end

Hello are you a survivor
Or should we go again
Cause you caught it all on camera
Cut me out of the frame

You better think it over
You better think again
I'm gonna' drive you furthur
Riding you to the end
You better think it over
You better think it over
You better think it over
I'm riding you to the end
