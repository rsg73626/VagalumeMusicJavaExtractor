DEAD IN THE WATER

I hold my hands up,
I messed up,
Pulled and pushed my luck,
Addicted to the cuffs you tighten up, tie me up

Dont wanna be there when they find you.......yeah

I hold my head up
I messed up,
Snatched and grabbed my stuff,
Addicted to the way she liked to fuck,
Fucked me up.

Dont wanna be there when they find you,
Dont wanna be there when they find you, find you

Keeping it alive,
Dead In The Water
Theres a fire inside,
Dead In The Water
And everybodys sinking,
Dead In The Water
But were all tongue tied.
Dead in the water, here we go.

I tied your hands up,
Dressed you up,
Lights and camera stuff
Twisted in the focus gotta sharpen up
Its not enough.

Dont wanna be there when they find you,
Dont wanna be there, when the lights come find you,
Dont wana be there when they, when they find you.
