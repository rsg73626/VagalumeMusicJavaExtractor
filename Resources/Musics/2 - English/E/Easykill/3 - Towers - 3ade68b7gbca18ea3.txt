TOWERS

You seem like lost boys,
Is that a play on words?
Am I implying what you think you heard?
i'm Punching twice my weight from here to traitors gate,
So let me get this straight, now youre a punkok

You are a mystery,
Youre a myth to me
And if the legends true that if the ravens flew
Id be on the wall, and Id shoot them all

Go sing your song,
You know its wrong 
Your just a pawn,
Go tell someone

All The lies you told
Will come right back ten fold
Because the legends true, yeah the ravens flew,
I was on the wall

Go sing your song,
You know its wrong 
Your just a pawn
Go tell someone
