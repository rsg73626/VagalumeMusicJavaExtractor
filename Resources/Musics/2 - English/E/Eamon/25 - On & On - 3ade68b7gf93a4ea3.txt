ON & ON

On and on and on [2x's]
On and on and on [2x's]

Everytime i finish i could see it in your eyes
I know i put in work and there is no surprise
I got just what your looking for
Yo I freak it like you like it
Then you want some more
Let's explore the bedroom floor
Over and over and over

On and on and on [2x's]
On and on and on [2x's]

Anytime you need me, girl you know im by your side
And i know that you know that i can make it right
I feel just how you feel tonight
Let me prove what i can do
To make the feeling right
Hit the lights and let me ride
Over and over and over

On and on and on [4x's]
On and on and on [4x's]

Everytime i finish i could see it in your eyes
I know i put in work and there is no surprise
I got just what your looking for
Yo i freak it like you like it
Then you want some more
Let's explore the bedroom floor
Over and over and over

On and on and on [4x's]
On and on and on [4x's]

On and on and on .. .. .. [till fade]
