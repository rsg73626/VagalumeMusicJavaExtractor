SHE HAS NO TIME

You think your days are uneventful
And no one ever thinks about you
She goes her own way
She goes her own way 
You think your days are ordinary
And no one ever thinks about you
But we're all the same
And she can hardly breathe without you 

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time 

Think about the lonely people
Then think about the day she found you
Or lie to yourself
And see it all dissolve around you 

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time 

Lonely people tumble downwards
My heart opens up to you
When she says 

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
