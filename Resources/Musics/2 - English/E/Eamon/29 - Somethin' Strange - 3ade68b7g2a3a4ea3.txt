SOMETHIN' STRANGE

I'm seein something I ain't seen before
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
Could it be your actin like a whore
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange

When I met you everything seemed right, but the truth is you fucked on the first night, it
Sank in slow now I know your a ho, I shoulda listened when my friends told me so, I thought
This would last, but I realized that your just a piece a ass
I know your game chicks are all the same
Your lookin kinda funny and your actin kinda strange

I'm seein something I ain't seen before
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
Could it be your actin like a whore
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange

I caught you in the club last week you looked like a freak in the VIP, sittin on laps and
Suckin on necks, actin like a slut cause your trippin on X
I flipped, I was gonna hurt her, then my boy said chill, call for murder
I was feelin nice til my boy told me he just saw the bitch bounce with Milk Dee

[MILK DEE]
Who me, MC am I, E I didn't know that was your ho thats why, I took her to the bathroom, I
Had her face in the bowl, with a tight grip hold, loosin control when I hit it, I didn't have
A clue, if I knew she was you I wouldn't of did it, thats my word 
Truth so fuck what you heard, it ain't no beef when it comes to a bird

I'm seein something I ain't seen before
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
Could it be your actin like a whore
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange

I'm seein something I ain't seen before
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
Could it be your actin like a whore
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange

I'm seein something I ain't seen before
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
Could it be your actin like a whore
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
