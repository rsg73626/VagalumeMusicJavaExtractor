BRING HIM HOME

I got the first flight out when I finished up the tour,
because I missed you.
I even flew home a day too soon all because
I couldn't wait to kiss you.
Oh how she will be loved, was the one thing
stuck in my mind, and how tonight would be
remembered for the rest of your life!
I never thought that I'd do something like that,
when I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack,
Oh No! How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd loose my temper like that,
Now its some fucked up situation, he ain't coming back! Oh No!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?
I know you know I missed on other girls because I thought
I really loved you, and you know I never put anyone
or anything above you, because I loved you, and it
was that love that made me loose my head and now
its too late!
One day too soon, you'll regret it for the rest of your
days!
I never thought that I'd do something like that, when
I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack,
How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?,
I never thought I'd loose my temper like that, Now
its some fucked up situation, he ain't coming back! Oh No!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?
I never thought that I'd do something like that, when
I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack, Oh No!
How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd loose my temper like that,
Now its some fucked up situation, he ain't coming back! Oh No
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?
yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, oh, oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, oh, oh,
Please God forgive, for what I did, this day will stay
for as long as I live,
'cause if you walked in and seen what I seen I know
any man would have done just the same. Please God forgive,
No! for what I did, No!
This day will stay for as long as I live,
'cause if you walked, No! In and seen what I seen,
No! I know any man would have done just the same because...
I never thought that I'd do something like that,
when I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack,
Oh No! How could you let somebody in through our door?,
How could you bring him home?
