(HOW COULD YOU) BRING HIM HOME

I got the first flight out
When I finished up the tour
Because I missed you
I even flew home a day too soon
All because I couldn't wait to kiss you
Oh how she will be loved
Was the one thing stuck in my mind
And how tonight would be
Remembered for the rest of your life

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no!
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's some fucked up situation
He ain't coming back!
Oh no!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

I know you know I passed on every girl
Because I thought I really loved you
And you know that I'd never put anyone
Or anything above you
Because I loved you
And it was that love that made me lose my head
And now its too late!
One day too soon, you'll regret it for the rest of your days!

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no!
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd loose my temper like that
Now its some fucked up situation
He ain't coming back!
Oh no!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

Hey-e-ay-e-ay
Oh,u,oh,u,oh
Hey-e-ay-e-ay
Oh, oh, oh

Please god forgive
For what I did
This day will stay for as long as I live
'cause if you walked in
And seen what I seen
I know any man would have done just the same
Please god forgive (no!)
For what I did (no!)
This day will stay for as long as I live
'cause if you walked in (no!)
In and seen what I seen, (no!)
I know any man would have done just the same
Because...I

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no!
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?
I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now its some fucked up situation
He ain't coming back!
Oh no!
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

Hey-e-ay-e-ay
Oh,u,oh,u,oh
Hey-e-ay-e-ay
Oh,u,oh,u,oh
Hey-e-ay-e-ay
Oh,u,oh,u,oh
Hey-e-ay-e-ay
Oh,u,oh,u,oh
