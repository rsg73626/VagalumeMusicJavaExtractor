I LOVE THEM HO'S (HO-WOP)

Yeah...
Girl i thank ya for this wondeful night
Wishing i could see ya one more time
But i don`t think ya will love me
So i thank you
If you wanna still fool around
You can come to the next town
But until then i gotta go 
So i thank you

I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's [4x's]

Looking sad, even though we just met
No need to get upset
But i got a show, gotta go, so i thank you
And if you wanna still get sexed down
You can catch the next greyhound
But until then i gotta go, so i thank you

I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's [4x's]

Oh, lettin' you know that i love them ho's [4x's]
