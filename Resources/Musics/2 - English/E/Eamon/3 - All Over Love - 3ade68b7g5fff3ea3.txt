ALL OVER LOVE

"All Over Love"

Hard to believe it, its kind amazing, but its true, now that I need
Someone so special, here comes you.
So how am I crazy, to say that I'm dream in over you
Someone so special, how could you say this all so cruel.

So when your sayin that you need love
I look at you, and kind a smile
It's very hard just to convince baby, so maybe this will take a while.

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With a little love and squeeze in and hold you close, girl its driving me crazy

All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love 

Now that we started, lets make a relationship at last
Getting to know you, with nothing  to owe you so I ask
Lets keep this real simple, we know that material things won't last
Show me you love me, if anythings different, then I'll pass

So when your say that you need love
I look at you, and kind a smile
It's very hard to just to convince you baby, so maybe this will take a while

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With a little love and squeeze in and hold you close, girl its driving me crazy

All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love 

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With a little love and squeeze in and hold you close, girl its driving me crazy

All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With alittle love and squeeze in and hold you close, girl its driving me crazy

All over love 
All over love 
All over love 
All over love
