MY BABY'S LOST

"My Baby's Lost"

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It's like that, its like that, like that, like that, like that, like that

Had the earth and the sweat and the sticks and the brews adn knew she was feelin me to
Passed the bone, gave the eye, and I knew for sure what she wanted to do

Can't stop thinkin about my baby girl
And how she done love me so long
Next thing that I think ?
But the poison let me go
Found doin
I was with her friend
Knew I was gonna pay, we were sexin like everyday
She found out, she was like no doubt
Do what you gotta do, I fucked your friend this afternoon,
Whoa, my babys lost

Came outta that got my shit off track, had the bitch trapped now shes caught like that, my
Babys lost, ain't no comin back shes gone just like that, like that, its like that, like that,
Like that, just like like that, like that 

As the days went by had the evil chills and went about my devilish ways
Called her up, picked her up, all we did was fuck, now were both was in a daze
Bein blazed all the time, never ever helped, my mind was always up in the sky
If I could I would, I'd take it back cause it hurts so much inside

Found doin
I was with her friend
Knew I was gonna pay, we were sexin like everyday
She found out, she was like no doubt
Do what you gotta do, I fucked your friend this afternoon,
Whoa, my babys lost

Came outta that got my shit off track, had the bitch trapped now shes caught like that, my
Babys lost, ain't no comin back shes gone just like that, like that, its like that, like that,
Like that, just like like that, like that
