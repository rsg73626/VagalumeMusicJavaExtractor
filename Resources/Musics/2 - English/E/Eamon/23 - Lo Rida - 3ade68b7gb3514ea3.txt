LO RIDA

[N.O.R.E.:] 
Yeah, it's like 2:30 in the morning, just left the club, about to go to the after-hour, after-hour spot, ya gotta dig 
That, over there, over there, ya know how we do it. get my lo rida, hit some switches, yeah, yeah, any highway from here to 
You, ya know what i mean? we gonna ride. eamon, let's ride, eamon, yeah, ya know what i'm sayin, let's ride, lo rida, come on! 

[EAMON:] 
Feelin high, gotta ride it, i take routes to ease my life and there's no doubt i test my life, still i, i step back, 
Step back, and let the feelin take control, may be hard, may be soft, and what ya had might be lost, but i got to, got to, 
Not care what i'm goin through 

[CHORUS:] 
The lovin, and the huggin, the way i just can't stop buggin, the feedin, and the schemin, the way i get when i'm weaken. 

[CHORUS 2:] 
Lo rida, can't get higha, all i gotta do now is calm that fire, love makin, shit that i'm takin, can't get enough 
Of it, lo rida, can't get higher, all i gotta do now is calm that fire, love makin, shit that i'm takin, can't get enough of it. 
Yo, it's been sent to find my cost, and, you might think it's my loss, but i'm rollin, rollin, to the illest place i know, 
Eyes are wide, inside's hot and, nasty thoughts just won't stop, and i'm lovin, lovin, everything that ya do to me 

[chorus] 

[chorus 2] 

[N.O.R.E.:] 
Ya see i never had a chick like this, we'd argue, she'd break out, come back like this, she said she never had a pimp 
Like this, and never seen a camouflage make like this, suckin that lo rida, we on that cali side, i'm the insider, we 
Buffin, takin the valley ride, i'm a provider and stay high up from tiger shots, we played wrestle before, nelsons and body 
Shots, oh, excited like we're, until we're "gatti bots", look at her booty, man, got me on body watch, she got a leather 
Trench on now, with nothin under it, just like when she on top and i'm under it, so i run with it, gotta have fun a bit, 
Ain't nothin like a hoeside, lo ride, new kicks, new whip, "sit safe" 0-5, nice eyes, thick thighs, boy, she make my skin 
Rise! 

[chorus 2, repeat]
