then noticed your ass was fly
I just thought we could have fun,
I could show you affection.

I want you so bad girl, I want you, I need you so bad.

I will make your life complete, just sit back and have a seat,
let my lips just touch your lips,then I'll move down to your hips.

I want you so bad girl, I want you, I need you so bad.

Check it out girl, your to damn fine
Check it out girl, just let go
