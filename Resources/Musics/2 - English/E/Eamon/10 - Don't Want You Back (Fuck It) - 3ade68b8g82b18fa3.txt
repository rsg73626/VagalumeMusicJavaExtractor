DON'T WANT YOU BACK (FUCK IT)

See I dont, know why, I liked you so much
I gave you all, of my trust
I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain
You put me through pain, I wanna let you know how I feel

[chorus:]
Fuck what I said it dont mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack
Fuck you hore, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it dont mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it did'nt mean jack
Fuck you hore, I don't want you back

[verse 2:]
You thought, you could
Keep this shit from me, yeah
You burnt bitch, I heard the story
You played me, you even gave him head
Now you askin for me back
Just another hag, look elsewhere
Becouse you done with me

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it did'nt mean jack
Fuck you, hore, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it did'nt mean jack
Fuck you hore, I don't want you back



You questioned, did I care
You could ask anyone, I even said
You were my great one
Now it's, over, but I truly mean I'm sad
It hurt real bad, I can't sweat that, becouse I loved a hoe

Fuck what I said it dont mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it did'nt mean jack
Fuck you hore, I don't want you back
