BY MY SIDE

See the situation's complicated 
I done tried and waited, getting so impatient 
I'm wishin I could go back in time 
Wishin I could press rewind 
Now even though I treated you wrong 
You still held on so long 
Baby, you thought about quittin but the feeling's so strong 

No matter what I do, I lose 
It seems like all the time I gotta prove to you 
If you walk a mile in my shoes 
Then you'll see that there's nothing that I won't do you 
Whoa, felt this so long, feeling so strong 
Feenin for it everyday (everyday) 
I could never walk away 
I'd make you stay?by my side 
Whoa, I never knew love would do me this way 
How'd it ever come to this (come to this) 
So what I gotta do to prove my love to you, girl 

Feel like I'm goin crazy, baby 
Need your love to save me 
But it still feels like I'm wastin my time 
Tell me what's on your mind, oh yes 
Now, baby, you just need to stay 
I'm hopin that you never leave 
I can't help but take this bait 
Cause I know you're the only one for me 

And no matter what I do, I lose 
It seems like all the time I gotta prove to you 
If you walk a mile in my shoes 
Then you'll see that there's nothing that I won't do for you 
Whoa, felt this so long, feeling so strong 
Feenin for it everyday 
I could never walk away 
I'd make you stay?by my side 
Whoa, I never knew love would do me this way 
How'd it ever come to this 
So what I gotta do to prove my love to you, girl 

Damn, I wish we never had these feelings 
Yeah, I know that both our hearts need healing 
Fighting, waiting, hoping, patient 
Call you up and tell you, things I never told you 
Pleading for you loving, wishing I could hold you 
Tell me what you're thinking, takin what you're givin 
Singin what I'm living, hopin that it's the bomb 

Whoa, felt this so long, feeling so strong 
Feenin for it everyday (everyday) 
I could never walk away 
I'd make you stay?by my side 
Whoa, I never knew love would do me this way 
How'd it ever come to this (come to this) 
So what I gotta do to prove my love to you, girl 

Whoa, felt this so long, feeling so strong 
Feenin for it everyday (everyday) 
I could never walk away 
I'd make you stay?by my side 
Whoa, I never knew love would do me this way 
How'd it ever come to this (come to this) 
So what I gotta do to prove my love to you, girl
