CONTROVERSY

"Controversy"

On my way to the studio, when the beat rise through, like pure as gold.
And you know I got 'dro to up my flow
When the girl I brought along just dropped her clothes.
And even if its true what you said, I could have your girl chillin in my bed
So theres no need for controversy, what you gotta stop is all this envy.

What I gotta do, cats don't even have a clue, can't stand to see me kick a flow so
unbelieveably.
Never gave a hand, askin bout the back up plan.
Now that is true, for ever tellin me that you always knew

On my way to the studio, when the beat rise through, like pure as gold.
And you know I got 'dro to up my flow
When the girl I brought along just dropped her clothes.
And even if its true what you said, I could have your girl chillin in my bed
So theres no need for controversy, what you gotta stop is all this envy.

Such a funny face,you actin all outta place, but I'd love to know, how you really know how
far I go
Don't gotta choice, gotta play kids like its toys
Don't gotta flap, you keep poppin shit, while i spit facts

On my way to the studio, when the beat rise through, like pure as gold.
And you know I got 'dro to up my flow
When the girl I brought along just dropped her clothes.
And even if its true what you said, I could have your girl chillin in my bed
So theres no need for controversy, what you gotta stop is all this envy.

Please don't get mad at my talent, I just wanna meet my balance.
Blaze trees, blaze girls, make money
So much jealousy, its funny
What I bring is a whole new moment
?
Stop all the hate that your makin
Smokin, singin, girl takin

On my way to the studio, when the beat rise through, like pure as gold.
And you know I got 'dro to up my flow
When the girl I brought along just dropped her clothes.
And even if its true what you said, I could have your girl chillin in my bed
So theres no need for controversy, what you gotta stop is all this envy.
