ON A DAY LIKE TODAY

On a day like today
I looked at you and I
Saw something in the way
You stared into the sky 
I saw you were sick
And tired of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you 

But I could never seem to say the things I needed to
On a day like today no other words would do 

I saw you were sick
And tired of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you 

But I can never find the words to say and I don't know why
I can't find the words to say and I don't know why
