FUCK IT (I DON'T WANT YOU BACK)

Whoa oh oh
Ooh hooh
No No No

[Verse 1:]
See I don't, know why, I liked you so much
I gave you all, of my trust
I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain
Ya put me through pain, I wanna let you know that I feel

[chorus:]
Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack
Fuck you hoe, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you hoe, I don't want you back

[verse 2:]
You thought, you could
Keep this shit from me, yeah
You burn bitch, I heard the story
You played me, you even gave him head
Now you asking for me back
You're just another hag, look elsewhere
Cuz you done with me

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack
Fuck you hoe, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you hoe, I don't want you back

You questioned, did I care
You could ask anyone, I even said
You were my great one
Now it's, over, but I truly mean I'm sad
It hurt real bad, I can't sweat that, cuz I loved a hoe

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you'll go, I don't want you back
