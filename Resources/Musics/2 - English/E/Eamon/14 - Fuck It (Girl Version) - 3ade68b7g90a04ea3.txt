FUCK IT (GIRL VERSION)

Oh oh 
oooh 
no no no 

You know there are two sides to every story 

See I don't know why you crying like a bitch 
talking shit like a snitch 
Oh write you, write a song about me 
if you really didn't care 
you wouldn't wanna share 
telling everybody just how you feel 

2x Refrain: 
Fuck what I did was your fault somehow 
fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out 
fuck all the crying, you didn't mean jack 
well guess what yo, fuck you right back 

Hey you thought that you could really make me moan 
I had better sex all alone (ha ha ha ha) 
I had to, to do your friend 
now you want me to come back 
you must be smoking crack 
I'm going else where and that's a fact 

2x Refrain: 
Fuck all those nights I moaned out real loud 
fuck it, I faked it, i'll rent you out 
fuck all those nights you thought you broke my back 
well guess what yo, your sex was wack 

whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 
whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 
whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 
whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 

You questioned did I care 
maybe I would howl if you wanna come to me 
now it's over 
but I do admit I'm glad I didn't catch your crabs 
I can't swear bad cause I got to go 

Refrain: 
Fuck what I did was your fault somehow 
fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out 
fuck all the crying, you didn't mean jack 
well guess what yo, fuck you right back 

whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 
whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 
whoa whoa 
uh uh yea 
whoa whoa 
uh uh yea
