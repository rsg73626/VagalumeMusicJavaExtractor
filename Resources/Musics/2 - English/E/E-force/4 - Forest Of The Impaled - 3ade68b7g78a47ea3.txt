FOREST OF THE IMPALED

The Land Beyond The Forest
Ruled By An Iron Fist
Awaits The Prince Of Darkness
Risen From The Abyss
The Order Of The Dragon
Revolt And Be Destroyed
Born From The Blood Of Demons
Armies Now Deployed

Castle Built High In The Mountains
Invaders Must Be Aware
Witness The Blood And The Conflict
Prisoners Wait It To Be Impaled

Impaling Victims Alive
And Did Not Show No Mercy
Killing All He Despised
Dying For Their Country
Paralyzed With Horror
Seeing Death Was Near
Long Live The Impaler
Warlord You Must Fear

Cross Into The Land Of The Phantoms
Invaders Must Be Aware
Witness The Blood And The Conflict
The Forest Of The Impaled
