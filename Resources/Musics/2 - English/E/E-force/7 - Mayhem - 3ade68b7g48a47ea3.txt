MAYHEM

With All The Blood That's Spilled
You've Had To Change Your Life
Start It Over Again And Rise
What Appears To Be So Real?
Does Not Appear To Be
So Make The Sacrifice

Time To Weight It Out
And Form A Separate Life
No Way They Can Deny
Feel A War At Hand
No Way They Can Survive
Hear Them Calling Out Their Lies

Revenge - Mayhem - Reset - Vengeance
Reset - Repress

Reset - Repress

Complicate Their World
Torture And Confine
Poison All Their Veins Of Life
Manipulate The Weak
Intimidate Their Minds
Contaminate All Their Bloodlines

Revenge - Mayhem - Reset - Vengeance
Revenge - Mayhem - Reset - Mayhem
