SCARRING

Walk Into The Front Line
Wanton This Century
Wanton I Am
Until The Last To Be
No Fault For Your Poor Soul
Don't Run You Cannot Yell
Into The Right To Reign On
Into The Reign Like Hell
Into

Go Ahead, You Can't Borrow
Scarring, It's Your Downfall
Scarring, To Feel Like I Am
Scarring, Sold

So Clone The Victims
Even Now They Rush In
Quarantine, The Truth Denied
No One Will Last Long

Scarring, You Want More
Scarring, So Finally I Am
Scarring - Drowning - Rotting
Rot
