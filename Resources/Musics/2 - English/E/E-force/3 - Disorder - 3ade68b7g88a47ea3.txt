DISORDER

You Felt Their Presence
Out From The Sun
You Saw It Coming
Damage Is Done
You Wreak Havoc
You're Pissed Off
You Breathe Disorder
You've Had Enough

Intuition - Premonition

A Shade Of Anger
Shadow Of Hate
Begin To Question
Life's Out Of Place
Believe Your Instincts
And Follow Through
Your Guess Was Right Man
It's Like You Knew

Intuition - Demolition
