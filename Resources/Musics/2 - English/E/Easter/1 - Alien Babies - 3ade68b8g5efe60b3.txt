ALIEN BABIES

I see alien babies
I see soy protein
I see your finger reaching out
I see the world spinning

I see ginseng in bottles
I see horsheshoecrabs on shore
I see food being flowers
I see cheese I see more

I see alien babies
I see litchins in cans
I see forever glass noodles
I see jelly in your hand

I see mushrooms
Being born out of shrimps
I see mushrooms
Being born out of shrimps

I look at your jaw, it's dancing with me
Your jaw at the disco is all I see
To far away to touch it but too close to really try
Looking at your jaw I'm so happy I could die

I see silberfish
On the bathroom floor
Dancing ways around my feet
I see you opening the door

I see alien babies
I see you healing your wounds
I see pearl tapioka
I see little mushrooms

I see soft centered eggs
On our hotel plate
I see metamorphosis
I see the stuff that you ate

I see mushrooms
Being born out of shrimps
I see mushrooms
Being born out of shrimps

I look at your jaw, it's dancing with me
Your jaw at the disco is all I see
To far away to touch it but too close to really try
Looking at your jaw I'm so happy I could die
