BLOODY NOSE

Tell me a lie, tell me a story.
Tell me anything, don't you worry.
Tell me about the booze and the Bowery,
And all about the drugs in the morning.

I've seen your face before,
Though I didn't recognize
'Til you walked out the door.
And I've seen that face before,
Now I'll always wonder why,
Don't know me anymore.

We'll take the car down the highways,
We won't get fooled by the bad days.
And all the money we took from the last one,
Clean your bloody nose in the bathroom.

I've seen your face before,
Though I didn't recognize
'Til you walked out the door.
And I've seen that face before,
Now I'll always wonder why,
Don't know me anymore.

I've seen your face before,
Though I didn't recognize
'Til you walked out the door.
And I've seen that face before,
Now I'll always wonder why,
Don't know me anymore.
