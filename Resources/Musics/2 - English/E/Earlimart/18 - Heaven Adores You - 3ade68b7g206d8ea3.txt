HEAVEN ADORES YOU

Stepped on a crack
Thought you had broke your own back
Things that you want
That you bought and stole

You knocked on the door
Tell me what it's all for
Who am I supposed to be?
Anyone but me

Got dirt on your face
Still you got something to say
Gonna make it alright
If you find the time

And Heaven adores you
Heaven adores you
Heaven adores you now.
