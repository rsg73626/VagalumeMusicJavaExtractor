BURNING THE COW

It's where we're from and we'll always be
But we won't let 'em get to us
So come on, come on, we choke on the dirt
So come on, come on, we choke on the dust
But we won't let 'em get to us

Burning the cow
Burning the cow for so long
Oh, oh, oh

They got new lights up above
But you know it's the same
And we won't let 'em get to us
So come on, come on, we choke on the dirt
Yeah, come on, come on, the smoke on the dust
But we won't let 'em get to us

Burning the cow
Burning the cow for so long
Oh, oh, oh

Burning the cow
Burning the cow for so long
Oh, oh, oh

Burning the cow
Burning the cow for so long
Oh, oh, oh

Burning the cow
Burning the cow for so long
Oh, oh, oh

Burning the cow
Burning the cow for so long
Oh, oh, oh
For so long
Burning the cow
For so long
Oh, oh
