IT'S OK TO THINK ABOUT ENDING

It's ok to think about ending
and it's ok to not even start
put it away and wait till tomorrow
put it away and take care of your heart
of your whore heart

And it's ok to stay here forever
and it's ok to read in the dark
put it away and wait till tomorrow
put it away and take care of your heart
of your whore heart

Just for awhile
i'll sing and smile
just for awhile
i'll sing and smile
