WE'RE SO HAPPY

It's been a while
But we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy
Uh huh
To wash our feet off
To hang upside down
Uh huh

To call someone out
Just to come out here
Uh huh
We won't cause we're happy
Yeah we're happy
Uh huh

Yeah, we're so happy
We're so happy
Uh huh
We're so happy
Ha

Yeah, were so happy
We're so happy
Uh huh
We're so happy
We're happy
Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh

And we left the piano
In the truck
