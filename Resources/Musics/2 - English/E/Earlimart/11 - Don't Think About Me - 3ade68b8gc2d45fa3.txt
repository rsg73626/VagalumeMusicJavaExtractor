DON'T THINK ABOUT ME

And if the time is right
You'll say goodbye
But don't you, don't you think about me
Do you ever think about me?

You said your love ain't dead
Just disappearing instead
But don't you, don't you think about me
Do you ever think about me?
Don't you think about me

Boy, ain't that sad
Oh, it's just too bad
Boy, ain't that sad
Oh, it's just too bad
Do you ever think about me?
Don't you think about me
Do you ever think about me?
Don't you think about me
