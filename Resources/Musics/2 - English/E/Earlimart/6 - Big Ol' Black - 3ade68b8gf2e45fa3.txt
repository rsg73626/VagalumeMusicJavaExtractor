BIG OL' BLACK

Big ol' black
Big ol' black bugs crawl inside of us
We'll kill it fast, kill it fast because
There's no room left for, left for

And the fever, the fever has begun to greet us today
An old photograph, photograph of how, we once looked okay, okay, okay

The killers, the killer's here
The killers, killer's here
Killer's here
