ANSWERS & QUESTIONS

I'm shaking hands with the one imperfect
The one imperfect side of you.
I know the answers, I know the questions,
I always thought that you did too.

I'm wide awake I'm watching you
All night long, tell me what to do.
I'm wide awake I'm watching you
All my lies they tell the truth.

A family tradition to teach you a lesson
Of self control everybody else knows.
I know the answers, I know the questions -
If this is nowhere now it shows.

I'm wide awake I'm watching you
All night long, tell me what to do.
I'm wide awake I'm watching you
All those lies you told them too.
