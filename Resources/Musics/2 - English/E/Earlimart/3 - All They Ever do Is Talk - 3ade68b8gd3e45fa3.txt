ALL THEY EVER DO IS TALK

If they come in just to meet you
with broken words in monotome
and smile and take the picture
...It's nice to know you love the songs

Then someone will remind you
Nothing hurts until it's gone
My New Year's Resolution
Cause all they ever do is
Talk

What's the language that they're speaking
Can only make out certain words
There's money for the taking
And the happiness we all deserve
Then someone will remind you
Nothing's good until it hurts

My New Year's Resolution
Cause all they ever do is
Talk
