FIRST INSTANT LAST

first instant
last report
you threw that all away
to think of futures in the same phrase
we took that away
above the floore
above the floor
i've been down before
to show my face
keep my head straight
i wave my goodbyes
cause everyone's got broken promise
this plan we impovise
above the floor
above the floor
i've been down before
i'm above the floor
i'm ablove the floor
i've been down before
la, la, la, la, la
first instant
last report
we threw that all away.
