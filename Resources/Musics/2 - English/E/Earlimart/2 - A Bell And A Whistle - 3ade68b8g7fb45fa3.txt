A BELL AND A WHISTLE

Sunday nights
are nice for hospitals and homes
Answering the phone
and what if I
could take us both away from here
Far away, my dear

Stay at home
Writing letters full of love
and the stars above

Put your records on
and listen to the songs
Always sing along
Lalalala

Sunday nights
are perfect when they're just
just the two of us
