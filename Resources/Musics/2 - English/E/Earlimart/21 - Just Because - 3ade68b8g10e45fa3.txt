JUST BECAUSE

Turn out the lights
And everything is fine.
Lock down the doors,
And that's what we're paying you for.

One more smack in the mouth,
Learn what fear is all about.
Open your eyes,
Find your faith in Jesus Christ.

And we're down
Underground.
Hiding out upside down
Just because,
Just because,
Just because I don't believe in you.

And we're down
Underground.
Hiding out upside down
Just because,
Just because,
Just because I don't believe in you.

No, I don't believe in you.
