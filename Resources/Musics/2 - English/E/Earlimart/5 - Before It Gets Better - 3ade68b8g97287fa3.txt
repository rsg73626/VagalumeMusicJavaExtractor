BEFORE IT GETS BETTER

there's a light 
that just won't go out 
no matter 
what they try to do 
'cause you can't pull 
out the circuits 
remove the bulb 
or blow the fuse 
and it just might be 
the brightest star 
discovered yet by man 
but it might as well 
be a pin hole 
from where we stand 
there are times 
when I thought 
it'd be easy to ignore 
but it just takes one look 
and I don't believe 
my theory anymore 
I won't get upset 
I won't fight it 
I'd have no escape in mind 
but the distant roar 
of the highway 
just won't subside 

so don't leave soon 
don't leave this room 
we'll be on top of the moon 
but 'til then 
it's a bloodbath 
it's a bloodbath 
it's a bloodbath 
and it's getting worse 

in a crowded room 
there are people 
planning our time 
and the next time 
I know when I see them 
they will be older 
and we'll be fine 

you can count up 
all of your friends 
who still really know 
you on just one hand 
and the others 
that come around too 
they'll understand 

so don't feel bad 
don't look so sad 
we're much more than that 
but for now 
it's a deathtrap 
it's a deathtrap 
it's a deathtrap 
it's a bloodbath 
and it's gonna get worse 

and it's gonna get worse 
it's gonna get worse 
before it gets better
