FAKEY FAKE

Always been down with one of them too
You were the fake and I was the fool
But you were too young to know all the rules
So I was the fake and you were the fool

Something undone, words went unsung
I'll never be clean, you know what I mean
But you were too young to know all the rules
So I was the fake and you were the fool

Something that's warm
Something that's good
Can never be free, not that it should.
