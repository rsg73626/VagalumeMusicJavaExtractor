WE DRINK ON THE JOB

Right before you go to bed
I'll still be buzzed around just like you said
And we'll get down to the end
We drink on the job

Our heads are set up and too tired as hell
But well, we still got a few stories to tell
And we'll get down to the end
We drink on the job

And we'll get down to the end
We drink on the job
And we'll get down to the end
We drink on the job
