EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY

Only wanted revenge
Or someone else to offend,
I watch myself 'cause everybody knows everybody.
I said everybody knows everybody.

Choose an alternate end
Without involving my friends.
I always thought that you'd keep it to yourself
But can you keep it from everybody else?

Cause everybody knows everybody.
I said everybody knows everybody.
Cause everybody knows everybody.

But do you know you?
And would you want to?

Don't believe in revenge,
It's just another expense.
Growing up has been talked into the ground
And letting down everybody.

Cause everybody knows everybody.
I said everybody knows everybody.
Cause everybody knows everybody.
I said everybody knows everybody.
