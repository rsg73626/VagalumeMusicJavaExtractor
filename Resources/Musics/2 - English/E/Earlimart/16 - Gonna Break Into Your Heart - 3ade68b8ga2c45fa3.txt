GONNA BREAK INTO YOUR HEART

You know we're trying but you're still not smiling,
Undercover from the sun that's shining
For you.

A blind date with the broken hearted,
Sleeping tight while the war's just started
All around you.

We gotta know, who you fighting for?

You know we love you but we're just not certain
About the colors of the walls and curtains.
So we thank God.

So stay awake with your thoughts and the silence,
Reacquainted with the truth you're hiding
From us.

We wanna know what you're waiting for?

But it don't matter to me,
Cause we won't need to agree.

I'm gonna break into your heart,
Gonna break into your heart,
Gonna break into your heart,
Gonna steal it from the start,
Everything just falls apart
Everything just falls apart

I'm gonna break into your heart,
Gonna break into your heart,
Gonna break into your heart,
Gonna steal it from the start,
Everything just falls apart,
Falls apart.
