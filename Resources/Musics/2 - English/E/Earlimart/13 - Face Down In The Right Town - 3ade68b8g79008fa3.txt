FACE DOWN IN THE RIGHT TOWN

So you did what you thought was right
Oh giving up the fight
The only way that we knew was wrong
Got me hanging on and on
It's everything you want
Everything you need

And the people who counted on
Let you down one by one
So be sure what you're asking for
Telephone don't ring no more
It's everything you want
Everything you need

Ooh in the right crowd
Face down in the right town
No good uptown
But maybe somehow
We'll get back home

Don't care who walks through the door
The life I paid twice for
Rearranging the furniture
It reminds me of who you were
It's everything you want
Everything you need

Ooh in the right crowd
Face down in the right town
No good uptown
But maybe somehow

Ooh in the right crowd
Face down in the right town
No good uptown
But maybe somehow
We'll get back home

We'll get back home
We'll get back home
We'll get back home
