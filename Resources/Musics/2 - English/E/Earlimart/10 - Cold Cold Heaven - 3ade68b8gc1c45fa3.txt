COLD COLD HEAVEN

I used to dream from the lost and found -
It's just a dream that's been let down.

So I'm going back to heaven underground.
Yes, I'm going back to heaven underground.

We believe in silent sound -
Yes we believe in upside down.

So we're going back to heaven underground.
Yes, we're going back to heaven underground.

And it's a cold, cold, cold heaven underground,
And you're deserved of what you're given Until now.

I used to dream from the lost and found -
It's just a dream that's been let down.

So I'm going back to heaven underground.
Yes, I'm going back to heaven underground.

And it's a cold, cold, cold heaven underground,
And you're deserved of what you're given Until now.
Until now.
Until now.
Until now.
