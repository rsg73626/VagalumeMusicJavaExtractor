SALVAGED

A new revelation of false intentions 
and misconceptions has been exposed. this
Is how the story unfolds
Is how the story unfolds

The number of deceived have been lost over the years.
Betrayed everyone who has listened with open ears.
Blessings have been mistaken for power.
Exposed our shame to hide your guilt.

How is it possible to take the broken promises back?
When all they've done is push us further and further away.
How is it possible to take the broken promises back?
When all they've done is push us further and further away... away.

We are blinded by our insecurities.
To find the beauty within is an understatement.
The assessment is no good and the prognosis is poor.
Brace yourselves (the impact is inevitable).

This crash has devastated my hopes of survival.
There s no one left to point the finger at.
I ate up all of your lies.
With every word you say, a part of me callously dies.

And now I've come to a point where all seems lost.
Father, I place my pain before your throne 
and acknowledge my shame.
Take everything. use what s left of this wreckage.
Salvage the broken pieces.
Take everything. salvage the broken pieces.

I am plagued but I am not broken.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
Oppressed but still I stand.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
Oppressed but still I stand.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
Oppressed but still I stand.
I am plagued but I am not broken.
Oppressed but still I stand.

I am too weak to take this cup.
I asked for it, but had no idea it would overflow 
so quick in so little time.

Control has slipped through my hands and
I am too crippled to grab a hold of it once again.
They've exposed our shame to hide their guilt,
But love covers a
Multitude of sins.

Calm these storms and rescue me from the sea!
