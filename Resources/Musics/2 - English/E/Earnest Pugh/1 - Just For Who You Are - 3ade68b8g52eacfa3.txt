JUST FOR WHO YOU ARE

To you, we give the glory
To you, we give the honor
To you, we give the glory and the praise
Not for what you've done
Not for victories won
Oh Lord, just for who you are

For who you are, for who you are
Just for who you are

Jehovah Jireh, that's who you are
Jehovah Nissa, that's who you are
Jehovah Rofi, that's who you are
Jehovah Rohi, that's who you are

You are holy, that's who you are
You are righteous, that's who you are
You are joy, that's who you are
You are worthy, that's who you are

Lord, I praise you
Lord, I bless you
Lord, I adore you
Lord, I love you
Lord, I lift you up
Higher (repeat)

Just for who you are
