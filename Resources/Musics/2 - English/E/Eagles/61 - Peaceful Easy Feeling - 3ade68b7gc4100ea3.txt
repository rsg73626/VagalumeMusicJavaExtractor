PEACEFUL EASY FEELING

I like the way 
your sparkling earrings lay 
against your skin, so brown 
and I wanna sleep with you 
in the desert tonight 
with a billion stars all around 

'cause I gotta peaceful easy feeling 
and I know you won't let me down 
'cause I'm already standing on the ground 

And I found out a long time ago 
what a woman can do to your soul 
Ah, but she can't take you anyway 
You don't already know how to go 

and I gotta peaceful, easy feeling 
and I know you won't let me down 
'cause I'm already standing on the ground 

I get this feeling I may know you 
as a lover and a friend 
but this voice keeps whispering 
in my other ear, tells me 
I may never see you again 

'cause I get a peaceful, easy feeling 
and I know you won't let me down 
'cause I'm already standing 
I'm already standing 
yes I'm already standing 
on the ground
