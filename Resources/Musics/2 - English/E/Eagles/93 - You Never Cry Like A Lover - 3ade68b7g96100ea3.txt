YOU NEVER CRY LIKE A LOVER

You never cry like a lover should 
Sigh when it feels real good 
Or see the sky through the stone and wood 
You never cry like a lover 

I thought I saw somebody I loved 
Sleeping deep inside you 
If I could catch you in an unguarded moment 
I'd stay right here beside you 

You never smile at me late at night 
Laugh out loud when we get it right 
You can't get loose if there's too much light 
You never smile like a lover 

I can't live with you baby, can't live without it 
And sometimes I believe in love 
Sometimes I doubt it 
But your life goes on 
Like a broken down carousel 
Where somebody left the music on 

You never move like you used to do 
Pour it out when you're feelin' blue 
Somebody must have put some pain on you 
You never cry like a lover 
(You never Cry Like a Lover) 
Cry 
(You never cry like a lover) 
You never cry 
(Cry like a lover) 
Come on and cry
