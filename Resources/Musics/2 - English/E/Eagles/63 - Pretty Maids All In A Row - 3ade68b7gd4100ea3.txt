PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW

Hi there, 
                            How are 'ya? 
                            it's been a long time 
                            it seems like we've come a long way
                            My, but we learn so slow 
                            and heroes, they come 
                            and they go 
                            and leave us behind as if 
                            we're s'pposed to know why 
                            Why do we give up our hearts to the past? 
                            and why must we grow up so fast? 

                            And all you wishing well fools 
                            with your fortunes 
                            someone should send you a rose with 
                            love from a friend, 
                            it's nice to here from you 
                            again 
                            And the storybook comes to a close 
                            Gone are the ribbons and bows 
                            Things to remember places to go 
                            Pretty Maids all in a Row
