WITCHY WOMAN

Raven hair and ruby lips 
sparks fly from her finger tips 
Echoed voices in the night 
she's a restless spirit on an endless flight 
wooo hooo witchy woman, see how 
high she flies 
woo hoo witchy woman she got 
the moon in her eye 
She held me spellbound in the night 
dancing shadows and firelight 
crazy laughter in another 
room and she drove herself to madness 
with a silver spoon 
woo hoo witchy woman see how high she flies 
woo hoo witchy woman she got the moon in her eye 
Well I know you want a lover, 
let me tell your brother, she's been sleeping 
in the Devil's bed. 
And there's some rumors going round 
someone's underground 
she can rock you in the nighttime 
'til your skin turns red 
woo hoo witchy woman 
see how high she flies 
woo hoo witchy woman
