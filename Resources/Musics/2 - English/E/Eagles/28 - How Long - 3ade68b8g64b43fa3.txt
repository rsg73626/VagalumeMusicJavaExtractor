HOW LONG

Like a blue bird
with his heart removed
lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run

If I never see
the good old days
shinin' in the sun
I'll be doin' fine and then some

How long
How long
woman will you weep

How long
How long
rock yourself to sleep

Well I been doin' time
in lonesome prison
where the sun don't shine
Just outside the freedom river runs

Out there in that shiny night
with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?

How long
How long
woman will you weep

How long
How long
rock yourself to sleep

Everybody feels alright you know
I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooooo)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools
no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite
what you choose

Tell me
How long
How long
woman will you weep

How long
How long
rock yourself to sleep

How long
How long
Muddy river runs so deep

How long
How long

Good night baby
rock yourself to sleep

Sleep tight baby
rock yourself to sleep

B-B-B Bye bye baby
rock yourself to sleep
