VISIONS

Visions, that you stir in my soul 
Visions, that will never grow old 
Sweet baby, I had some visions of you 
If I can't have it all, just a taste will do 

Go ahead and live all your fantasies 
(Don't you ever think about the other side?) 
Helps you get from where you are 
To where you want to be 
(You and me oughta be taking a ride) 
You do the best you can 
And you make your mistakes 
(If you don't like it, you can say that you tried) 
'Cause all I have to give is whatever it takes 

Play on, El Chingadero, play on 
Play on, El Chingadero 

Dance, angel, dance 'til you wear out your blues 
(Only thing that's gonna save you now) 
Take another chance, you got nothing to lose 
(The boy didn't love you anyhow) 
Girl, you drive me wild when you do what you do 
(Something makes me want to take you down) 
If I can't have it all, just a taste will do
