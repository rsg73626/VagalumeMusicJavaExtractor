SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD

There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges road

There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time, sweetened honey
 Down the Seven Bridges road
