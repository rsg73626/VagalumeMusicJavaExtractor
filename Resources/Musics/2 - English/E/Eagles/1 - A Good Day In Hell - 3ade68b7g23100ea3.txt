A GOOD DAY IN HELL

Move in, 
Can't you see she wants you 
She has you deep in her eyes 
You been wond'rin' why she haunts you 
Beauty in the devil's disguise 
She can tell you all about it 
She sees it in the stars 
She'll burn you if you try to put her down 

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound 

Higher, 
She can keep you loaded, 
Feedin' you whiskey and wine 
Fire, 
The devil's on the phone, he laughs 
And says you're doin' the just fine 
In that big book of names I wanna go down 
In flames 
Seein's how I'm goin' down 

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound 

Truckin', 
That's all that I've been doin' 
Ev'ry girl's a fork in the road 
Stuck in some sticky situations 
Feelin' like I wanna explode 

All this gratification and sick conversation 
Someone get me out of town 
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
