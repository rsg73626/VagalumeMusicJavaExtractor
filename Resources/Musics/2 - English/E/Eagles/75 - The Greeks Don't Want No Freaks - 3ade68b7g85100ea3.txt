THE GREEKS DON'T WANT NO FREAKS

There was beer all over the dance floor 
and the band was playin' rhythm and blues 
You got down and did the gator, and half 
an hour later, you were barfin' all over your 
Girlfriend's shoes. 

But the Greeks don't want no freaks. 
The Greeks don't want no freaks 
Just put a little smile on them rosy 
cheeks, 
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks. 
(GATOR!!) 
She was the pride and the passion of Dixie 
She did exactly what her daddy had planned. 
She was perfect little sister until somebody missed 
her and they found her in the bushes with 
the boys in the band 
But the Greeks don't want no freaks 
The Greeks don't want no freaks 

So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks, 
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks 
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks 
Said, the Greeks don't want no freaks 

Just put that monster smile on them rosy cheeks 
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks 
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks,
