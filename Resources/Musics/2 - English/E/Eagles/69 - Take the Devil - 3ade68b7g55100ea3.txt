TAKE THE DEVIL

Open up your eyes 
take the devil from your mind 
he's been holding on to you 
and you're so hard to find 
the wind outside is cold 
restless feeling in my soul 
tempting me to get away 
but there's no place a man can go 
God, will you lead me where I roam? 
Help me not to let my feelings show 
No, No You are the one, oh, how could you be 
so blind? 
the devil prays on runaways 
he's never far behind 
the many years I've tried 
Now have been revealed to me 
closer is the love you'll find 
waiting so patiently 
God, Will you lead me where I roam? 
Help me not to let my feelings show. 
NO, NO 
Take the devil 
Take the Devil
