DOOLIN-DALTON/DESPERADO REPRISE

The queen of diamonds let you down, 
She was just an empty fable 
The queen of hearts you say you never met 
Your twisted fate has found you out 
And it' fin'lly turned the tables 
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret 
Desperado 
(Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?) 
You sealed your fate up a long time ago 
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?) 
Now there's no time left to borrow 
(Is there gonna be anything left?) 
Only stardust 
(Maybe tomorrow) 
Maybe tomorrow 
Maybe tomorrow 
Desperado 
Desperado 

Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down 
As they came to town to face another showdown 
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets 
"All you blood -thirsty bystanders, will you try to 
find your seats?" 
Watch 'em duelin' 
Doolin-Dalton 
High or low, it's all the same 
Easy money and faithless women 
You will never kill the pain 

Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why 
Sooner or later we all have to die? 
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact,
