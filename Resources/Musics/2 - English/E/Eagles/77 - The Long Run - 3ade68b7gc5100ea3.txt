THE LONG RUN

I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of the day
Oh that didn't get it, it was high time, I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way
Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely till I found you

Who can go the distance?
We'll find out in the long run
(In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one
(Is a strong one)

People talkin' about us, they got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down we will still come through
In the long run
Ooh I want to tell you it's a long run

You know I don't understand why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
When all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you
Did you do it for love, did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite, did you think you had to, honey?

Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out in the long run
(In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one
(Is a strong one)

Well we're scared but we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent but we ain't breakin'
In the long run
Ooh I want to tell you it's a long run
