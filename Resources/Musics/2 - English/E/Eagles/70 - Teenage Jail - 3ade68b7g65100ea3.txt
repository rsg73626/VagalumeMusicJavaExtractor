TEENAGE JAIL

Stare out the window, 
You can't make the time go 
You don't even know why you're here 
Wait for the weekend to go off the deep end 
and make everything disappear 
You're lost in a teenage jail 
So you and so vicious and so frail 
where something is always for sale 
You're lost in a teenage jail. 

You're not like your mothers. 
you're not like the others 
You're not quite like anyone else, 

They don't even know you, 
Got nothing to show you, 
So get something good for yourself 
You're lost in a teenage jail 
So young and so vicious and so frail 
Where something is always for sale.
