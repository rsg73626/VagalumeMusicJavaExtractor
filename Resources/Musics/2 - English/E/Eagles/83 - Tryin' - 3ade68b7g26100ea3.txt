TRYIN'

I'm just arriving in the city 
and there's music on my mind 
lookin' for my destination and 
my home is far behind 
'Cause it's a long road ahead 
and you can make it in the end 
and I'm gonna make it with my friends 
And I'm tryin' 
It took me sometime to see it 
now I'm looking through this world 
and it's gonna take some time before 
I get back, help me girl 
'cause you can make it if you try 
you gotta lay it on the line 
and everything will be fine if you try 
Sittin' smokin' just a thinkin' 
is an easy thing to do 
We gotta keep on trying for 
the feelin' to come through 
and it's a lonely way to live 
you gotta take it, you gotta live 
if you mistake it, just try again 
and I'm trying, yeah! 
Got to keep on trying 
Ah, we got to keep on trying
