I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE

It's not the first time
That I've had the sense that something's wrong
But I'm old enough to know
That things don't always work out like they should
I know you're tryin' hard
To break it gently to me, now
But there's no easy way
To tell it like it is, so baby...

I don't want to hear any more
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I've seen that look before
I know it well; it comes as no surprise
You've been avoiding me
But now you want to talk it over
Before you take my hand
And tell me softly in a whisper
There's no need to explain
I've read the book; I know how this all ends

I don't want to hear any more
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
Look me right in the eyes
Let me walk away with my head high

If there's some other guy
I don't need to know why

But I don't want to hear any more
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
And I don't want to hear any more
No, no, baby
I don't want to hear any more
