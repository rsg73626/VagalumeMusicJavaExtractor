THOSE SHOES

Tell us what you're gonna do tonight, mama. 
There must be someplace you can go 
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama, 
there must be someone you know. 

God knows, you're lookin' good enough, 
but you're so smooth and the world's so rough. 
You might have somethin' to loose. 
Oh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna 
do in those shoes? 

Got those pretty little straps around your ankles 
Got those shiny little chains around your heart. 
You go to have your independence 
but you don't know just where to start. 

Desperation in the singles bars 
an' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars. 
you can't believe your reviews. 

Oh, no, you can't do that, 
once you started wearin' those shoes 

They're lookin' at you, leanin' on you 
Tell you anything you want to hear 
They give you tablets of love 
They're waiting for you 
got to score you 
handy with a shovel and so sincere 
Ooh, they got the kid glove 

You just want someone to talk to 
They just wanna get their hands on you 
You get whatever you choose 
Oh, no, you can't do that,
