FAST COMPANY

Now, where you going?
Now, what's the rush?
You listen here
No, you just hush
I know what you think
That man don't know anything
But I've been around a while
I know what's happening

Everybody wanna check you out
Everybody wanna be your friend
And all this pressure
Where do I fit in?
They don't know nothin' you don't know
Ain't got nothing you ain't got
But you keep on runnin', you keep on runnin' with the

Now it's alright
To have some fun
This is your turn
Your life has just begun
You're racin' out the door
Don't have very much to say
Your motor's runnin' hot
You can't wait to get away

Lookin' up the road ahead
You can't see very far
Remember where you come from
Remember who you are
Be careful what you say
Be careful who you trust
This world is beautiful
This world is dangerous
