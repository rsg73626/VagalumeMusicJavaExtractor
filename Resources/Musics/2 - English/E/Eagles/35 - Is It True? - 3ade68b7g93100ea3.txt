IS IT TRUE?

How come you love him when he 
Takes you for a fool 
He's only lookin' for a good time 
How can he love you when he 
Treats you mean and cruel 
He's not the best thing that you could find 
Is it true? 
I can't believe it 
Is it true? 
I just can't see it 
Is it true? 
Is that you? 

When we were young, we didn't really have a care 
You were hung up, I had a good line 
I never knew it then but, man, I was in love 
How could I know it was the right time? 
Is it true? 
You've lost that feelin'? 
Is is true? 
You might be leavin'? 
Is it true? 
Don't wanna find out 

Yes, I was so wrong 
For leading you on 
There wasn't much I could do 

I was a wild one, but I can change some 
If that's important to you 
Is it true- you've lost that feelin'? 
Is it true- you might be leavin'? 
Is it true? 
Is it true? 
She's really leavin'
