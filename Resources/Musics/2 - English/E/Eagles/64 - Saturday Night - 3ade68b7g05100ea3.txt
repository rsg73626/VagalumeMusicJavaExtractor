SATURDAY NIGHT

Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago 
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow 
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring 
The bluebird was high on the wing 

Whatever happened to Saturday night 
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight? 
She said,"Tell me, oh, tell me, was I alright?" 
Whatever happened to Saturday night? 

The years brought the railroad 
It ran by my door 
Now there's boards on the windows 
And dust on the floor 
And she passes the time at another man's side 
And I pass the time with my pride 

What a tangled web we weave 
Go 'round with circumstance 
Someone show me how to tell the dancer 
From the dance 

What ever happened 
To Saturday night? 
Choosin' a friend and loosin' a fight 
She said,"Tell me, oh, tell me, are you alright?" 
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
