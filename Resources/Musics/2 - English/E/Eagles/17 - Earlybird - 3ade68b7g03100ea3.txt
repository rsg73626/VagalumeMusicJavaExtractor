EARLYBIRD

Early in the morning 
about the break of day 
the earlybird is working 
so his life don't fade away 
spends his life denying that 
he's got no time for flying 
in the breeze 
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone 
and he is free 
Earlybird is scratching though 
the going's getting tough 
time is passing by him and he just 
can't get enough 
He'll tell you all is well when 
all is really going wrong 
the Earlybird will wake one day 
and find his life is gone 
You know I like to lay in bed 
and sleep out in the sun 
Reading books and playing crazy music 
just for fun 
You know it makes feel so fine 
and puts my mind at ease to 
know that I don't harm a soul 
in doing what I please 
aaahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhhh ahhh..... 
Any old day you say, 
ain't gonna fade away 
any old day you say,
