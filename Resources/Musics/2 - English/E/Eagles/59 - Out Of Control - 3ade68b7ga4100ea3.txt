OUT OF CONTROL

Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious 
With the stars all shinin' down 
Well, I can hear the night wind howlin' 
It's a high and lonesome sound 
And I ain't had a woman in so long 
I can't feed my starvin soul 
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town 
We're gonna get a little out of control 

There's a card game in the corner 
And the barmaid smiled at me 
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and 
she brought me a drink for free 

All the town-folk call her the cheap one 
And the gamblers call her Flo 
Come on, set 'em up again 
I got me a friend and I think I'm gettin' out of control 
Oh,oh,oh 

She's cool water, her momma taught her 
I got news, she's mine and mine alone 
And if anybody's lookin' for trouble 
You know I'm the one you want to try 

Well, I'll fight any man who wants to 
And I don't care who or why 

You got to gamble on your story 
You got no guts, you get no glory 
And I'm bettin' my money on an ace in the hole
