THE SAD CAFÃ‰

Out in the shiny night, the rain 
was softly falling 
The tracks that ran down the boulevard had 
all been washed away 

Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
And I remember the times we spent 
inside the Sad Cafe 

Oh, it seemed like a holy place, 
protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the 
things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world 
with words like "love" and "freedom" 
We were part of the lonely crowd 
Inside the Sad Cafe 

Oh, expecting to fly, 
we would meet on that beautiful shore in the 
sweet by and by 

Some of their dreams came true, 
some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind 
inside the Sad Cafe. 

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, 
and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some 
and let's the rest go free 

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, 
if they ever change at all 
There's no use in asking why, 
it just turned out that way 
So meet me at midnight baby 
inside the Sad Cafe. 
Why don't you meet me at midnight baby,
