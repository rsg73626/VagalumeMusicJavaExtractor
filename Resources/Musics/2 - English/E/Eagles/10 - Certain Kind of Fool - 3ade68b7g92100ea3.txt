CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL

He was a poor boy, raised in a small family 
He kinda had a craving for somethin' no one else could see 
They say that he was crazy, 
The kind that no lady should meet 
He ran out to the city and wandered around in the street 
He wants to dance, oh yeah, 
He wants to sing, oh yeah, 
He wants to see the lights a flashin' and listen 
to the thunder ring 

He saw it in a window 
The mark of a new kind of man 
He kinda liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand 
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest 
And then one day he felt if, 
He knew he could stand with the best 

They got respect, oh yeah, 
He wants the same, oh yeah, 
And it's a certain kind of fool who 
Like to hear the sound of his own name 
Oo... 

A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man 
He had a reputation spreading like fire throught the land 
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't star t that way
