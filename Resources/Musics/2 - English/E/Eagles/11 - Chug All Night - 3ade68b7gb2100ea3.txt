CHUG ALL NIGHT

You scare me a bit, 
but that's all right 
you know when I want you 
most every night 
And I've been meaning to tell 
you baby that it makes no sense 
still I'm finally convinced 
yeah yeah 
I believe we could chug all night 
I believe we could hug all night 
The band is loose and the groove 
is right you're so much woman I 
believe we could chug all night 
On the day that I die, well 
I just might scream 
If I'm alive in the morning 
Ill be alive in a dream 
You better listen to me baby 
Cause you know that I'm hung on you 
till I'm blind and black and blue 
No one else will do 
I do believe we chug all night 
I believe we could hug all night 
The band is loose and the groove is right 
You're so much woman I believe 
we could chug all night 
No woman ever do what you do 
High on a pleasure wheel 
No devil ever cast a voodoo 
so long and dark and real 
We're gonna do a little chugging 
We're gonna do a little hugging 
The band is loose and the groove is right 
I'm wired for sound 
Are you wired for light? 
And you're so much woman, 
I believe we could chug all night 
I said a yeah yeah yeah 
yeah yeah 
Woo! It's only midnight baby
