TRY AND LOVE AGAIN

When you're out there on your own
where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
you were lost until you found out
what it all comes down to

One by one
the lonely feelings come
Day by day
they slowly fade away

Oh the look was in her eyes
you never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
and the moves she made so fine
like the music that surrounds her

Should I stay or go?
I really want to know
Would I loose or win
if I try and love again?

Ooohh gonna try and love again
Ooohh I'm gonna try and love again
Ooohh gonna try and love
 
Right or wrong
what's done is done
it's only moments that we borrow

But the thoughts will linger on
of the lady and her song
when the sun comes up tomorrow

Well it might take years to see
through all these tears
don't let go
When you find it you will know

Ooohh gonna try and love again
Ooohh gonna try and love again
Ooohh gonna try and love again

Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh

Sometimes lose
Sometimes win
Sometimes you need a friend

Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh

Gonna try
Gonna try
