MONKEY MAGIC

The monkey climbs up the tree,  
His tail sways as he sits.  
(nyubulleji bbamiro) The monkey  
dances disco well and sings well, too.  
 
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
 
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
 
[For all the things he could do, he's not doing much]

Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!  
Monkey monkey magic, monkey magic!
