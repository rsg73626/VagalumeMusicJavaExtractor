ISN'T IT EVENING (THE REVOLUTIONARY) (WITH DAVID BOWIE)

Some might say
Some stand in the sun
Some are blind
One puts his hand in mine
One disappears his name isn't written down

One dies on the lawn
His face turned away from it all

Isn't it evening

I forget if it's always this way
I was told it was gold to this day
I suppose it was always this way
But the memories won't quit
And they tell a story so sad

Isn't it evening

Tears running by
Shaking and terrify
Ones falling down
Nothing remains inside
Broken and cold
His faith lies upon the shore
Fading and thin
One face crushed in lavender

Isn't it evening

I forget if it's always this way
I was told it was gold to this day
I suppose it was always this way
But the memories won't quit
And they tell a story

Isn't it evening
Isn't it evening

Some are blind
One puts his hand in mine

Isn't it evening
Isn't it evening
