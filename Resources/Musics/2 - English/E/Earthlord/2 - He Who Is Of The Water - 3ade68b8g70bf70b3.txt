HE WHO IS OF THE WATER

Avast exspances
Celestial space
To exploration
And shield our race
He who is of the water
Will be the guide
To the firmer ground
With it resource lies

Past the atmosphere
To greater deep
Through the hollow darkness
During our sleep
From fathomed seas
To waded coast
Land of lofty watchers
Soon we will host

Emptied abandoned
Great deluge
Once evil wind
A land once was doomed
With our landing
We bring to with it
The branch of life
The beings gift

A new aesthetic
Of the absolute
Secret of the gods
And hidden truths
He who is of the water
Will be the guide
To the firmer ground
With it resource lies
