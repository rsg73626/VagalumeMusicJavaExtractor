GODS OF ANTIQUITY

As the atmosphere is in dismission
On whilrwinds we set on the earth mission
To save a planet from its own extinction
As been told by the Oracles prediction

Across the endless space
And through its hammered brace
Those who from heaven we
Gods of Antiquity

Genus engineered manslaves for the mining
Hybrids from the Gods in part difining
Eves to breed in the second manipulation
Divine the utterance of interpetation

Hominids lead toward creation slavemills
Fashioned in the foundries and strained without wills
