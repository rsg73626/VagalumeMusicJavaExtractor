HIRAETH

I rest my head I'm calm now
I lost my heart running around
It's all gone

There's a million reasons I've lost
And to many dreams I've forgot
It's all gone - gone

I rest my head I'm calm now
Hear my heavy breathing fade out
Gone - it's all gone now

I rest my head - Hear my heavy breathing fade out
Hear my heavy breathing fade out

Can't hardly wait - it's already to late
Beaten down - down - by the northern grey
While I'm gone - this city slowly awakes
It's all so bright - winter rain has fallen
I'll be gone - I've been running for so long
I had to leave - tonight - to make something right
