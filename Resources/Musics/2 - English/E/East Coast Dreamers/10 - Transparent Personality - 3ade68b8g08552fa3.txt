TRANSPARENT PERSONALITY

welcome back, insanity
inspiration's place is empty
make yourself at home till you get bored
here's the reality
she got what she wants
i just can't watch her flaunt it anymore

i've been here before
a place with nothing left to live for
don't pretend to make amends with me
rejection i can take
behavior i can fake
but forgiveness lacks when you don't even see

do you know what it's like
to be ripped apart from the inside
it makes you wanna run and hide
until you've made a brand new life
did you know that i tried
to push all of this aside
there's no giving in this time

i'd like to scream profanities
make you feel as off as i do
and wonder how things get worse everyday
but all that is below me
i've come to terms how things must be
this is the only way

There's no keeping score
the loss is on both sides of this war
the casualties are far beyond repair
i never could condone
when feelings led me on
now you fake like you just weren't aware

now you know what it's like
to be ripped apart from the inside
are you gonna run and hide
behind your made-up brand new life
and now i know, you never tried
to make any of this right
guess i'm movin on this time
