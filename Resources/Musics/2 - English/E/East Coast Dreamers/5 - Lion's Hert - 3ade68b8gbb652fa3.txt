LION'S HERT

was there some test you put me through
that i failed miserably
well perhaps if the ribbons were blue
then the red in your eyes could escape
and her smiles are fading
as her planet is slowing down
and hes masking frustrations
as his world continues around

Cuz theres something inside of you
its a monster that occurs
ive seen you smash your giant hands
into panes of glass for her
and dont tell me that she is fine
when her body can reset the time
when you too could finally be happy
and go back to the way you were

was there some test you put me through
that i passed with flying colors
but what good are colors
when the fly from the truth
if you saw death upon me
id sure like to think
that youd watch me as i am drowning
lend a hand as i sink
