DON'T HOLD ME TO A FRESHMAN THEORY

looking back i know you might not think 
there's a good enough explanation for what i've done, 
but there's a reason. 
and its not that i wasn't interested or didn't care how you felt. 
It's just i had too many years invested in somewhere else. 
i guess i just thought ignoring things would make everything ok. 
i was so childish then i didn't even think about you or your feelings. 
But i've grown up now and i think about everything.

i'm sorry hannah
but just look at what you have now
all because you got nothing from me
i'm happy knowing your content
so please forgive me hannah
everything happens for a reason
and going back to fix the way things went
would have the butterfly effect

three years is such a long time. i bet you're wondering why now, but it's not like i'm asking to be bestfriends or to start over. i'm just looking to clean the slate, is that so wrong? and maybe i'm a little curious to see what i missed out on? i think about that time you came to my dorm room and i played my guitar for you. that was probably the last time we were friends. i'm asking you to burry the hatchet and to let bygones be bygones. i'm asking you to forgive and to foreget. is that so wrong?

i guess i just thought ignoring things would make everything ok

i'm sorry hannah will you please forgive me
i'm happy knowing you're content
and i have no regrets of the way things went
