PICK A NUMBER

soul mates doesnt cut it
we go much farther than that
for how can i know everytime
i stare into your mind
that youre reaching for some body else
but i know that it is i
and i feel like im losing control of my best friend
but we're getting by

pick a number 1 -10
tell you all the reasons again
why nothing is as it all seems
and i will see you in my dreams
all you really have to do
is pick a 1 an 8 or 2
and my love will never run thin
so pick a number one through ten

i heard my name today
even though you werent there to say it
why do i bother explaining my love
you know it better than i do
gazing hazzy holding hands
ive played to many songs
in way to many bands
so lets end all the questions
and this will be a song to end them all

anon anon cuz now youre gone
i will always be in love with you
you will always be
i wait til dawn anon anon
