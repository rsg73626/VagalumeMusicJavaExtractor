PERFECT WAVE

i'm in so deep, i'm losing sleep
but i don't care as long as your there
your so soft but its so rough
laying here wondering
if you're thinking about me
the way i'm thinking of you

i'm falling and not just asleep but for you
don't let me if you're not going to catch me
i want so much from this and for now i'll be satisfied
with just a promise that you can at least break my fall
and i'll hold on till you let me go
to finish my fall alone

there are things that fit perfectly
and you could be that for me
i'm so lost in your eyes
and i don't care if i'm lost all my life
so hold me like you mean it
and i'll never let you go

i close my eyes i see you coming in
i start paddling with all i have
cuz i refuse to let you pass me by
something as perfect as you
deserves my best try
so i hold my breath
and i stand up strong and brave
to catch you my perfect
to catch you cuz your perfect
to catch you my perfect wave
