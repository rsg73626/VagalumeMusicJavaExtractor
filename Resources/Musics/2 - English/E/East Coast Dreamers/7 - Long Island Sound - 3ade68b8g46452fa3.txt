LONG ISLAND SOUND

there's something in the air, coming off the water, tonight
like i'm inhaling something so certain: inhale, exhale
after each wave resounds i hear another
and ripples always follow others

dont tell anyonethat i told you this
but i dont think that i will forgive you for this
and i know i wasnt the best of friends
but tell me which lie to beleive again
i know i gave this wound no chance to mend
tell me would it really matter in the end?

i'm so tired of seeing the same wavy reflection
i want the wind in my lungs so i can breathe direction
so perfect and true, so unlike you, so unlike anyone i know

if you're a sight for sore eyes then sew mine shut
if you're home sweet home, then home i'm not
let's have one last embrace for old time's sake
on second thought let's not
