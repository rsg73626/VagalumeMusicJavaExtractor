FOLLOW TROUGH

Our alter egos take it day by day
i swear its all good down i lay
we spoke our lines but there never was any play
once again the mirror boy gets in the way
perhaps my ships were a little late
when i was on the airplane

feeling empty is a piece of you
but every time i try to fill it up
you let me pass right through
i wish i could solve your puzzles and the real issue
but you are finnally mended as i am torn in two

i wish i could climb this mountain
i wish i could go back in time
there were many things that you said right to me
about this mountain that was never mine
and im sure that the view you see
is much better without me

sacrifices must be made
but this is not one of them
i know who is the better man
so after you my friend
