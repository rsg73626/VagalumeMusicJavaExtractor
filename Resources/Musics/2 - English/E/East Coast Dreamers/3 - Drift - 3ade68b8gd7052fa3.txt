DRIFT

Our hearts beat together as the air becomes harder to take in
our breaths get deeper as you long to sink your nails into my skin
your knees are soft and face is pure
tonight the lock stays off the door

so bite your lower lip and say goodbye
to a reality of natural high
and as you drift away it might be difficult to understand
but this is conversations end

temptation is the passion that will drive your soul insane
let your innocence rest as my tounge spells out your name
your gaze has held me for so long
to push me back now would be so wrong

i wish so much that silence could break out
but for now all the powerlines are down
