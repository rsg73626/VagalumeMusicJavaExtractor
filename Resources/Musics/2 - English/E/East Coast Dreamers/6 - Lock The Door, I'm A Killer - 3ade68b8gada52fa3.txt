LOCK THE DOOR, I'M A KILLER

you're the only good feeling
you're the reason i'm still breathing
before i felt you nothing felt right
now i know thati felt fine

for every action you take
my reaction's ignored
i wont let that be
my life anymore
so long sweetheart
please lock the door
you dont have to
leave the light on anymore

in the darkness i will lie
beside you one last time
no goodbyes no apologies
just forget me end the story

i wont let this be my life anymore
