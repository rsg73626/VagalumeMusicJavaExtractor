10 TO SQUARE ONE

Shes been holding me for 5 years friends but never lovers
Thinking she was was next in line only to cut it as it hanged her
And ive said im sorry so many times
That im sure they have lost all meaning

You were so beautiful
I was such an asshole
Thinking i could fool your feelings again
So know i stand here cryin
Wishing you were mine again
Knowing that its all my fault

She built a home for me in her eyes and a grave inside her stomach
If all goes well as you wish youll see my face in you by mourning/morning
And i never thought in just one kiss
That my world wouldnt change at all
