MAD DOGGIN'

[Intro: E-A-Ski]
[laughter]
Hell yeah, IMG nigga
What you ain't knowin' about this motherfuckin' click motherfucker?
We maddoggin' in this bitch, ya dig
We got motherfuckers drinkin' on the hater grade, that ain't right
My nigga Jayo in this bitch, ya dig
Look here, aiyyo, put the motherfuckin' E-A-Ski mask on nigga

[E-A-Ski]
I'm steady creepin' while other niggas be sleepin'
But fuckin' your hoes don't do nothin' but keep my beeper beepin'
Deep, in the West Side on the East Side of Oakland
maddoggin' these niggas, I got 'em cigarette smokin'
Nigga, I'll smack all upside your dreadlocks
and if you don't give the West Coast props when it hit your block
Makin' your spot, hot, still the coldest like the Face Mob
Rappin' ain't doin' shit for you nigga, don't quit your day job
Makin' them one-hitter quitters is leavin' a bitter
taste in my mouth, your shit is soggy like kitty litter
Niggas better keep my name of their breath and chew some gum or somethin'
Knockin' your ass out like "Deebo" will keep your gun from bumpin'
Cheatin' niggas like me keep the world spinnin'
Without the West Side who would the East Side be beginnin'
Now read that on my paper, left or right, West or East
Nigga, that's the way I write it and you read it when I speak it
I ain't dissin', just open up your vision
But if you diss me, I'ma have your ass distant, I'm on a mission
Nigga, fuck your fachi and your champagne bullshit
Knowin' your punk-ass ain't rich, I'm in your shit, maddoggin'

[Chorus: E-A-Ski]
Mean muggin', is how we set 'em up
All that braggin' you doin' motherfucker, yeah we (maddoggin')
All these niggas and they bitch clicks, wanna fuck with the IMG

[Jayo Felony]
Sophiscated ghetto niggas, graduate and curve swurve into a hole chicken
because you know the time is tickin', pickin' lots and slangin' rocks
to arm robberies, push my weight around, hangin' niggas off of balconeys
Spread like disease on foreign land, I command my respect from you cowards
cause you don't seem to understand, why a nigga got a gun in his hand
for any man tryin' to mean mug, pull out my strap, then he ran
Bam-damn did I get 'em, or did he get away
cause now I gots ta worry about the motherfucker all day
But I'ma fiend, for the gunplay, my nigga E-A-Ski caught him goin' down a one way
He blocked the ball, looked at me like "What's crackin'?"
I quickly threw up the block, glock start dumpin' it's on, till my heart stop pumpin'
Jumpin' the gun to get you dumped on, my hood keeps hoggin'
Got your back against the wall nigga and now we maddoggin'

[Chorus: E-A-Ski]
Mean muggin', is how we set 'em up
We got your back against the wall nigga, now we (maddoggin')
You fuck around and get your cap twisted
Fuckin' with this IMG click nigga, we (maddoggin')
Mean muggin', is how we set 'em up
I don't give a fuck what coast you from motherfucker, nigga, we (maddoggin')
Who's the first to bust a cap I thought you knew nigga
West Side for life!!

[E-A-Ski]
All that braggin' you doin', I know some niggas that'll jack you out your draws
Prison niggas that'll run up in your walls
Stank breath, nappy head, hoey-ass-niggas
Come see how much money you got, when at your phoney-ass-niggas
Maddoggin', peep plan and bout to get up in ya
And see how much that money talk continue
Fool, I'll turn your ass upside down and
shake the motherfuckin' change out your pocket, and empty out your wallet
And tell your bitch to give me fifty grand or she won't see your ass again
I got, six million ways to get that money out your hand, punk-ass-nigga
Youse a bitch with a man figure, slippin', drinkin' all that fancy liquor
Alazay and Crystal, sip it up, think that niggas' drunk now
Stick 'em up and give it up, I'm jackin' all niggas that's doin' fake flossin'
When you see me in your hood, it ain't all good, I'm maddoggin'

[Chorus: E-A-Ski]
I'll turn your ass upside down and shake the motherfuckin' change
out your pocket, and empty out your wallet, we (maddoggin')
Fuck your fachi and your champagne bullshit
knowin' your punk-ass ain't rich nigga, we (maddoggin')
I know some niggas that'll jack you out your draws
and run up in your walls nigga, they (maddoggin')
IMG NIGGA, IMG BITCH!!! IMG FOR LIFE NIGGA, we (maddoggin')

[Outro: E-A-Ski]
Hell motherfuckin' yeah
You better ask you motherfuckin' punk-ass self a question
Do you wanna see this IMG nigga or what?
Yeah, no more talk, all you buster-ass-niggas that's

You a bitch nigga, remember that nigga, YOU A BITCH-ASS-NIGGA!!!
