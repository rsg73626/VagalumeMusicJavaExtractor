BLAST IF I HAVE TO

' Blast If I Have To '
 
It ain't the niggas that act hard 
It's the niggas that be like quiet like 
It's the ones that put the slugs in your ass 
And tell your ass goodnight 
So get that nigga a marble coffin 
Cos i ain't that nigga t' fuck with 
I'm from the o so i blast often 
Motherfuckers wanna test my nuts and be like stuck 
Cos e a ski's shot some shit up 
Nigga i thought you knew that it be on 
Never leave the house without the chrome 
Nigga you can fuck around and get your life took 
Thinkin i won't squeeze this fuckin trigger 
Till these bullets stop distributin 
Cut your ass on the late-night (ride) 
Tryin ta jack my shit, but my glock is seventeen tight 
Now ya bent outta shape from the tips, no talons 
That i loaded in your ass by the gallons 
Now then, why would you fuck with a g? 
I don't slang but i throw them thangs and shoot the glock 20 
Many ain't got their ass in to the cp banner 
By a nigga that was well mannered 
Now you're in for a treat, you don't wanna meet my crew 
We blast if we have to 
Chorus: 
We blast if we have to nigga 
Don't make me have to 
Squeeze this motherfuckin millimetre 
And it don't stop 
I blast if i have to nigga 
Don't make me have to 
Squeeze this motherfuckin millimetre 
And it won't stop 
*repeat* 
Shit, i cocked a '94 beamer, strapped with the glock 
I caught a '94 misdemeanor (that's fucked up) 
They had my ass in the tank 
With nothin but motherfuckin time to sit and think (why?) 
I had my shit in the first place 
A black motherfucker in the o witta beamer is the worst place 
To be caught with the strap 
A ten thousand bail and an infrared glock i'll never get back 
Can't fight the shit so i'm down for probation, waitin 
Two years and sixty days in a locked station 
Can't fade the 6-0, so i chose the 2 
And cut it down, i talk to the youth 
Because they can't, i gotta file and some fingerprints 
All because a nigga wanna keep his motherfuckin shit 
Now ya see it ain't no love in this bitch 
Strapped on the defence, pull it only when i need it 
See these niggas wanna play me for my earned shit 
They ain't earned shit, they wanna take, i gotta empty clips 
These niggas ain't shit (i thought you knew, nigga?) 
That's why my shit stay cocked, i blast if i have to 
Chorus 
Oh,he's a mark and he's way outta pocket 
Fuckin with a nigga from the eastside o and don't think i knock him 
Fuck you and your raps cos it ain't right 
Niggas in the o yell "ski" cos the track's tight 
Motherfucker you can rap and try ta clown 
Niggas ain't fucking wit you and your wacked sound 
Who's the crew you wanna fuck with? (the infrared) 
Ai yo c, put the beam to this nigga's head 
Pcp motherfucker, you lost a few screws 
And these niggas don't know so i'm spreading the news 
Player hater got my name in his mouth 
If i shoot this 9 milli, i'm damn sure he'll wash my name out 
Closet nigga can't cuff his nuts so he talk much shit 
And be fucked when the glock hit 
I thought you knew that it be on like that 
It ain't about the biggest gat, it's who's the first to bust a cap 
These loco niggas ain't hearin me 
I give much love but have to blast if they fuck with me 
And no motherfuckin sympathy (he-huh!) 
(the chrome as real as you) i blast if i have to 
Chorus

 
E A Ski
