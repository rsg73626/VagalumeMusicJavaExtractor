COUNT ME IN

Half of my love knee deep in
Hooked on a dream that is reeling me in
Oh is this how we begin?
Flowers on fire in a black and white fence

Curtains of rain all appear
Watching the skirt of the day you disappeared
Caught like a wheel in a groove
Cranking it big but it don't want to move

Count me in
Count me in
Count me in
Count me in

The water is perfectly still
Full of the thunder but waiting until
When the lightning hits the lake
You'll know how it feels to want you and wait

Count me in
Count me in
Count me in
Count me in

Count me in
Count me in
Count me in
Count me in (Repeat)
