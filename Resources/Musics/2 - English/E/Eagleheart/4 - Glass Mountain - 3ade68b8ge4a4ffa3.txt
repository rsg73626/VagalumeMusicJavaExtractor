GLASS MOUNTAIN

Age of the void is dawning
The blind by the light will end the line
To write the epilogue of mankind

Humanity is dying
Evolution brings the lapse in time
A fall of the world that we've designed

Face the mirror of truth
There's no turning back
Too late to regret

Each day we're reaching higher
The faster we rise, the faster we fall
Awaiting the final curtain call

Proud of our perfect culture
First comes the light, night afterwards
Stone age after the nuclear war

Face the mirror of truth
We will fade to black
A world to forget

Climbing the glass mountain
Each day closer to nothing
Climbing the glass mountain
Each day we live â€“ each day we die

Fate is coming, global warming
Into black hole we are falling
Rise of oceans, no emotions
For vanity we pay

Climbing the glass mountain
Each day closer to nothing
Climbing the glass mountain
One day we'll fall - one day we'll die
