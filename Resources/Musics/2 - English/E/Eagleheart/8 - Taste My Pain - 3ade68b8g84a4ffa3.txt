TASTE MY PAIN

No matter what you do
Eden will die in cold
There is no ray of light for the lost in void

No matter what you say
It's equal to your decay
I'm not gonna live in cage of yesterday

Was sick of your lies but I'm healed

This time you cry in vain
I won't kiss the end again
How does it feel to starve and taste my pain?

I was going through hell for those years
Sick of it all, no more tears
In my eyes

Dying, dying to live again
I feel like I'm falling
Your time has come to
Taste my pain

This time you cry in vain
I won't take you back again
How does it feel to taste my pain?

Dying, dying to live again
I feel like I'm falling
Your time has come to
Taste my pain
