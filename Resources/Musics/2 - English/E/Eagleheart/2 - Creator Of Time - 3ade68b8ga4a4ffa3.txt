CREATOR OF TIME

By the moonlight we pray in the shadows
For salvation to come

I am the one to say when life is gone
Define the way the world is spinning around

What would you say if you could turn back time
To live the moments that you've only survived?

Make the damage undone
Be forever the one

But time goes on, no way to live once more
A part of a story that I told you before

Though the damage is done
We must carry on

By the moonlight we pray in the shadows
For salvation to come
Turn the seconds of darkness to sunlight
Oh creator of time

Why are we here on a quest for serenity?
Lord, won't you show us the way?
Condemned to wander in time for eternity
We go astray

Life may be understood backwards
As time goes by
But we are here to live forward
Until we die

By the moonlight we pray in the shadows
For salvation to come
Turn the seconds of darkness to sunlight
Oh creator of time

Why are we here on a quest for serenity?
Lord, won't you show us the way?
Condemned to wander in time for eternity
We go astray
