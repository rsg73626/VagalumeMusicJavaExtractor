LOST IN THE DEAD END

Welcome down in wonderland
Just consign your soul into my hands
Show me my future
I know you will not pretend

World around you's confusion
Which makes you wander astray
Left alone in delusion
Help me out of decay

Pain is gone pleasure at hand
Let the world goes down I trust my friend
I'll show you the future
So as you comprehend

World around me's illusion
Which makes me drown in the haze
Left alone in delusion
Doomed to die in the maze

I'm a grain in a desert sand
Where shadows never end
Inside of sweet wonderland
No one to take my hand
Forevermore

Solo: both/kus

See what your eyes want to see
Wandering for eternity

Whither in my paradise
For greed you have resigned yourself to devil in disguise

There's no turning back
I close my eyes
Till the end I'll pay the price

I'm a grain in a desert sand
Where shadows never end
Inside of sweet wonderland
No one to take my hand
Forevermore

I'm a grain in a desert sand
My life will never mend
Instead of sweet wonderland
I'm lost in the dead end
Forevermore
