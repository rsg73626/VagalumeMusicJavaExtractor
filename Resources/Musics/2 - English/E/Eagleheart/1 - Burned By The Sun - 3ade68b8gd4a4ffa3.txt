BURNED BY THE SUN

We have rised form darkness
Born form the ashes of past
Looking into the eyes of desire
Changing our world too fast

The colors are fading
And the nature slowly dies
Welcome in times where truth is buried by the lies

The path is unknown
Noone left to teach, noone wants to learn
Guided by the vision we are reaching the point of no return

Racing forward we are loosing ground beneath our feet
Evolving we are slowly killing everything that breaths

Straight to the sun we walk through endless desert sand
Empty and blind we'll never realize
Believe in lies we will never satisfy our thirst
One by one in this march of death we'll fall

Let stop ourselves for a while
We are on the edge of the abyss ready to fall
Turn away your eyes from the light
See the caravan of mankind burned by the sun

Racing forward we are loosing ground beneath our feet
Evolving we are slowly killing everything that breaths
Straight to the sun we walk through endless desert sand
Empty and blind we'll never realize
Believe in lies we will never satisfy out thurst
One by one in this march of death we'll fall
