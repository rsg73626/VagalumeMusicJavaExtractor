NOTHING REMAINS

Frozen by the hand of time
As winter came to rule mankind
Standing at the edge of a dream that means my world
Alone as darkness holds my fading mind

I know we've chosen to forget
All our memories since the day we've met
Oblivion rather than forgive
But still I want them to outlive

Inside
I'm hiding myself from rain
Trying to heal the pain
Until nothing remains

Seeking shelter from the one
I try to find my way to reach out for the sun

Inside
I'm hiding myself from rain
Trying to heal the pain
Until nothing remains

Inside
I'm keeping alive the flame
Save memories from vain
Until nothing remains

Now I'm lost in the labyrinth of mind
With emptiness inside

Still I want to hold you in my arms
Until the end of mine

Solo: mike/mj/both

Inside I'm hiding myself from rain
Trying to heal the pain
Until nothing remains

Inside
I'm keeping alive the flame
Save memories from vain
Until nothing remains
