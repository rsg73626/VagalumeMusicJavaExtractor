DREAMTHERAPY

Far away from downfall of human creation
I'm sailing to wonderland
Changing the course of time

Leaving the dark in the night
I paint with the light
Dream a new world

Where there's no pain
No life will be lived in vain
Where I live again

In my darkest hour I can see the future
For there is a future
Illusions â€“ my shelter to hide

Life is like a flower, fading light-forsaken
The more you live, the less you die
I dream on to follow the light

Escape away from this cry
I'm not ready to die
The shadows are rising
And I follow the light
Out of the night

Don't wake me up from my sleep
It takes away all my tears that I weep
For eternal desire

Dream away for dreaming will bring me to life
Never open my eyes again
Leaving the world of night

Drying the tears in my eyes
For death in disguise
My dreamtherapy

In my darkest hour I can see the future
For there is a future
When dream is a shelter to hide

Life is like a flower, fading light-forsaken
The more you live, the less you die
I dream on to follow the light
