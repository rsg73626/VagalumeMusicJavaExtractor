SHADES OF NOTHING

You think you rule and I obey
Aeons in void will break me
But still I'm here too strong to die
And I'm not afraid

You try so hard to break my wings
To reap my soul, kill my dreams
But pain reminds me I'm alive
I never die

From beyond my world I hear you say
You should do this, must not that
Don't give a fuck
I'm on my way

Before I die
I'll leave my pain and sorrow far behind
All now I feel is I'm alive
I used to fall but now I'm free inside
From shades of nothing on my mind

Passing the world of endless greed
Feeling your hate upon me
But hate reminds me that I iove
Flying away

I'm living in my world so hear me say
No matter what, I don't care
I'm soaring high this is my way
This is my turn

Before I die
I'll leave my pain and sorrow far behind
All now I feel is I'm alive
I used to fall but now I'm free inside
From shades of nothing on my mind

For too long I felt like an outcast
Since now I will not be disgraced
All of the sorrow that passed me
Have strenghtened my hunger to live

I know that you think I'm a madman
Wasting his time in a play
But you can't deny that you sense it
I've got so much more to say

Before I die
I'll leave my pain and sorrow far behind
All now I feel is I'm alive
I used to fall but now I'm free inside
From shades of nothing on my mind
Leave you behind
I want to live not to die
Have no tears in my eye
I keep on flying so high
