SOME SORTA LIGHT

Cause you need to know, I'm about to go
Some form of light has crept in on its own
And I don't care who he is, he cant defend
Cause I will now leave here, without you again

It's bigger than me
It's stronger than you
But faster than how it seems through

Cause I always know who he is tonight
Cause I always wait here at night
Cause I always know who it is tonight

It's bigger than me
It's stronger than you
A chance for an escape to creep through

Cause you need to know that you're leaving with me
And I need to know if it's real or its fake
Cause I saw you're look when I was walking away
And I need to know if I needed to wait

Forever for you, Cause it's bigger than me
Forever for us, Cause it seems like

I always know or try
and I've always been here this time
and I always know or try
and I've always been the sun

Forever for you
Cause it's bigger than me
Forever for us
Cause it seems like its

I always know or try
and I've always been here, beside
Cause I always know and try
And I always will, this time

This Time

Forever for you, cause it's bigger than me
but to wait for you, is forever for me
