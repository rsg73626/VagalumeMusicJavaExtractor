A MILLION MILES AN HOUR

Well I can go a million miles an hour
well I've been bored so try to drag me down into the night
but if in the morning in the sun
in the arms of a miracle
I'll come back and see where you're from

I can see the sun is on the rise
the pulse is strong, it warms you but it's you they left behind
but in the breath before you go
in the arms of a miracle
I'll come back and see where you've gone

it's starts as a battle of luck
in the end it's in the hands of a ghost
well hi-e-yah a ah
well hi-e-yah a ah

I can go a million miles an hour
but I can see the sun upon the rise
I can go a million miles an hour
I can see the solitry, the thoughts you feel are fine
but it starts as a battle of luck
well when it ends your in the hands of a ghost
lay it down yeh
