THE BOX

Take me home
I've had enough
And I'm done

All the alcohol
Is not setting well at all

The drugs wore off
All the pills have stopped
And these are the tiny hands
That rip us a part

And I've got one foot in the gate of hell
And you've got two hands hailing taxis down
And he got three years just for givin' up
And I've got nothing to complain about

I got one foot in the gate of hell
You got two hands hailing taxis down
He got three years just for givin' up
And I've got nothing to complain about

Don't give up
Even though I'll give up
Cuz this is a front
You want me now
Cuz I will be here all night
It seems if only an empty drink
Cuz this is a front
You want me now
Cuz I am lost without you

One foot in the gate of hell
You got two hands hailing taxis down
He got three years just for givin' up
And I've got nothing to complain about

And I've got one foot in the gate of hell
You got two hands pulling me around
You got three years just for givin' up
And I've got nothing to complain about

Cuz sometimes
Somewhere
Somehow
It's somewhere
It's somehow
Yeah...

I've got a sun burn from the gate of hell
You got a sore throat from always screaming help
He got three years just for givin' up
And I thought two years would've been enough

One foot in the gate of hell
You got two hands hailing taxis down
We got three years just for givin' up
Oh I've got nothing to complain about

One foot in the gate of hell
You got two hands hailing taxis down
He got three years just for givin' up
Oh I've got nothing to complain about
