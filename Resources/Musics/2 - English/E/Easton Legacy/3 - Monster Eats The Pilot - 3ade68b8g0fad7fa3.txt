MONSTER EATS THE PILOT

Bury me at sea before 
I unceremoniously drown between the sheets. 
The frigid ocean waters that surround me have cooled my torrid temperment; this tomb is free of regret.
 (We are broken).
 Caught off guard; So tragically enamoured by the touch.
 We are a pornographic wish upon a star.
 Denied, before we had the chance to reconcile our hearts. The animosity divides us.
 Here alone I'm waiting for the last time you have to call and bring me to your door.
 This is the cause for an alarm.
 And I'm at my last resort. 
Trapped inside.
 The air so thin my lungs breathe out of pride alone. Confined between the walls of this bedroom.
 We are the sole surviving embers of the fire.
 Ignite the spark left of a heart divided.
 Holding on to tattered threads. 
While you're half a world a way, still your drawing tight these tattered heartstrings. 
Half a world away and I'm clawing at the walls.
