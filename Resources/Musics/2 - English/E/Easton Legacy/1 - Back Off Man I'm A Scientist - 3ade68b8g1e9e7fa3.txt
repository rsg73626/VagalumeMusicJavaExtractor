BACK OFF MAN I'M A SCIENTIST

The floorboards shake 
I can feel it in my toes 
There's more to living than the skin we'll soon dispose, And if you don't tempt the hungry tiger With fresh meat on the bone 
You might still have a chance,
 You might still have a chance... 
My fingers shake
 The chemicals have reached the bone Life's kind of funny when the poison 
You bring home has paid the rent
 Clothed, and fed your family 
While simultaneously breaking them all down from the inside out. So desolate the place home used to lie, 
I sympathize with anyone who's still around.
 Now they've quarantined and boarded up our happy little homes I guess it's time to go.
 The floorboards shake or is it me that shakes the floor? It's getting hard to notice.
 We're side by side by another 
With cover ups under control below 
This town was built by liars upon the backs of our fathers and it turns out we were getting a bad deal we're only getting closer meanwhile we all far apart and our pleas ignored were more than a letdown. 
This town was built by liars... 

*Epilogue*
 They say there's a little town where the water went bad and the people started changing.
