THE GATHERING CLOUDS

Here are some words you can write in your diary. 
Thanks for the dosage, 
Ill call you in the morning if I can still dial.
 How pretty this sunset would be if I knew it was my last. Damn this soul and damn this body for bringing me back again. 
Can you will a heart to stop? 
I had this dream where I hear your song at my undoing;
 I have this dream where I cant feel anything but my heart beating.
 Simple phrases roll off of my tongue like a waterfall. 
Im sorry if you get swept away. 
Damn this soul and damn this body for bringing me back again. 
Can you will a heart to stop? So write this down, address it your heart. 
Avoid the consequence of dealing with your guilty conscience. 
I can taste the words as they slip away. 
I can taste the words as they slip away and fall apart.
 I had this dream where I hear your song at my undoing. 
I have this dream where I cant feel anything but my heart beating.
 And when I die I hope you know theres something I forgot to say.
 When Im gone I hope you know that this song was the death and the birth of me.
