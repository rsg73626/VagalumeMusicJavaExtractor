LOST

You cant fake it anymore. 
I caught you on the run from yourself and I put you there. Is this the prize youre fighting for?
 I kind of liked you more when you were torn and I put you back together. 
Oh no, its not fair.
 Youre trying to be somebody else thats exactly who you arent. 
Or change skins to trade stares playing hate me/blame me not; surreptitiously aligned. 
She said its only for a while, but Ive been lost before. She said youve turned so shallow 
I only recognize your face.
Weve lied so close together but were a million miles apart. The contents of the bottom of your heart have been erased. Ive loved and lost the rest that was inside you. 
Since weve hit the bottom of your heart and fall from grace, 
Ill leave and seek the words that were inside you.
 I cant take this anymore; your condescending lines about the world and the way its put together.
 Is this the price were paying for a misplaced leap of faith upon the wire with the signal lost.
 Oh no, its not fair. 
Youre trying to be somebody else thats exactly who youre not. 
Or change skins to trade stares, playing hate me/blame me not, surreptitiously aligned. 
Sympathy is a foreign concept you do not understand as Im begging your forgiveness, youre plotting retribution.
 If all I ever did was hurt you then 
Im sorry dear, but try to remember me as a friend. 
The contents of the bottom of your heart have been erased. Ive loved and lost the rest that was inside you. 
Since weve hit the bottom of your heart and fall from grace I'll leave and take the words that were inside you.
