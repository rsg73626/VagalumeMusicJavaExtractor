FATE OF THE NEO-GODS

Doubt and disbelief are the luxuries of the ignorant.
Placebo mockery intended to discredit. No longer
has meaning. Drifting closer, taking shape, through the mists,
tragedy rides forth. The last laugh is mine. Man has made the
neo-god. Man has made the neo-god. Unholy falseness infests.
The final day is upon us. How much further can things continue
when transgressors claim to be the victims.
Unresponsible for the lives they destroy. Bitterness.
A selfish focus. The special interest flight only compounds havoc.
The holistic picture stays unviewed and worsens. 
It is the reason violators
live while innocents are terminated. 
Prophecies unfold as the horrors close in around this world.
