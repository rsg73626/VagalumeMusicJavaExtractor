SITUATION DEGENERATES

The situation degenerates. Again alcohol hits the bloodstream.
Overwhelmed by the desire to feed the
desire. Inebriation numbs the brain. Nothing changes, nothing improves.
Empty bottles and empty days. The captive is pulled
deeper into an aimless maze.
Wasted time passes as the walls of the vice close in.
Dying internal organs no longer fuction.
Judgement impaired, direction lost.
Trapped in a repeating process.
Wasted time passes as the walls of the vice close in.
Dying internal organs no longer fuction.
Judgement impaired, direction lost.
Trapped in a repeating process. The painkiller
takes a life. The painkiller takes a life.
The painkiller takes a life. The painkiller takes a life.
