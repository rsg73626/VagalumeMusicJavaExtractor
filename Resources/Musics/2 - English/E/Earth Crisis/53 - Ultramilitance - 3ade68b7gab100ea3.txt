ULTRAMILITANCE

Legal channels have been exhausted. Uncruel alternatives rejected.
Awareness created and ignored. Direct
action is the last recourse. Ultramilitance. Ultramilitants.
Salvation of innocents. Intensified resistance.
Flooded by sabotage disabled whaling ships sink beneath the waves.
Strikes against roving murderers. Through destruction, innocents
persist. A rainforest seen as nothing more than an area on a map
to be stripped of resources for corporate profit.
The indigenous cultures and animals are displaced or destroyed
unless bulldozers are disabled to prevent access. Ultramilitance.
Ultramilitants. Salvation of innocents. Intensified resistance.
Forth from cages into the darkness. Mink liberated by masked
rescuers. Laws designed to protect oppressors correctly regarded as worthless.
Now this war has two sides... Ultramilitance.
Ultramilitants. Salvation of innocents.
Intensified resistance. Wreck!
