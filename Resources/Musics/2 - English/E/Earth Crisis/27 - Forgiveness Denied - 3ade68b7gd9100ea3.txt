FORGIVENESS DENIED

Forgiveness denied for the unforgiveable. Blood for blood.
The guilty must be slain. Violated,
dehumanized for a sadist freakish thrill.
Demonic evil incarnate an emissary of suffering.
Reveled in their helpless anguish again and again.
A string of shattered victims left in the wake of his sickness.
Emerge from the horror to bring it to its
end. Justice for the victim, justice for the victim.
The hammer hits, powder ignites, forgiveness denied.
Emerge from the horror to bring it to its end.
Emerge from the horror to bring it to its end.
Emerge from the horror to bring it to its end.
Emerge from the horror to bring it to its end.
