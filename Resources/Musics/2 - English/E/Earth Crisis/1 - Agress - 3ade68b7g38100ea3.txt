AGRESS

Tried to stop my progress, set a wall in my path.
Tried everything possible to make me come in last.
Wanted so hard to see me fall and to stay down.
Every time I am the one that picks myself up off the ground.

I can feel their eyes on my.
I can sense they're watching me.

Pushed past the point where all the rest expired.
I know I'll win, all will be mine in time.
Too much speed to stop the momentum now.
When I succeed it is not just my victory.

I can feel their eyes on my. (Agress upon the antagonists.)
I can sense they're watching me. (Agress upon the antagonists.)

Pushed past the point where all the rest expired.

Time is going to teach what truly matters, if they live long enough to understand it.
