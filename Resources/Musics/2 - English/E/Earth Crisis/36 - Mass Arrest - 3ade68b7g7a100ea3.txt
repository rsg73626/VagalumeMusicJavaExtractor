MASS ARREST

The course set for complete oppression, an explosive destination.
Fast forward ahead into time, technology metamorphasizing.

Beware...beware imposed serfdom.
Beware...beware inputted serfdom.

Robotics and machinery, could tip the scales of power to an elite few.
Their wealth upon wealth amassed, a post-industrial plantation enforced by a 
surveillance police state.

Police state, police state, police state.

Is the 2 A.M. and the last of the patriots all that stands between this plot's existence?
Is there an escape from the mass arrest procedure?
