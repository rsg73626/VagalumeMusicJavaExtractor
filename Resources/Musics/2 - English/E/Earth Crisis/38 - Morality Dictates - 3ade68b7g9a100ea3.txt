MORALITY DICTATES

Crowded against one another, or penned into an artifical environment.
Unbearable lonliness, separated
from their fellow creatures contact.
Individual innocent beings, each cow, sheep, pig, goat or chicken.
Viewed as a product
to processed. Raised only to be slaughtered and consumed.
Murdered victims enshrouded with false names that deny their
suffering. Beef, mutton, pork and poultry.
Creatures torn and butchered only for the petiness of the flavour of their
decaying flesh. The carnage of the slaughterhouse
is all completely unnecessary for sustenance of techonologically advanced
mankind. Constantly brainwashed from the beginning
to believe the opposite of this truth. The brutality is anacceptable. I
strive to end the exploitation. Morality dictates.
Morality dictates. Morality dictates. Morality dictates that I live vegan.
