FILTHY HANDS TO FAMISHED MOUTHS

Third world squalor, inhuman conditions. 
Death stalks the have nots through depravation.
Open sewers, polluted water, monoxide consumes the air. 
Crowded into shanty structures. Born into a nightmare.
Starvation and execution. Starvation and execution. 
Scavenging in garbage piles, emaciated, malnourished. 
Most turn away from those below
pleading for sustenance. The horrors, children suffer below poverty. 
Sickness, fear and ignorance, all needlessly.
Starvation and execution. Starvation and execution. 
Lives that deserve a chance written off as useless. 
Police death squads.
Disappearances. Shots in the night, hidden graves;
their victim's only inheritance. Discarded humanity surrounds discarded
humanity. Starvation and execution. Starvation and execution.
The murdered slaved or stole for crumbs or drugs to deaden
constant hunger. To deaden consciousness to the coldness in which they lived.
From filthy hands to famished mouths.
