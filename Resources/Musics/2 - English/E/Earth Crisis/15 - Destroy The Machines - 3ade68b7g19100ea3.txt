DESTROY THE MACHINES

Destroy the machines that kill the forests, that disfigure the earth. 
Ecotage when efforts to reason
fail and no longer have worth. 
Direct action is the only choice when wild lands are faced with destruction. Now is the time
for counter-agression. With every day that passes the assault 
on nature accelerates. For the industrial nations' excessive
ways this world they devasate. 
Every biome on every continent in under man's attack.
With everything to lose we've drawn the
line to hold them back. New bridges,
roads and dams pave the way to develop what wilderness remains. 
All must be prevented or
detroyed for the wild lands to sustain. 
Fighting to save the animals. Their freedom is our peace. 
For their habitats
preservation, for the violence against them to cease. 
Earth liberation through ecodefense. To halt the insanity of the yellow
death machines advance.
