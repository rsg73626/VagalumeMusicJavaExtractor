CLING TO THE EDGE

Pleasure at the price of madness. With delusion their minds are full.
Damned to misery are those who
succumb to temptations pull.
Their lapse of control bleeds over onto all of us.
At risk to harm as they indulge themselves.
The floor beneath crumbles into dust.
Screams of the wretched cut silent.
As they submerge into the cesspools depths. I cling
to the edge battered by the torrent of disease that rages past.
Of disease that rages past. Of disease that rages past.
Of disease that rages past. I cling, I cling to the edge.
