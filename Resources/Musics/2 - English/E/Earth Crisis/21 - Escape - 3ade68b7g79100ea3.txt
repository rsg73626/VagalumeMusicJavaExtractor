ESCAPE

Conditioned to turn away from all that was meant to be.
Programmed to be a machine locked into a chemical captivity.
Swim out into the darkness, won't return till it's accomplished.
Sanity lost in madness, obey the orders transmitted.

Obsessed to tranquilize, white light satiates.
The fury that possesses, in their hands there is no escape.

Controlled by the ones above, from afar they watch and wait.
Through the deep search and locate, lock on assault exterminate.
For the ones killed their was no hate, sent on a mission to obliterate.
Return to enemy hands, the ones who dictate my commands.

Obsessed to tranquilize, white light satiates.
The fury that possesses, in their hands there is no escape.

Break free, evade the masters, not theirs to dominate.
Overcome conditioning, realize time to escape.
Break free, evade the masters, not theirs to dominate.
Overcome conditioning, realize time to escape.
