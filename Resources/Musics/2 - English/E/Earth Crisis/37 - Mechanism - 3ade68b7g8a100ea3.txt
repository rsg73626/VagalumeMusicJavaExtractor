MECHANISM

Won't look beyond their own existence, don't understand difficult circumstances.
Only know what little they've experienced, won't waste my breath because they lack sense.
Plague of the earth, a propaganda fantasy, that never gels in the test of reality.

Infiltrated every aspect, infiltrated every aspect, mechanisms.
Infiltrated every aspect, infiltrated every aspect, inject brainwash.

Look back through the past, see the mass grave filled with corpses of the helpless slain.
Once established always ends the same, expansion expansion is the next stage of their game.
Invasion forces capture a country, occupy the territory.

Infiltrated every aspect, infiltrated every aspect, mechanisms.
Infiltrated every aspect, infiltrated every aspect, inject brainwash.

Go.

Theories in practice, demons run wild, skulls on skulls are stacked and piled.
Master creator, human nature denied, kills the incentives for the best to strive.

Infiltrated every aspect, infiltrated every aspect, mechanisms.
Infiltrated every aspect, infiltrated every aspect, inject brainwash.

Only know what little they've experienced, won't waste my breath because they lack sense.
Plague of the earth, a propaganda fantasy, that never gels in the test.
