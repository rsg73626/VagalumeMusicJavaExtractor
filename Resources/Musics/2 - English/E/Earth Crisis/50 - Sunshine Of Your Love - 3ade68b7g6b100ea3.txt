SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE

It's getting near dawn, when lights close their tired eyes. 
I'll soon be with you my love, to give
you my dawn surprise. I'll be with you darling soon. 
I'll be with you when the stars start falling. I'll be with you darling
soon. I'll be with you when the stars start falling. 
I've been waiting so long to be where I'm going, in the sunshine of your
love. I'm with you my love. The light's shining through on you. 
Yes, I'm with you my love, it's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you darling now. 
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up. 
I'll stay with you darling now. I'll stay with
you till my seas are dried up. I've been waiting so long to be 
where I'm going, in the sunshine of your love. I'm with you my
love. The light's shining through on you. Yes, I'm with you my love. 
It's the morning and just we two. I'll stay with you
darling now, I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up. 
I'll stay with you darling now, I'll stay with you till my seas
are dried up. I've been waiting so long. I've been waiting so long. 
I've been waiting so long, to be where I'm going. In the sunshine of your love.
