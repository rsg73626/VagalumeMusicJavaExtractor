CEASE TO EXIST

Doomsday befalls. Awakened by sirens, the fifteen minute warning.
ICBMs scream from their silos into the
sky. Warheads detonate over their targets.
Nuclear blasts incinirate city after city. Swept away by the shock of the
explosions humankind dies in agony.
Ash blocks the sun from penetrating the choked atmosphere.
The global temperature drops
into nuclear winter. Below, radiation poisoned air,
soil and water is all that's to be found.
By what is left of who is left
fires burn from the haze of a darkened world.
Charred skins hangs from the bones of survivors as they struggle trhough
leveled rubble. Past-gutted buildings and unburied bodies.
Hell rages on the face of the earth. All creation lays at the
mercy of madmen whose commands will cast us into world war three.
If the keys turn from the press of a switch all life as we
know it shall cease to exist. Cease to exist. Cease to exist.
Cease to exist. Cease to exist.
