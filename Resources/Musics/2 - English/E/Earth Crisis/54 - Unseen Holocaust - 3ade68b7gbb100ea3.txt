UNSEEN HOLOCAUST

Demons descended upon the lands. 
The fire of greed burned within their minds. They destroyed the paradise
that filled their eyes. From the east they swarmed to pillage, 
to populate the righteous under siege. The stream of invaders
rose into a raging flood. Now the arrow shaft lays broken 
where the grasses dripped with blood. Unavenged apparitions of the
dead walk down this trail of tears that never ends. 
Conquered by the sword, by treaties that were lies. Millions perished in
the wars for their genocide. Decimated by manifest destiny. 
Tortured and enslaved in the name of christianity. The stream
rose into a raging flood. Now the arrow shaft lays broken 
where the grasses dripped with blood. Unavenged apparitions of the
dead walk down this trail of tears that never ends. 
Manifest destiny prevails. Felled their rainforests, flood their lands.
Ancient cultures destroyed by so-called civilized man. 
The tribal peoples of today; survival is at stake. History means
nothing if nothing's learned from past mistakes. Stop the unseen holocaust.
