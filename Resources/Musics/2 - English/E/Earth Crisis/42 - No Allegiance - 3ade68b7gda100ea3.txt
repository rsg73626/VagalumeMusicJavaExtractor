NO ALLEGIANCE

There will be no allegiance with those who turn to sin. 
I have nothing but contempt for the turncoats who
give in. To regress from purity to weakness I can't allow. 
The blatant desecration of a sacred vow. Fuck the two-faced
losers. Fuck all who go untried. Fuck the evil bastards 
who still stand by their side. Fuck all who cheapened what I truly am
in others eyes. Fuck all those who bent the straight edge 
with their fucking lies. Integrity, sincerity, I choose to live
against the grain. Purged of the impurities that fester in their veins. 
No tolerance for weakness is what's allowed I say.
My decree is my law and it's here to stay. Fuck the two-faced losers. 
Fuck all who go untried. Fuck the evil bastards who still
stand by their side. Fuck all who cheapened what I truly am in others eyes. 
Fuck all those who bent the straight edge with
their fucking lies.
