PROVOKE

A fraction of a fraction sets the new rules to follow.
Bind the hands of those who resist, to gag the mouths of all the rest.

Crush the fight out of the those who persist, censor beliefs not allowed to exist.
Create a state of mass confusion, provoke a response from the trapped victim.

Last of the last of the last of the sane.
Hated and scorned for the truth that's possessed.
Last of the last of the last of the sane.
Now the most persecuted.

Created an illusion to trap the prey inside of the delusion that is forced into our minds.
The thought police are winning, infiltrating the brain, to own the soul and body is the point of their game.

Surest way to bring them down is to beat the negativity into them, watch them lock into self-destruct mode.
