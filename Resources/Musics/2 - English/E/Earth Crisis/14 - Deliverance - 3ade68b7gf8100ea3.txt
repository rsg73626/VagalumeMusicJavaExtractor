DELIVERANCE

From birth an existence of agony begins that ends with execution. 
Intetionally infected with diseases to then
try to find cures for humans. Fractured skulls, 
broken bones, scalded flesh and blinded eyes. For medical research and
cosmetic testing animals suffer and die. 
Walls conceal the tortured victims of vivisection. 
Nothing of value can be gained
for science or medicine when the price is a helpless animal's life. 
An animal becomes a subject - their pain a mere reaction.
Harmless testing alternatives ignored - they refuse 
to end their profit system. The suffering benefits mankind - the excuse
for demented scientists whose brutalization 
of the innocent denegrates humanity's existance. 
When education and peaceful
protest can't bring their liberation the strategy 
for their rescue changes into militant intervention. 
Every action has an impact.
Every life saved is a victory. 
The truth known by the caring few who wage guerilla warfare 
to end this atrocity.
Severed locks, doors wrenched from hinges,
the animals deliverance from torment and captivity.
Vivisectionists dragged into
the street and shot as flames engulf the laboratory.
Justice's hammer falls again and again until it ends when the price is a
helpless animal's life.
