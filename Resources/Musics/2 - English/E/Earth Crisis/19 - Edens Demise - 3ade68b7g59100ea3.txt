EDENS DEMISE

Poisoned tears fall from a corroding sky down to a tortured earth 
that's been left to die. The oceans
diseased, the stricken lands decay. Mankind's supremist mentality 
has set this world ablaze. Nature's plan forever altered,
animals lost to extinction. This society based on greed fuels 
the onslaught of destruction. The circle of death ends with the
instigators victimized. The means to quench a selfish 
lust brings eden's demise. Mass-murder, demonic cruelty. Absolute
fascism. To end the enslavement and slaughter, the antidote is veganism. 
Don't let your outrage for injustice end where your
selfishness begins. I have conquered through selfcontrol, 
together we can win. Respect for nature and innocent life, the end
of human over human oppression. 
A peaceful world can evolve after animal liberation. 
To persist with what is immoral is illogical. 
There's no excuse for violence against nature or 
for the innocent to be killed. I see so much sickness. The enemy
surrounds. I see so much sickness. I fear what the future holds. 
I have hope that the point of no return has not yet been
passed. These are the final moments. Sand pours from a broken hourglass.
