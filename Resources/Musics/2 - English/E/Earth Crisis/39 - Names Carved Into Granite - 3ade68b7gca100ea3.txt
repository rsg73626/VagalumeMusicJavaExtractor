NAMES CARVED INTO GRANITE

Civilians used as pawns in a demon's power games.
Buildings crumble, planes fall, blown out of
the sky. Shrapnel from a car bomb takes the lives of all who were near.
Terror tactics designed to spread disorder and fear.
Potential military targets are left untouched by the cowards
who instead kill unconnected innocents. To the level of the
antagonists. An inane futility that only compound the wrong.
Hatred that erases sense fuels rivalry into an escape of
atrocity after atrocity. Without an end.
Potential military targets are left untouched by the cowards

Civilians used as pawns in a demons power games.
Buildings crumble, planes fall, blown out of the sky.
Shrapnel from a car bomb takes the lives of all who were near.
Terror tactics designed to spread disorder and fear. The names
carved into granite are revealed as the snow is brushed away.
Fingertips trace across them. Memories are all that remain.
