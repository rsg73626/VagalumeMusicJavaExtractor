UNVANQUISHED

There's no time to waste, I won't hesitate, too heavy a toll's been paid.
Their escape attempts were just another trade realized too late.
Evaluated the cost of their lies. Now no more will be lost.
All the strength it takes on reserve within to save more than myself.
A distance waits to be crossed. It's all just begun.
Alive through straight edge.
Ten hits rain down for every step that I advance.
Smashed down again and again to rise to stand. I save my tears for the
living. I hold my rage for the last day. I save my tears for the living.
I hold my rage for the last day. A distance waits to
be crossed. It's all just begun. Alive through straight edge.
Ten hits rain down for every step that I advance.
Smashed down again and again to rise to stand unvanquished.
Ten hits rain down for every step that I advance.
Smashed down again and again
to rise to stand unvanquished.
