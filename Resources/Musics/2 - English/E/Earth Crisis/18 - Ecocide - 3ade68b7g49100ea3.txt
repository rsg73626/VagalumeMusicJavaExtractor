ECOCIDE

Silenced in the roar of the flames. 
After the screams and the dying, nothing remains. 
Desecrated, slashed, burned
to the ground. In the frenzy of greed, cries of protest are drowned. 
The earth dies - ecocide! The earth's forests laid
forever to waste. Thoughts of the future trampled in their haste. 
Corporations with their dollar sign focus ravage the amazon
like a plague of locusts. Plumes of black smoke ascend into the sky. 
A forest of beautiful creatures senselessly dies.
Smoking fields of devastation left in mankind's wake. 
With populations left to grow and greed they justify this rape.
(The power of the dollar) can't take precedence 
over the inevetable detrimental 
consequence. The time to react is long overdue,
from protest to confrontation by me and by you.
