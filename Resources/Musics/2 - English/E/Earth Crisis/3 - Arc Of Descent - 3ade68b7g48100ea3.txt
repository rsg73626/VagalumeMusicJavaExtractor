ARC OF DESCENT

Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.

Truth serum injected into the situation, so now I know.
Separated the real from the false and now I am better off than I ever was.

Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.

Standing where the ground beneath gives way.
Disappearing into the abyss.
Holding onto lies that speed descent.
They're all falling, I'm the only one who's left.

Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.
Time's up to decide, now it's time to choose a side.

Standing where the ground beneath gives way.
Disappearing into the abyss.
Holding onto lies that speed descent.
They're all falling, I'm the only one who's left.

Slow arc of descent begins, the test of time tells all.
One by one they dissolve into the dark, until the cowards are no more.
I'd rather live in a state of war than the hell of artificial peace.
Divide myself from the liars, now it's time to choose a side.

Standing where the ground beneath gives way.
Disappearing into the abyss.
Holding onto lies that speed descent.
They're all falling, I'm the only one who's left.
Standing, standing.
