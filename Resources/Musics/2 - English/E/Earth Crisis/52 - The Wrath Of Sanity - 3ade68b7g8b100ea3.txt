THE WRATH OF SANITY

Night of justice, knight of justice. 
Liberation's crusade's begun. Your laws will have no meaning past the
setting of the sun. Demons feeding off of the innocents' pain. 
Generations of oppression - one generation will break this
chain. Emancipation from the hands of the deranged. 
Vengeance for the dead, freedom for the enslaved. 
From love comes this
hatred. Feel the rage, antagonist of the helpless. 
Tormented inside a cage. I refuse to turn my back, 
I refuse to shut my eyes.
Steadfast against the deluge of evil of man's devise. 
The quest for their freedom won't cease until it's won. Reconcile
your sins or your blood will have to run. 
You have no respect for life. Violence you can understand. 
You turn to fell the pain.
Retribution, from my hand! You have no respect for life. 
Violence you can understand. You turn to fell the pain.
Retribution, from my hand! A bullet for every demon. 
Only your blood can cleanse you of your sin. Your actions proved that
you value profit over others lives. 
Images of your mutilated victims as I line you in my sight. 
The wrath of sanity
unleashed. Justice on Judgement Night.
