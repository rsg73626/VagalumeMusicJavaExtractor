HAIRTRIGGER

Can feel it sleeping deep inside my brain on hairtrigger setup.
To trip off my nerves are pulled taught as wire.

There's not one real reason for the disrespect cast down as I climb out.
Content to believe the lies, so eager to spread them on without a care.

Don't know what I've survived, don't care about the ones I've saved.
Can't deny me my due credit, can't make me the hate object.
Cannot stop me.

Won't throw myself away on a fool, declared my laws, I live by my own rules.
Time will show their antics never mattered when the walls they built up are left shattered.
