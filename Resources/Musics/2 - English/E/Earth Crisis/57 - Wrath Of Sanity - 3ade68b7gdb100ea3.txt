WRATH OF SANITY

Night of justice, knight of justice. Liberations crusades begun. 
Your laws will have no meaning past
the setting of the sun. Demons feeding off of the innocents pain. 
Generations of opression - one generation will break this
chain. Emancipation from the hands of the deranged. 
Vengeance for the dead, freedom for the enslaved. From love comes this
hatred. Feel the rage, antagonist of the helpless. 
Tormented inside a cage. I refuse to turn my back, 
I refuse to shut my
eyes. Steadfast against the deluge of evil of man's devise. 
The quest for their freedom wont't cease until it's won.
Reconcile your sins or your blood will have to run. 
You have no respect for life. Violence you can understand. You turn to
fell the pain. Retribution, from ny hand! 
You have no respect for life. Violence you can understand. 
You turn to fell the pain.
Retribution, from my hand! A bullet for every demon. 
Only your blood can cleanse you of your sin. Your actions proved
that you value profit over others lifes. 
Images of your mutilated victims as I line you in my sight. 
The wrath of sanity unleashed. Justice on Judgement Night.
