NEMESIS

Force-fed delusions from the overseer's hands.
Won't swallow a doctrine that denies the truth.
Most absorb the sickness, saturated in the vile, immersed.
The weak fall quickly to blind conformity, in line.

I turned myself into a monster to fight against the monsters of the world.
I spared myself the pain they'll suffer when it all finally comes to haunt.

The source of the collapse, is what is taught to pity.
Portray themselves as victims, they're the antagonists.
Dilute to breakdown the ones who resisted with force.
Paint their self-defense as acts of aggression to all.

I turned myself into a monster to fight against the monsters of the world.
I spared myself the pain they'll suffer when it all finally comes to haunt.

Surrounded by demons that brand me a devil, each single one thirsts for my blood.
Encircled by demons that rush from the shadows, I hold strong and repel their attack.
Surrounded by demons that brand me a devil, each single one thirsts for my blood.
Encircled by demons that rush from the shadows, I hold strong and repel their attack.

No I, I won't submit.
No I, I won't relent.

I turned myself into a monster to fight against the monsters of the world.
I spared myself the pain they'll suffer when it all finally comes to haunt.

Madness is now what is seen as normal, impulsiveness has been set unchained.
So few question what is encouraged, locked inside of the alien's cage.
