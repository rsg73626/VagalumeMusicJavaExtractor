STAND BY

There will be no compromise, no more negotiating. 
If you refuse to change, then you're guilty and must be
destroyed. Thoughts of superiority, your supremist crimes must end. 
You're a demon with blood on your hands, your death will
bring their freedom. I can't stand by and let the innocent die. 
By opressing innocent life you've lost your rights so now
your end is justified. There will be no compromise, no more negotiating. 
If you refuse to change, then you're guilty and must
be destroyed. Thoughts of superiority, your supremist crimes must end. 
You're a demon with blood on your hands, your death
will bring their freedom. I can't stand by and let the innocent die. 
By opressing innocent life you've lost your rights so
now your end is justified. Don't think that you've been given a choice. 
Your actions serve as your voice. Your selfishness
destroys the earth, so you've left us with no other choice. 
For the fetus, for the cat, for the cow, for the rat.
For innocent victims we will attack, we will attack, we will attack.
