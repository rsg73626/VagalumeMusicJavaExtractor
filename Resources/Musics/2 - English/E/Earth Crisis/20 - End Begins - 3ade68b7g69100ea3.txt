END BEGINS

The end begins around us. The signs are too clear to deny. 
As a new millennium begins once faint hoof beats
become clearer. An impassable void's creation between overlords 
and consumer drones rushes towards its completion.
The constitution's ablaze. Freakishness becomes normalcy, 
the inverse of morality. Abominations praised and met with open arms.
Rome and Babylon's rise nears its final stage. 
Conform, accept in silence or die in the mob's rage. 
Hostility generated from
above. Victims pitted against each other. 
Attention's diverted away from the actual antagonists. 
Afflict with sickness to
enforce their cure, synthetic peace carved out of madness. 
Is the stage set for the demonic tyrant's rise? More and more
technology seems geared to divide, monitor and terrorize. 
Personal freedoms surrendered. The means for self-defense given
away. Marshall law in a new empire. Caesar takes his throne. 
Contain, control, to dominate. Contain, control, exterminate.
