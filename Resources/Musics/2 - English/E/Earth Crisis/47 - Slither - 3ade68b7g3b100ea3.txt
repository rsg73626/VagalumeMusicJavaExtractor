SLITHER

Slither.

Try to slither in my soul, is to take and twist me, their only goal.
Won't let the wicked of the world have their way, seen the traps they've set, so I won't fall prey.
It's the end of this era in time, no respect for life, it's all crossed the line.
Human wolves slowly train the human cows to repress instinct and run into their mouths.

Slither, can't deny it's real.
Slither, can't deny it's real.
Resist mind control.

Something sinister behind the scenes, formulas for suppression pushed into brains.
Sheeple accept without questioning, reactionaries swallow the whole thing.
Won't be rendered defenseless to the predators, won't be left without the modern equalizer to deter.
Criminals hell bent to victimize, there's a lawless law out to brutalize.

Slither, can't deny it's real.
Slither, can't deny it's real.
Resist mind control.

Ten thousand eyes follow from above and from below.
Categorizing all to find the ones to push against the wall.

Stand up or die, while there's still time, while there's still time, while there's still time.
There is no reason the law abiding should not possess the means to defend themselves.
Resist mind control
