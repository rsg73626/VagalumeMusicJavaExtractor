INTO THE FRAY

Cut to pierce and flood, held it back as long as I could.
Coldness spreads within me now. Crushing in and
smashing down. Crushing in and smashing down.
Grab for myself or endure a living death.
Into the fray with pure commitment.
I must, I will. Despite all odds, despite the obstacles.

Coldness spreads within me now. I must, I will.
