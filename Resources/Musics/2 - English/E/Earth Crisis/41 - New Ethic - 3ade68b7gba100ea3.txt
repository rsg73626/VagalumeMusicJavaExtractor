NEW ETHIC

This is the new ethic. 
Animals' lives are their own and must be given respect. 
Reject the anthropocentric
falsehood that maintains the oppressive hierarchy of mankind 
over the animals. It's time to set them free. Their lives
reduced to biomachines in the factory, farm and laboratory. 
Dairy, eggs and meat, fur, suede, wool, leather are the end
products of torture, confinement and murder. 
I abjure their use out of reverence for all innocent life. 
Wildlifes' right to
live in peace in their natural environment 
without this civilization's interference can no longer be denied. 
Must no longer be denied. 
To make a civilization worthy of the word civilized the cruelty must end, 
starting within or own lives. Reject the
anthropocentric falsehood that maintains the oppressive hierarchy 
of mankind over the animals. It's time to set them free.
Veganism is the essence of compassion and peaceful living. 
The animals are not ours to abuse or dominate. I abjure their use
out of reverence ... I abjure their use out of reverence ... 
I abjure their use out of reverence for all innocent life.
