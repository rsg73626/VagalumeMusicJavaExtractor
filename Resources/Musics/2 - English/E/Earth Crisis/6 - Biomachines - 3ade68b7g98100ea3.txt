BIOMACHINES

Dawn of the biomachines.

Experiments to spawn the new breed of half living creatures to butcher for organs.
Transplants extend another's life span, re-created, twisted in neo-god's hands.
Animals physiologically altered to increase their output for human usage.
Left immobile as designed, trapped in a tortuous unexistence.

Monstrosities brought into being.
Behind the walls of laboratories, crimes go unseen.

Dawn of the biomachines.

Horrific cruelty inflicted, demons in white coats leer down on their prey.
Trapped in a hell on earth that's unknown - not heard not seen: until death they'll stay.
Helpless beings brutalized by madmen, trained to deny that they're even alive.
The basic motive financial gain, profit estimates drown the cries of pain.

Monstrosities brought into being.
Behind the walls of laboratories, crimes go unseen.

Medical Research, subjects aren't even seen as alive.
Behold the dawn, behold the dawn
Behold the dawn, behold the dawn
Behold the dawn, behold the dawn
Behold the dawn of the biomachines.

Monstrosities brought into being.
Behind the walls of laboratories, crimes go unseen.
