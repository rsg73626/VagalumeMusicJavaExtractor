GOMORRAH'S SEASON

From the core of my being comes this promise to myself
that I won't break my honor before all. 
A one-way mission through life, I won't change my course.
There's far too much to experience and accomplish to waste a precious
second drunk or hazed. An effective revolutionairy through 
the clarity of mind that I've attained. I see it all for what it
is as Gommorah's Season Ends in the grave. 
So many have become demoralized that now a change must be forced 
or all will perish in the lunacy once it befalls.
Parasites gnaw at the basis, their vulgar ways bring pointless ends.
Perpetuating the degeneration.
In this self is all I need with this oath that keeps me free.
To this I am forever true. I am straight edge.
I am straight edge. I am straight edge. I am straight edge.
