FORTRESS

Encircled. Sodom's children on every side. 
Feeding their selfishness with no regard for the pain that their
actions bring. Forked tounges spill promises 
of release through submission through carnal thoughts. 
Their greed or a drug
induced deadened state. Pain awaits the fools who fall prey to the lies. 
Time melts their false idols into pools of worthless
lead. Exhume myself from the wreckage to drag my body free. 
Crawling through the ashes as their profane creation collapses in
upon itself. Unscatched. I have not partaken. 
The X symbolizes my lifetime committment to live free from their poisons. 
I've built myself to last. 
Fortress. Time melts their false idols into pools of worthless lead. 
Encircled. Sodom's children on every side.
Feeding their selfishness 
with no regard for the pain that their actions bring.
