ONE AGAINST ALL

Instinct, survivalism. One against all, against one.
The living now envy those who perished in ruins.
The brutal live on in competition. Death's masterpiece nears its completion.
Left in the aftermath. World War Four, survivalism.
One against all, against one. The living now envy.
Those who...those who perished. Adapt to the harshness or become one with
the dust. You adapt to the harshness.
Adapt to the harshness or you'll become one with the dust.
Adapt to the harshness or you'll become one with the dust.
Adapt to the harshness or become one with the dust.
Adapt to the harshness or become one against all.
Armies of the world clashed against each other as it had been prophesied.
Severed heads, adorned pikes stark against the barren land.
The horror of all horrors when the warheads detonate.
Will this be mankind's fate brought by hi-tech
barbarians. The law of lead now reigns...
