FIRESTORM

Street by street. Block by block. Taking it all back.
The youth immersed in poison - turn the tide counterattack.
Violence against violence, let the roundups begin.
A firestorm to purify the bane that society drowns in. No mercy, no
exceptions, a declaration of total war.
The innocent's defense is the reason it's waged for.
Born addicted, beaten and
neglected. Families torn apart, destroyed and abandoned.
Children sell their bodies, from their high they fall to drown.
Demons crazed by greed cut bystanders down.
A chemically tainted welfare generation.
Abslolute complete moral degeneration.
Born addicted, beaten and neglected. Families torn apart,
destroyed and abandoned. Children sell their bodies, from their high
they fall to drown. Demons crazed by greed. Cut bystanders down.
Corrupt politicans, corrupt enforcement, drug lords and
dealers, all must fall. The helpless are crying out.
We have risen to their call. A firestorm to purify.
