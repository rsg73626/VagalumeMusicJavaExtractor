BROKEN FOUNDATION

Pain. Bashed to the floor. Ugly, inferior, helpless and worthless. 
A low self-image has been made. It's
continously reinforced. Barbed words that never leave the mind echo 
and cripple from the inside. Wounds of selfdoubt bleed
fear and tension. Built to fall from a broken foundation. 
Begging for forgiveness when no real wrong has been committed.
Just to try to calm the rage before it degenerates into violence. 
There's no refuge. In what should be the refuge when the wrong
words ignite anger. There's no refuge. 
In what should be the refuge when the wrong words ignite anger 
into frustration that can't be controlled.
Stumbled, fractured through years of confusion. 
Now the direction's set. Your potential is finally
realized. Rising as the embedded harm is slowly overcome. 
Bashed to the floor. Ugly, inferior, helpless and worthless.
A low selfimage has been made. It's continously reinforced. 
Barbed words that never leave the mind, echo and cripple from the
inside. Arise and build anew. Express release. Seize control.
Express release. Reinvent. Arise and build anew.
