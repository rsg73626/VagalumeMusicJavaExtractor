of a nigga with street wise reality

I stare back death right in the face 
contemplate my last day on and everyday base

I hope it only takes one shot
cause I don't wanna die slow
my funeral will be full of my peers
people that neva gave a fuck about me droppin'

I hope I'm in the casket face down
so all you muthaphukkaz can kiss my black ass now
and fuck all that cryin' all night
just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life

I give a shout to Tonel and the Ruthless Phuckin Family.
