REAL THUGZ

[Eazy-E]

Aw yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track jump back
Strapped with a fat buudah sack and a 7-8 'Lac
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt and a fly-big Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow 
Givin love to them playaz that I know is real g's

[2Pac]

Mobbin' like a motherfucker stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window gettin' fucked off - liquor
Get loaded can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack
keep your dough fat

[Eazy-E]

Or you might get what we call the rat pack
I gives a damn about a skanless trick
let me hit it one time and trick that sick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no fo
That's how it is, I got no love for ya

[2Pac]

And jealous muthafuckas can't see
That it's the fame that caught these stupid bitches, pass the pussy free
So tell me why u sweatin' a muthafucka like me?
A young nigga tryin' to a hustle up some G's
You pussy ass playa hatin' hoes speakin' down on niggas
Jumpin' around at the shows
And your the first muthafucka to jump
To the trunk when it's time for fun
Little trick ass punk

[Eazy-E]

Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sicknes s
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real playa named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk fools payin me
And broke groupies and hootchies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but i tell it like it straight-up is
Before you do a record, partner, handle your business

[2Pac]

And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce and bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt
And now im in the rap game like the crack game
I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Plus, shots at my adversaries
Dem niggaz scary best it's time to be buried
Cause ill be buckin' in a fuckin hurry

[Ice Cube]

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us (you know)
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs 
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us 

[Outro]
Every hood's the same {x2}
Stop trippin on me
Every hood's the same(x2)
