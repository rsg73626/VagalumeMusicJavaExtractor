[Female: We're sitting here with Eazy E]
Believe that
[Female: How are you doing ?]
Allright
[Female: So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?]

Verse One:
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin, I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin up
Makin sure no punks are runnin up
[Eazy E: Because I'm a gangster havin fun]
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin thru Compton
Turbo, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang so undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, Mac Daddy, lookin for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six fo' Impala
Rollin', and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know, you can't judge a thief
or thug, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
[Female: Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping ?]
Hell no! Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me:
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So... you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

[Female: Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent ?]
Sometimes
[Female: Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called "gank"
somebody ?]

Verse Two:
Wait... for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then... all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin
Shht, I think somebody's comin
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Off the wall... don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So... is there any more questions?

[Female: Yes, as a matter of fact, there is...
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up ?]

You mean a 211 ?

[Female: Yeah]

Verse Three:
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task:
Go in broke, come out with cash
[Female: Were you slick ?]
Yeah, you gotta be cunning
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: "This is a robbery"
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to protect his femina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: "Punch it"
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
[Female: Is all that true ?]
I don't lie
You see... I'm not mister nice guy

[Female: Oh, so you're not exactly a role model ?]
Not exactly
[Female: And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself ?]

Outro:
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so (??)
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N-W-A and Eazy E
One more, before we end this session
[Female: What's your real name ?]
No more questions !
