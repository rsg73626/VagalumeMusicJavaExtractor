"N.W.A. Niggaz With Attitudes, we're underground reporters we tell about,
you know, the streets and everything that goes on, you know, around in Compton,
our area, what's going around around us, we don't know what the fuck's going
around around by YOU, but frankly we don't give a fuck, you know. Most kids
in Compton don't give a fuck who the mayor or the president is you know they're
not even interested in votin'. And the police, you know what I'm sayin?
