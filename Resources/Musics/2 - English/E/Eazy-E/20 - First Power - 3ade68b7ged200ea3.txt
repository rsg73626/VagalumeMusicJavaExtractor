FIRST POWER

"I am the ressurection and the life. He who believes in me, though he
dies, yet shall relive, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never
die...(shutup, bitch). Fear not them which kill the body, rather fear Him
which is able to destroy both body and soul in Hell. Get thee behind me
Satan and push me along." 

"All this power I will give thee, if thou therefore wilt worship me.
All shall be thine..." 

"Come with me bitch as we go through the door, backwards. Heaven in art
which Father our, Our Father which art in Heaven...(hey muthaphukka!)
