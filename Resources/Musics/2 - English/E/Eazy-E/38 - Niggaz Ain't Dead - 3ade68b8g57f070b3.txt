NIGGAZ AIN'T DEAD

[Eazy-E]
Now everythings good in my hood
And it's on and poppin' Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
From East Side South Compton
Str8 givin' up the real
On how a nigga feel talk that shit
Muthaphukkaz caps get peeled
Layin' low in the cut
Gettin higher than a muthaphuka niggaz knows what's up
I'm that gangsta, gangsta is that what there still yellin'
Nigga G to a T saggin' and bailin'
Live by the gun you know what I'm sayin' Ren
"Yea"
So I guess I'll die by that muthaphukka then
So when I die niggaz bury me
Make sure my shit reads Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
And it's a fact to be exact my tombstone should read
He Put Compton On That Map
And that's how a nigga feel
When I'm givin' up Tha Muthaphukkin Real

[Chorus:]

[B. G. Knocc Out]
They say real niggaz was dead but this nigga be alive
[Mc Ren]
Eazy muthaphukkin E
muthaphukkin god father of gangsta gangsta
[B. G. Knocc Out]
They say real niggaz was dead but this nigga be alive
[Eazy-E]
Well I'm Eazy-E I got womaan galore (x2)
