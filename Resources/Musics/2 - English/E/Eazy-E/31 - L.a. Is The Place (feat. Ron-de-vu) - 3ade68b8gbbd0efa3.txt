L.A. IS THE PLACE (FEAT. RON-DE-VU)

L (repeated)
LA is the place
I'm not a renegade but you wish I was
Just because I like to hang with boys in the hood
Live in LA always chill on the west coast
A tilly mogul got it close just I mean to boast
I said wassup we?ll be who riding on you
Nick name easy E and I?m down with the crew
Come talking that trash
We'll bore(burn) your car
He let the brun(k) (It's not the Bronx?)
It's LA
But just as hard
Don't get me wrong I like to brag on the city I own
Subway RTD don't ride it alone
You might have silly thoughts
That were insane
But the city I'm from
Let me explain
In LA there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that were too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off
One two, its time to get L
LA Cal I forn ia (3x)
City of angels .. Hollywood
We love it
I turned you on to the best females in the world
I wish they all could be California girls
Like the east where your girls wear too many coats
Bring your clothesie
Runny noiseie
With a sore throat
that the girls in the south I cannot bust
Because the girls are fly and down with us
In the valley not the alley
Is pina not valley
Easy-E that's me
Always chip and fally
Hollywood's a bit of beef
Where the scene is raw
Oh yea the strip is a trip on
South Crenshaw (?)
Don't get me wrong I like to brag on the city I own
Boy you walk do what?
Don't walk alone
because
In LA there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that were too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off
L (repeated)
LA is the place
Build with the brother who build the old school
Ge'll ge'll get a lill stuff of that BEAT BOX ( get get get a little stuff of that beat box)
West coast style from LA
Yes I gets mine, It's got to be that way
It's sunny California that's where I be
If you forgot homeboy I chill with E
In the west I stand that's where you fall
Fell it where a punk goes snatching it all
Rhyme by rhyme record by E
In the city of L
With a devil like me
She's contaminated where the boys are hard
And people like me don't perpetrate the fraud
You wanna mess around
You better get wise
We'll find your but
And cut you down to size
because
In LA there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that were too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off
LA Cal I forn ia (3x)
City of angels .. Hollywood
We love it
because
In LA there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that were too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off
