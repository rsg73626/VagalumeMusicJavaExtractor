SOUND OF THE UNDERGROUND

Disco Dancing With the lights down low
Beats da pumping on my stereo
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall
Im saying crank the base I got 2 get some more

Water is running in the wrong direction
Got a feeling its a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflections
Something funny is going on inside my mind

I dont know what but its pushing me higher
Its the static in the floor below
And then it drops and catch like fire
Its the sound that
Its the sound that

Its the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
In to the over flow
When the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
When the base light jumps to the back street night
The beat goes round and round
Its the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

Chain reaction running through my veins
Pumps the base right on up till my brain
Scroll my minds until I lose control
And when Im building blocks its got my soul

Water is running in the wrong direction
Got a feeling its a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflections
Something funny is going on inside my mind

I dont know what but its pushing me higher
Its the static in the floor below
And then it drops and catch like fire
Its the sound that
Its the sound that

Its the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
In to the over flow
When the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
When the base light jumps to the back street night
The beat goes round and round
Its the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

I dont know what but its pushing me higher
Its the static in the floor below
