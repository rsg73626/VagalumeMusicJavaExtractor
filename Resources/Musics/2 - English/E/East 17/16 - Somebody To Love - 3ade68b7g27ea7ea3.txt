SOMEBODY TO LOVE

Chorus:

We all need someone to love
We all need somebody to love
Holding and kissing you
When you go missing you
Keeping you warm through cold of the night
We all need somebody to love
First thing in the morning
When you just arose
Your eyes still closed
You're getting up, you're feeling down
Maybe it's 'cause
Your bed's creased on one side
You can't hide your face
From smiling
While your heart
Wears a frown
You always move on
No place to call home, living alone
Why should it have to be this way

Chorus

You run and you hide
While you're hurting inside
From memories
You can't get away
From the pain in your heart
Toss an you turn
You've seen all
Your own burn
Was a childhood dream
Can't keep it together
While your world falls apart
You're just like them
But they don't agree
Living alone
Why does it have to be this way

Chorus

Holding and kissing you
When you go missing you
Keeping you warm through cold of the night
And to be your companion
Of soul understanding
Your every need to be your light
