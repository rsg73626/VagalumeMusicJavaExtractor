WEST END GIRLS

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing to your head.
You think you're mad
that you're unstable.
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town.
Call the police
there's a mad man around
Running down underground to a dive bear in a West End town.
In a West End town a dead end world -
The East End boys and West End girls -
In a West End town a dead end world -
The East End boys and West End girls -
West End girls - West End girls.
Too many shadows
whispering voices
Faces on posters
too many choices.
If - when - why - what
how much have you got?
Have you got it
do you get it? If so
how often?
Which did you choose
the hard or soft option?
Which did you choose which did you choose.
In a West End town ...
You got a heart of glass
Or a heart of stone
Heart of glass or heart of stone
Heart of glass or heart of stone
In a West End Town ...
You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'till get you home.
I've got no future
we've got no past
Here today
built to last
in every city and every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station.
How far have you been
How much have you seen
In a West End town ...
In a West End Town in a dead end world
