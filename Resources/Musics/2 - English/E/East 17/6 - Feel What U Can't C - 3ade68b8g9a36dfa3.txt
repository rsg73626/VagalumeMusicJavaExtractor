FEEL WHAT U CAN'T C

Feel what you can't see
Feel what you can't see
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sitting on your bed
Tears roll alone
I hear your tears
They tell your heart needs a home
Someone to love
Who loves to hug
Someone gentle and warm like a rug
Like a rug I'll hug your heart
Tight close to mine
They'll sentance me to death
If stimulation's a crime
I'm gonna love you
Grind and hug you
Real slow and deep
Take you to the world my girl
Where fantasies meet
So before your next tear falls
And love seems far
Rest upon my chest
And I'll divide my heart

Purely feelings
No pills no potions
Do you really know
What real love is
Do you really care
It is what is in your heart
And not just what is in your hair
Feel what you can't see
Let the love inside you glow
Feel what you can't see
That is what it's all about
Let the love inside you glow

Love ain't just a name or game
But a reason
Reason for creation
Reason for season
Like the cloud ride upon the shoulders of the sea
There's a ticket in my pocket
Take it and ride with me
I'll be your pillow
On me sleep at night, right
Oh, if you're scared babe
I'll hold you real tight
I'll never let you go
That's why I'm telling you so
Give love chance to grow
To come inside and flow

Purely feelings
No pills no potions
Purely feelings
No pills no potions
Do you really know what love is
Do you really care
It is what is in your heart
And not just what is in your hair

*Feel what you can't see
(Can you feel it, can you feel it)
That is what it's all about
(Can you feel it)
Let the love inside you glow
(Can you feel it, can you feel it)
Let the love inside you glow

(Can you feel it)
Repeat * x 6
