AROUND THE WORLD

Yeah
Oh
Been Around The World
Been Around The World

Seen The Seas Seven Sailed Across Them All
Seen The Moon Rise Over Paris
 And I Watched Her Gently Fall

On To The Beat
Keep Moving Never Stopping
Though Sometimes
I Feel Like Dropping Gotta Keep On And Be Strong
 Avoid The Wrong
Cos In This Life You Walk Alone
Through The Danger Zone Until You Get Home

Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
Oh Baby
Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
Oh Baby

Take Me Home Where My Soul Belongs

Been Above The Clouds That Paint The Sky
Stood Below The Cosmos And I Pondered On A Why

Back To The Track In Fact I'M Breaking
Through I Never Knew That You Would
Turn And Walk Away To Stay
And Leave Me Standing On My Own
Far From Me
Like A Nomad
Sad Bad

Dreams About Togetherness That We Never Had

Been Around The World But Ther'S No Place Like Home
Oh Baby
(Gotta Keep On And Be Strong)
Been Around The World But Ther'S No Place Like Home
(Until You Get Home)
Oh Baby

Take Me Home Where My Soul Belongs

Shout To The North To The South To The East To The West
To The Home I Love Best Where My Soul Can Rest
Yes

Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
Oh Baby
(To The Home I Love Best)
Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
(Gotta Be Strong And Keep On)
Oh Baby
(Where My Soul Can Rest)
Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
Oh Baby
(To The Home I Love Best)
Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
(Gotta Be Strong And Keep On)
Oh Baby (Where My Soul Can Rest)
Been Around The World
Yeah (To The Home I Love Best)
Been Around The World
Yeah (To The Home I Love Best)
Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
(Gotta Be Strong And Keep On)
Oh Baby (Where My Soul Can Rest)
Been Around The World But There'S No Place Like Home
Oh Baby
