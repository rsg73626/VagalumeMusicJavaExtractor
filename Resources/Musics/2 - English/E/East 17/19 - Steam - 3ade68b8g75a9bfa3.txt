STEAM

Steam steam steam steam
Call me for the pleasure
You can call me for the pain
Call me on the phone
Or on the metal plane
I'll be the freak you need
I contain what you came for
Come without karma
To destruct the dance floor
Rise to the top, never stop
Drop like a cream
U bring the body and I'll bring the steam
U bring the body and I'll bring the steam

Love can love you
Love can heal you
Love can see you
Love can feel you
Love can warm you (oh babe)
Love can calm you
Love will help you
Love won't harm you

Steam steam
There's no need to be afraid
Steam steam
Let the lake of love flow
Steam steam
2 night let's become one soul
Steam steam steam steam

(Keep going in)

Steam, like cream dream
Never stop rising
I'll rub ya like a wave
Going out while the tides in
Precious bubbilicious
Hard or nice n'easy
Smooth with the move to soothe
Dry or greay
Here is your harmony
Here is your friend
Kindred spirit of etheral blend
Meet me on a cloud
Go on a journey, sure
I'll take your body
On a mistery tour

Love can love you
Love can heal you
Love can see you
Love can feel you
Love can warm you (oh babe)
Love can calm you
Love will help you
Love won't harm you

Steam steam
There's no need to be afraid
Steam steam
Let the lake of love flow
Steam steam
Tonight let's become one soul
Steam steam steam steam

(Keep going in)

The clock upon your wall
Is tickin' slower and slower
Time disappears
And I go lower and lower
I know your final fantasy
But I can repeat that
Doubting about me
Bet your doubt
I'll defeat that
I'm your spiritual dancer
Your emotion enhancer
Any way you wanna go
Whether below or on top
I'll love you down
All around in and out and all about
I got your lover non stop

Steam steam
There's no need to be afraid
Steam steam
Let the lake of love flow
Steam steam
Tonight let's become one soul
Steam steam steam steam

Outside it's a raining but inside is wet
