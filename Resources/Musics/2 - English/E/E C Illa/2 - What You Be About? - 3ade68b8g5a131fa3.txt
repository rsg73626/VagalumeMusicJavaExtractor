WHAT YOU BE ABOUT?

For about as long, as I can remember
From January on, through to december 
Motherfuckers in chi town been bangin 
They had they little blocks and you could find 'em all hangin 

The year was eighty-one, del plains and broadway 
Vicelords and eagles, strappin in broad day 
I heard this braud say call the cops 
They swingin bats and chains, and they throwin rocks 

And that was as bad as it got back then 
Noone was servin blows pullin glocks or mack tens 
So I kept to myself amongst the pimpin, and hoein 
Gang population consistantly growin 

Years went by and that shit got tight 
Half my homies went left and the other half right 
Despite all the past, they heads got swoll 
And with the increasin age came the loss of control 

We all knew better, but some didnt care 
Like 'Fuck the next man ima get my fair share' 
And with that came the shootin and sellin 
and in the grade school hallways you could always hear 'em yellin 

[Chorus:]
What you be about, What you be about 
Some choose the people, some choose the folks 
What you be about, What you be about 
Some choose the people, some choose the folks 

Now age 16 came and everyone had dropped out 
And as far as beef goes, getting knocked out 
Was cool, cuz you coulda got shanked, or blasted 
In Chi town the gangbangin art had been mastered 

At last it was just too far gone 
The year was eighty-nine and it wouldnt be long 
Till shit got as bad as it could get 
Cuz wit no conscience, theres no regret 

False flaggin techniques, were bein perfected 
And fist to fist combat had long been neglected 
Infected by the plague, of crazy ass shortys 
Doin more dirt than men in their 30's and 40's 

The more these kids did, the more they wanted to do 
And if you got to catch a slug hope that its a twenty-two 
Cuz survivin nowadays is a task 
So you best know what to tell them when they ask 

[Chorus]

Now the present day is in effect and I cant walk down the street 
Without some type of shit to put walks in retreat 
Cuz these sets got the addicts acting dramatic 
And in the summer time its even more sparatic 

Cuz heat makes marks straight tameless 
And all things considered, shits gettin outrageous 
New sets poppin up like everyother day 
Motherfuckers claimin shit cuz they know no other way 

Sayin either flip this sighn, or hear a poppin sound 
Im like I cant throw it up let alone throw it down 
I done lost track on whos who and whats what 
So to simplify shit I be layin in the cut 

While my homies out there raisin hell cappin shit 
Im creatin it my best wit this rappin shit 
But if you think that you can hide then you dreamin 
Cuz just chillin in my crib I can still hear 'em screamin 

[Chorus]
