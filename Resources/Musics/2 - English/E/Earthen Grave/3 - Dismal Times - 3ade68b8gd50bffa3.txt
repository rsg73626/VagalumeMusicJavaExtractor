DISMAL TIMES

Fire's high pitch fork
Gravel pit dark hole
See the light fade away
Live for another day
Cold steel in my hands
See the light fade away
Moving through the rock and soil I see your face
Screaming souls echo
From the sea of sinners
See the light fade away
Dismal times here again
Feel the freeze changing
See the light fade away
My love is lost
In these dismal times
My life is lost
In these dismal times
Calling out
To my lord
Will you save me again
Reaching out
To my lord
Can you save me again
Can you save me again
Wading through these dismal times...
