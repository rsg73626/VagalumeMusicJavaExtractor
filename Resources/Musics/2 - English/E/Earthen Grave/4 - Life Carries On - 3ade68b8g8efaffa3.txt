LIFE CARRIES ON

See his dying eyes as he falling down
World of doom in his mind as he cries out loud
Licks his wounds to the bone
Never more
Looking up to the skies blood is cold shadows run inside
I carry on
I walk the storm
I carry on until my end
I carry on
I walk alone
I carry on until my last breath
Sword of pain has the blood of the wounded souls
Liars' eyes hide the truth never to be told
Desert winds blowing high in the dead of night
Counts his gold and his days before he dies
I carry on
I walk the storm
I carry on until my end
I carry on
I walk alone
I carry on until my last breath...
