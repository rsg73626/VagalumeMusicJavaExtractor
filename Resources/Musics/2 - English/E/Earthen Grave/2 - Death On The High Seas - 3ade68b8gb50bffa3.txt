DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS

Feel the cold wind blowing in
Freeze my hands & skin
Skies burning red
Viking yell I roar
Will this be my end
Or just the start of the beginning
In the shores of sin wash off all my love
I must have godspeed
Oh, here it comes
Steel rain coming down again
Oh, here she blows
Steel rain coming down again
Never turn you back
Don't close your eyes
Before the tide washes you away
Been so long since I've held you
I pray that I live another day
I see the storm ahead
The shores of sin wash off all of my love
I must have godspeed
Oh, here it comes
Steel rain coming down again
Oh, here she blows
Steel rain coming down again
On the sea for so long
Don't know which way is home
Everyday seems the same
Wish I could make it home
See the sky turning red
Hear the thunder ahead
Count my days to the end
As I head into the core
See the grand mountains fall
Crumble away
See the moon brighten the skies
We scream for our lives
The dragon whips his tail
We all drown again
The grand mountain falls
We crumble away
Death on the high seas
Destruction to my mind
The vision is burnt
The soul of the storm is gone
Never to return
My fire that burned is gone
The serpent has won
The dragon whips his tail
We fall to the end
Death on the high seas
