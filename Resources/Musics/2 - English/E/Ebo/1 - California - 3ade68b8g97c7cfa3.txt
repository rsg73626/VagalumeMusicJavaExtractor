CALIFORNIA

The perfect cut
The perfect shirt
Snakeskin boots with no one
to show to
Too much cologne he leaves his home and on his hip he wears a phone to call you
What's your name and what's your sign?
He checks his breath another time
He calls himself up on the phone so he doesn't seem alone
He dances cool yet looks absurd
He sings and doesn't know the words
The black soles of his shoes he says he bought in California
But you don't have a clue
He studs up to the bar
I guess I could've tried to warn you
He buys a drink and you accept
He pays your tab and doesn't tip me
That's uncool
I'm closing out he closed the deal
I see you walking out the door
with that fool
What's your name and what's your sign?
He checks his breath another time
He calls himself up on the phone so he doesn't seem alone
He dances cool yet looks absurd
He sings and doesn't know the words

Chorus:

The black soles of his shoes he says he bought in California
But you don't have a clue
He starts up to the bar
I guess I could have tried to warn you
If you had a clue
His self esteem is so thin - it's thin enough that you can see through
but you don't have a clue
He goes back to his friends - I bet he tells them that he boned you
I see you, seeing right through me
I see you seeing right through me
I see you seeing right through me

Chorus
