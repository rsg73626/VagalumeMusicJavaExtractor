RAIN SONG

Now please believe in me
If I offer change of scenery
The necklace that I gave last Spring
hangs up above
I squeeze across a crowded room
I met you there one afternoon
Now years have past a crescent moon
Hangs up Above
Hangs up Above
Hangs up Above me

Chorus:

I'm holding out until the rain is gone
Everything
I gave in, I gave out
was put up with then I was put down
I cursed it all when the pain was strong
I gave in, I gave out
was put up with then I was put down

I'm Not so sure you know
the pieces fell like Dominoes
By a breeze that blew once long ago from up above
Now please believe in me if I offer change of scenery
The necklace that I gave last Spring
hangs up above
hangs up above
hangs up above me

Chorus
