EVER AGAIN

Resign to post a hollow ensign in regards to days of old
Progress or a lack thereof, confess turning to face the untrue
A passage new, a passage bold
Wayfaring a path one may never undo

Re-paving the ways, long forsaken
Adversities never forgot
Re-righting the wrongs that have always proved
Undeserving of reform

Resign to post a hollow ensign in regards to days of old
Progress or a lack thereof, confess turning to face the untrue
The time passed long ago can still alter you
Custom distain over the wake of your past

If only the mindful felt for the lost, would the error persist
If only the innocent fell for denial, once hopeful, now blind
And the light, as blinding, and yet as faint as it may be
Has lead us nowhere but to our graves, much like it does now

And with hands shaking, a prayer out loud
To guide a hand into hallowed ground
For a genesis like every one before
Pride forged, ambition in the dark
Regret is still only a spark on the
Fuel that is almost but a rhythm set to echo ever again

Trace the artery alone
And lead, in vain, your path to conceive the unknown

The time passed long ago can still alter you
Custom distain over the wake of your past
