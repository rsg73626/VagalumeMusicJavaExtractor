CONTROL

Stuck inside
A world inside my head
A place where I think too much
A place where no one can touch
My God forsaken fear
And though I don't pray enough I want to

[chorus]
I want to thank you for the tears I've cried
And hope you gave to me
I want to show you what I've kept inside
That takes control of me

Thought somtimes
I was left behind
Alone here all by myself
Forced to look at myself
I never will believe
Things they say to me

Line up the bottles to complete the grief I've held on to for so long
An angry soul I reap unto the people that have ever tried to do me wrong
