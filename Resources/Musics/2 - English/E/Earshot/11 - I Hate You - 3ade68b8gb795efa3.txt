I HATE YOU

Do you know who your enemys are?
One day they only reap what they sow.
So wake up, let me hear you, let me feel you, let's go!
Hey! woo! hey... for... hey...

You lie, you cheat, you steal, you try to tell me how I feel
I yell and scream and tell you things that you don't want to hear.
You try and try to make me think that I can touch the sky
(she likes to think I'm crazy.)

Yea! I've got a message for you, listen to me yourself.
I've got a message for you, I hate you!

Hate!

Brace yourself because we're gonna catch on. (catch on.)
And when the levee breaks, there'll be no where to run (so long)
Instead of talking all that shit you talk, why don't you come talk it to me?

I hate you!
I hate you!
I hate you!
