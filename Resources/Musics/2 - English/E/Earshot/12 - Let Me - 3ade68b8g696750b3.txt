LET ME

You are everything
You are nothing just the same
Left without warning
But that comes as no surprise

So let me hurt you
Like you hurt me
Let me wrong you like you wronged me
Let me hate you
Like I want to
Let me hurt you like you hurt me
Let me

The day is coming when
Everything but you remains
Hear me now
And when I look into your eyes

So let me hurt you
Like you hurt me
Let me wrong you like you wronged me
Let me hate you
Like I want to
Let me hurt you like you hurt me
Let me
