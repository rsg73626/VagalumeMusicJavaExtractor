HEADSTRONG

Strapped down and heavy
Tied up and bound
This weight I carry
This weight I've found
So let...me be the one to say
I've really had enough

Downfallen on
(Yes, you mean the world to me)
My sweet love
So headstrong
(Are you)
 Strong?

Watch me
Fall

One time to many
You've let me down
Won't think what could be
Can't feel much now

Downfallen on
(Yes, you mean the world to me)
My sweet love
So headstrong
(Are you?)
Strong

Watch me
Change this world inside of you
Change this world inside of you

Does it really mean that much to you
To hide your fear, to test the way I feel
To test the way I feel
To test the way I feel
To test the way I...feel

Watch me fall
Watch me break
Watch me crawl
Watch me throw it all away

Downfallen on
(Yes, you mean the world to me)
My sweet love
So headstrong
(Are you?)
Strong

I can't believe the things you say, so
Wrong for how I feel with way
I'm sleeping to relieve this strain so...
Calmly, slowly, softly, just let it all
