TONGUE-TIED

Last night I dreamt that you were dead.
The only that I could find to clear you from my head.
I find it hard for me to get past all the shit you did to me.
In spite at night I try in vain to get my mind back right.

Tongue tied 
I feel so terrified 
I'm so sick of being on my own (this feels like suicide) 
Tongue tied 
I feel so dead inside.

Some things are better left alone, completely out of sight and mind, never to be told. 
I find it harder to express the things that no one else can see. But me, sometimes I wait for days to get my mind back
right.

Tongue tied 
I feel so terrified 
I'm so sick of being on my own (this feels like suicide) 
Tongue Tied 
I feel so dead inside 
Struggling in a world I can't control (this feels like suicide)

Some say waiting
Taking my own time is all I can do
Should've known you'd things to hide by look in your eyes
I can hear the words loud
(And now I finally understand this feeling of uncertainty that leaves me now)

Tongue tied
I feel so terrified
I'm so sick of being on my own (this feels like suicide)
Tongue tied 
I feel so dead inside
Struggling in a world I can't control (this feels like suicide)
