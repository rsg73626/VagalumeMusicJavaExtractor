BESIDE MYSELF

Got no reservations
Got no guarantees
Got no complications
Holding on to me

But I must confess
Rage... opens my eyes (turns my face to stone)
And calls my name (calls my name out)
When I'm beside myself (it calls my name, name, name, name, name)

There you stand the victim
Of your own tragedies
Your head is tired, your dream seems gone
And your hands they bleed, from crawling on your knees
Help me please

Cuz I must confess
Rage... opens my eyes (turns my face to stone)
It calls my name (it calls my name out)
When I'm beside myself (it calls my.. name)

I don't really wanna talk right now
I just need some time to think...
Wanna be cool, wanna kind
Clear my modeled mind (clear my modeled mind)
I try to be cool, I try to be kind
But the anger makes me blind

I haven't slept for days
Yeah... yea....
I don't know who I am anymore
Or who you've become
I just need some time alone

Secretly hated and cast out, cast out
Secretly hated and sold out, sold out
Secretly hated and cast out, cast out
I'm secretly sold out, sold out, sold out

Rage, opens my eyes (and turns my face to stone)
It calls my name (calls my name out)
When I'm beside myself
It calls my.. name
