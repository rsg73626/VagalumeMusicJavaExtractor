MORE THAN I EVER WANTED

Here I come

I tried to heal you but my enemy was strong
I tried to kill it but it rendered me unsung
I tried to taste you but your bitter to my tongue
But I still believe, I still still believe
I can set you free

I burn with fire you'll pretend
I am your enemy and friend
I feel your hate that's deep within
More than I ever wanted
I'll beat the loser you defend
You'll be my enemy and friend
I feel your hate that's deep within
More than I ever wanted

There's no time to think it over when I see red (when I see red)
Left into a world that's in my mind
So very cold from which
I can set you free

I'll burn with fire you'll pretend
I am your enemy and friend
I feel your hate that's deep within
More than I ever wanted
I'll beat the loser you defend
You'll be my enemy and friend
I feel your pain that's deep within
More than I ever wanted

Stay away, make yourself turn away
Look away, all the envy I cant explain
It still remains when I turn away

I can set you free
I burn with fire you'll pretend
I am your enemy and friend
I feel your hate that's deep within
More than I ever wanted
I'll beat the loser you defend
You'll be my enemy and friend
I feel your pain that's deep within
More than I ever wanted
Wanted
Wanted
Wanted
