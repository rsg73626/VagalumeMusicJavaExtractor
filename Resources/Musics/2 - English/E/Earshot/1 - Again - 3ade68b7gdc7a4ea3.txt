AGAIN

As I poner my
Thoughts and fears in life
I stand tempted to throw it all away
So I sit and I 
Slowly loose my mind
Look for signs of you
Just to feel it again

[chorus]
Need to find my way back home again
A place where I can feel myself again
Leave the world behind and start again
Again

As I gather myself I know that I
Still stand tempted to throw it all away
So I sit and I 
Watch the world pass by
Look for signs of you
Just to feel it again

Another lonely day 
As the sunlight turns to haze
I'm calling you to say 
I miss you I'm ok

It's hard for me to say
I feel so far away
Soon one of these days
I'll be back home to stay
