WAKE UP

Fall to my knees just to be close to God
and I fall to the floor from your love
I am weakened by your tenderness
and touched by your innocence
I search just to find that you're enough
I'm here, call on me
everything, you and me
every moment I think of you is...(every thought that shatters)

All this time just to break up
I'm bored and so alone
wake up
I'm bored and so alone
wake up

I will be your protector 
guided by the light from heaven
I will stand and never be undone
like a flame with a million hours
keeping warm this enchantment
all that goes inside this grace is yours
I'm here, call on me
everything, you and me
every moment I think of you is...(every thought that shatters)
[chorus]
Love me, love me before you tell me all the reasons why you wouldn't have me
everything's so fucked up in my head
I don't know for sure that's what she said
tell me, tell me please won't you let me tell you how inside I feel so empty
nothing left just thoughts of better times
letting heal this broken heart and mind
I can't find your will to be saved
waking all this fear inside me
I can't find your will to be saved
wake up find yourself inside me
