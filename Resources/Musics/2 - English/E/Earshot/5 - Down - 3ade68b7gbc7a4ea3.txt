DOWN

I
Wonder what the day will bring tomorrow when I wake
Why
Do I decide to dwell upon mistakes I haven't made
Maybe I'm afraid 
So I try (I try to find the words to explain)

[chorus]
Why I feel so down

Don't ask why
I could care less of the world outside
One more time
I'll come out of the dark of my mind
Who knows what I find
Still I try (I try to find the words to explain)

So I look for a dark place to hide
Must be a reason I do
Why do I
Seem unsatisfied?
(I try to find the words to explain)
