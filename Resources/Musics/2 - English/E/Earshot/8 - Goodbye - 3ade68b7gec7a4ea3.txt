GOODBYE

Hollow
Seem the stars in the sky
Where my dreams they seem to follow
Shadows
In the walls of my mind 
ANd these thoughts they seem so shallow

I can't make sense of all this
Delivered to confusion from bliss
Sufered so long and I miss
Feeling alive

[chorus]
No
I'm not scared to say goodbye, I've had enough
Of your sick and twisted lies
ANd your cold an heartless words
When you're slowly coming to
No I won't be with you
Do you feel the way I feel
Do you feel me moving on

Again I find
I'm searching for a place to run and hide
Somewhere to rest my mind
A moment to feel myself again and never say

I can't make sense of all this
Delivered to confusion from bliss
Sufered so long and I miss
Feeling alive

I'm ok
Now without you
Time to finally turn the page
So hurt and I
Won't forgive what you did to me
I can hardly breathe
