NICE TO FEEL THE SUN

Sometimes I feel as though my life's getting stranger
Now I need to find a way to get this strain off of my back
Sometimes we need to lock the doors
And throw away the key
Sometimes we need to live and let be

[Chorus]
It's nice to feel the sun

So I awake to find that I'm in no danger
I finally found the strength I need still spinning on my back
And now I feel the sun
Shining down on me
Sometimes we have to live and be free

For days now I waited for the light to shine
Shine down on me
