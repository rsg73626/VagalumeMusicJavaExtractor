GET AWAY

You stay all in one piece when broken 
Kind remarks, and your words soft-spoken 
Driving far from the path of destruction 
Coming ever so close to throwing it all away again 

Is this all some great big lie? 
Twisted and working on something deep down 
That you should?ve never kept inside 

How much must I live through just to get away? 
(All this tension and so alive) 
How much must I live through just to get away? 
(All this pressure that makes your head feel so tired) 

You've been through the worst encounters 
Searching out the truth, the light, and way 
You have thoughts of peace and silence 
Coming ever so close to giving it all away again 

Is this all some great big lie? 
Sick and disturbing, you want no answers 
But you should've never looked inside 

How much must I live through just to get away? 
(All this tension and so alive) 
How much must I live through just to get away? 
(All this pressure that makes your head feel so tired) 

And sometimes it seems easier to burn it to the ground 

Can we get away now? 
Can we get away now? 
Can we get away now?
