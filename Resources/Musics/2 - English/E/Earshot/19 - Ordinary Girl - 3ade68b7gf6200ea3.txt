ORDINARY GIRL

Wait, there is too much on my mind
are we here just to simply pass the time?
all these questions awake inside my head
all these questions awake inside me...[repeat]

Now, what I would give
what I would try...
to be with just an ordinary girl
what I would give again, only if I...
could be with just an ordinary girl

Stop, I'm not happy anymore
you bring heartache and anger to the core
I have nothing to give inside me now
I have nothing to give inside me...[repeat]
[chorus]
Doesn't really matter, I'm alone now
thrown out to the world
do you feel the same?
