UNFORTUNATE

I wanna be sure
I wanna make clear
I want you to know
I love you my dear
me, I'm so dirty, covered in spite
maybe you'll come back cuz you want me, maybe you won't

But you were so young
don't you feel dumb?
you're not the only unfortunate one

Held in your head
the things that they said
and all of the lies and bad things they did
me, I'm unworthy, callous and cold
maybe you need me cuz you're lonely, maybe you don't
and we all live
and make mistakes
and build up walls that make us safe
