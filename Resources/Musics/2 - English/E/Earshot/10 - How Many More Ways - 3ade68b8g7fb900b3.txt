HOW MANY MORE WAYS

Should of stayed at home today
Should of left and slipped away
Just another day where nothing goes my way
So, leave me alone
Just need a moment on my own
So quiet and cold
Waiting for something else to fall apart again


How many more ways
Can I try to make this anger go away
How many more days
Of insanity that no one can explain
How many more ways until my life
Of my way

No, you will never know my pain
No, and you will always be the one I choose to blame
So, leave me alone
Just need a moment of my own
So quiet and cold
Waiting for something else to fall apart again


How many more ways
Can I try to make this anger go away
How many more days
Of insanity that no one can explain
How many mistakes will I make
Before your too afraid to stay
How many more ways until my life
Of my way

Sometimes I forget
That I am not alone
I try to think of other things to
Get back in control
And its all around me now
And this battle wages on
Inside
When will it finally subside
And bring me peace of mind again?

How many more ways
Can I try to make this anger go away
How many more days
Of insanity that no one can explain
How many mistakes will I make
Before your too afraid to stay
How many more ways until my life
Of my way
