SOMEONE

And if you could make up
For every single time you lied 
I'd probably whisper this
Hello, goodbye
And so it begins again
Harder each and every time
I start to reminisce
I never seem to ever find

[chorus]
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
Someone who will never try
To bring me to my knees
Someday I will find again
Someone just like me
Someone who will take the time 
In understanding me

And if I could make up 
For every single tear you cried
I'd probably never miss
Your hand in mine
I never could understand 
Mistakes I repeat again
I've been through this so many times
I never seem to ever find

And I've stopped searching
To take my time
And to really clear my head
And I believe it was meant to be
And I feel it's time to go

And if you could make up
For every single time you lied
I'd probably whisper this
I never seem to ever find
