MISERY

Looking through the hole of time
I can see the end is coming
closer - I can hear it calling
(beating away at me)
touching every soul in fear
comforting from far and near
how I wish you all the best
(in all your misery)
Angry and I'm feeling so (scared)
only cuz i wanna face all these fears
I close my eyes
(I'm drifting out far away)
angry and I'm feeling so...
only cuz I wanna face all these fears
I close my eyes
(to sleep off this misery)
Hello darkness there inside
blacking out the light of day
stick your heart out open wide
let it go and find its way
Looking through the hole of time
(you'll never get away)
touching every soul in fear
(and all of your misery)
looking through the hole of time
(you'll never get away)
closer - I can hear it calling
