ROTTEN INSIDE

Once was a time 
I'd give the world to you
But it was never enough
Sworn by your hand
But you never told the truth
That's when I saw myself in you

[chorus]
I'm rotten inside
I'm weak and I'm frightened of the things that you might find

What could I 
Do to make everything alright
Left me again 
Like I always thought you'd do
That's when I saw myself in you

And though I try
I can't forget
The way you looked at me and said
