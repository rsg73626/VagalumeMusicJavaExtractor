ASLEEP, I LIE

I can't stay forever 
and you're too insulting to me (darling)
I can't live forever and be who they want me to be and...

I 
I cannot pretend
I will not surrender these dreams in my head
I 
I will not disguise
they cannot cover the stars in my eyes
asleep I lie

Fall, like I do 
will this be the first time for you?
walk on me, I walk on you
stuck on me, stuck on you
[chorus]
All the things they're telling me
make me wanna up and leave
but I'm not sure that now's the time
and I'm not sure of anything
but even if I crossed the line
at least I'm being true to life
It's me out with the stars tonight [repeat]
