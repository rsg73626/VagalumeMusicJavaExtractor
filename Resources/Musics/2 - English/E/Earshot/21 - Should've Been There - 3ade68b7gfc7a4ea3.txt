SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE

I hope I'm not too late
I hope that you're ok
I left in a hurry
As soon as they told me
So I prayed for you
Hang on till tomorrow
Just don't leave me here today
I'm coming home to you

[chorus]
(Should've been there)
Should've been there I wanted to
(Should've been there)
Should've been there right next to you
(Should've been there)
Should've been there to comfort you
(should've been there)
Should've been there to sing to you
(should've been there)
Should've been there to hold your hand
(should've been there)
Should've been there to be with you
After all that we've been through

Yes, it's hard to say goodbye
And what I wish right now is to somehow turn back time
With all of the love
And respect
That I hold right here for you
Hang on till tomorrow
Just don't leave me here today
I'm coming home to you
