THIS WORLD

I never cared much for this world
(I just want to be someone like you)
but I never said I wouldn't reach deep down to blow them all away

I can feel it
but I don't know where my life's supposed to go
I can see it
but I'm covered by the fear of the unknown
I could hear it
but my head's too sick to listen on my own
wanna do it my way

I never had much of my own
(I just wanna feel the sun like you)
but I never said I wouldn't spread these wings to rise and fly away
[chorus]
Will I be here for you?
of course I will
just remember when you're by yourself...
I've faced trying times, and I've seen pain
I've been through many different walks of life
and just because I haven't seen them all
doesn't really matter cuz I'm floating
