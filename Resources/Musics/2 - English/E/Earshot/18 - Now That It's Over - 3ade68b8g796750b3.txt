NOW THAT IT'S OVER

Too much
Too kind
I thought with my heart not my mind
Time heals all pain
But it's taking longer
Build me up, cut me down
Hanging on to pieces as they fall from me
Pick me up, put me down
Looking for the missing things that used to be there

Now that it's over
I am one again
Now that it's over
I can start again
Now that it's over
I can feel no pain
Now that it's over

Silently
Desperately
Words of self destruction always come to me
Silently
Violently
And it's taking over
Build me up, cut me down
Hanging on to pieces as they fall from me
Pick me up, put me down
Looking for the missing things that used to be there

Now that it's over
I am one again
Now that it's over
I can start again
Now that it's over
I can feel no pain
Now that it's over
I can feel again... I can feel again... feel again

Tell me, do you really want to take
And throw it all away again? (but now it's over)
Tell me, do you really want to take
And throw it all away again? (no no no no no...)
It's too late to try, and I can't waste no more time
No more time... throw it all away
