NOT AFRAID

Don't leave me alone
I'm feeling so numb
I need you to be here, I need you to call
and everything's wrong
a beautiful shame
and everything's ugly, hazy, and gray
and doesn't it hurt?
trick and control you
deceive and destroy you
doesn't it hurt?
forget and move on
I'm here and I'm strong
I've got you to blame when it's finally done

[chorus]
I'm not afraid
of these feelings here inside
I'm sure someday I'll let go of all this hate for you...
I'll let go of all this hate

Does it make you feel inside what you've never felt before
does it promise you a life, but that left you all alone
and doesn't it hurt?
trick and control you
deceive and destroy you
doesn't it hurt?
forget and move on
I'm here and I'm strong
I've got you to blame when it's finally done

[chorus]

doesnt it hurt you
doesnt it feel sick
doesnt it hurt you
doesnt it feel sick
and Im on my way

I'm not afraid
of these feelings here inside
I'm sure someday I'll let go of all this hate for you...
I'll let go of all this hate I wont come around no more 
I just let you go away
I wont come around no more
I lost my way
really lost my way 
so really lost my way
