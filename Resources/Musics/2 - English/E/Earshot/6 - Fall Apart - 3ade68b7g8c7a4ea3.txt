FALL APART

So you finally found a way
To lessen all your pain
What you'd give to feel again
For even just the day
And as you search to find the words
For someone to relate
You realize all your faults
Were never their mistakes

[chorus]
And everything starts to fall apart
Covered in ink to hide these scars
And everything ends the way it starts
I just wanna feel like I belong

Could this be the one last time
That brings about the change
The moments in your life
When you know it has to change
Another waste of time
Another dream in flames
And once you feel the fire
You'll never be the same

All my life, I've done nothing but hide from myself
(over and over again)
All my life, I've done nothing but lie to myself 
(over and over again)
