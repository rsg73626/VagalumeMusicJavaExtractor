WE FALL, WE STAND

Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it all
abused and beat down and thrown to the wall
how can they do this to someone at all?
something so awful
woke up this morning I hoped and I prayed
nothing can stop me I'm well on my way
if I can have anything that I want 
why does this happen?

We gain, we lose, we fall
and we stand right up again
we gain, we lose and we fall
and we stand right up again
I can be anything I want to be
losing myself in a world that can't be
coming together and falling apart we stand....we fall....

I can see clearly the crack in your soul
looking for something to patch up the hole
if you need someone to reach for, console, just call my name...
you have been searching for so long inside
a meaningful calling your heart can't deny
I try so hard just to stand on my own
how can this happen? (again)
[chorus]
I can finally see the light
no more darkness
