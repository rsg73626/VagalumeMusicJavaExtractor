LORD'S PRAYER

Our father, thine is the kingdom 
The power and glory 
For ever and ever 
Amen 

Our Father, which art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name 
Thy kingdom come 
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven 
Give us this day our daily bread 
And forgive us our trespasses 
as we forgive those who trespass against us 
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil 
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever 
Amen 

Our Father, which art in heaven 
Hallowed be thy name 
Thy kingdom come 
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven 
And forgive us our trespasses 
as we forgive those who trespass against us 

Father, hear my prayer 
Lord, hear my prayer 
Let us pray 

The lord is my shepherd 
I shall not want 

Amen 

Our father, thine is the kingdom 
The power and glory 
For ever and ever 
Amen
