THE END

At the end of a rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told

But our love has a treasure
Our hearts can always spend
And it has a story
Without any end

At the end of a river
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go

But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on
Till the end of time

At the end of a river
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go

But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
