SENDING LETTERS TO JERSEY

This spring rain reminds me, of that April day
The sky cleared up so quickly, before I got the chance to say

I caught a cold the day you left
I spent the next three days in bed
Replaying our last kiss in my head
Jersey feels so far away
So far away, so far away
So I'm writing you to say:

Here I am, miles away
Honestly, it's killing me that you're so far
Break away, fall into my arms
It feels like so long since you've been gone
So please hurry
Love always, me

This spring rain reminds me, of that April day
Still haven't sent a letter, so I'm writing you to say:

Here I am, miles away
Honestly, it's killing me that you're so far
Break away, fall into my arms
It feels like so long since you've been gone
So please hurry
Love always, me
