WHATEVER I WAS THINKING

You've been haunting my nights
And embracing my days
I just can't seem to find a new way to say
I need some help, so please lend me your hand
I'm not walking the same
You're not the same anymore

Well it's time to say goodbye to your first real try, your first goodbye
It's time to try to say goodbye, to say goodbye, this time

You're leaving faster
I'm breathing faster
I want to let you out
Let you out of my heart
But you have the key
To set me free
So set me free
From this tiny affair

Well it's time to say goodbye, to your first real try, your first goodbye
It's time to try, to say goodbye, to say goodbye, this time

Honestly, there has to be a way
