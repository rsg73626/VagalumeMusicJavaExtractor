REWIND TODAY

I'll think things over
All these choices that I've made
These past summer days have gone to waste
Oh what I'd do to live today all over in a different way

Rewind today
I'll go back to those nights when I had the chance to say
I'd live a day where last regrets are never worth the wait
Never worth the wait

All these nights searching for answers
Scripted by an innocent teen dream
Broke down dreams and nicotine
I play this scene, I'm ready to escape
So I'll leave before I got the chance to say

Rewind today
I'll go back to those nights when I had the chance to say
I'd live a day where last regrets are never worth the wait
Are never worth the wait

All these nights out for answers
Only to see them straight ahead
All these nights I'd search for answers
Hoping to find myself again
So I'll leave before I got the chance to say

Rewind today
I'll go back to those nights when I had the chance to say

Rewind today
I'll go back to those nights when I had the chance to say
I'd live a day away, where last regrets are never worth the wait
Never worth the wait
Never worth the wait
