THE END OF ALL SEASONS

It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your mind
It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your side

Don't go run and hide
There's no compromise
Open up your eyes
And you'll see me
Waiting for you

I need some answers so we can try too
The sun comes up, the sun comes up
I hope you're happy, cause I don't need these long drives anymore

It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your mind
It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your side

We fall too far
And break this thing
The seasons change
My heart has changed
Don't scream my name now
It's far too cold
I don't want you cold

I need some answers so we can try to
The sun comes up, the sun comes up
I hope you're happy, cause I don't need these long drives anymore

It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your mind
It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your side

Right from the very start
I knew we'd grow apart
Just seperate my lungs for good
Right from the very start
I knew we'd grow apart
Just seperate my lungs for good
So I can breathe the air you breathe
Cause you're what's killing me
Don't make this hard
Don't make this hard

I need some answers so we can try too
The sun comes up, the sun comes up

It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your mind
It only took a lifetime, for the rest of your life I was on your side

It only took a lifetime
