VOULEZ VOUS COUCHER AVEC MOI

VOULEZ-VOUS COUCHER AVEC MOI
(WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLEEP WITH ME?)
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
Ce soir
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
I want you
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
Te Quiero
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
Gimme all your love

Baby, it's true, I must confess
You're the only man I kiss
Cause I love you sweet caress
Come on, take me
Taste my cherry lips
It's your body that I miss
Cover me with love

I wanna make you sweat and do you wet
Moon gone into the break and dawn
Give me sweet and you'll never forget
Baby, baby, I'm gonna take your soul
Your sexy body is out of control
Making love to you is like a dream in heaven
Come on, baby, let me feel your passes
Oh-la-la and sans cesse boom

[chorus]

Come on, make me wet
Come on, make me sweat
Tell me all your dreams
I will make them real
Come into my bed
Baby, I can't wait
Gimme all your love
Just can't get enough

[chorus]

Don't stop, I love the way you breathe
When you're lying next to me
When you are inside of me
I am yelling for your tender touch
You can never get enough
Cover me with love

Too sexy or too wise, huh
Wanna heat - baby please don't start
Give me your love - this's also real
Take me, take me, and let me feel
That dreams of passion destroy my soul
Making love to you is like having fun
Come on, baby, let me take you to the moon
Oh-la-la and sans cesse boom

[chorus]
