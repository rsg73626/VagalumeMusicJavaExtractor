KISS ME

Kiss me - fly me up high
Wanna feel like a frisbee - high in the sky
Oh i want you to kiss me - do it all right
Cos i know that you miss me

I dreamed of you
In so many lonely nights
With my body and soul
And i know you were
Out there in the city lights
Just out of control

Rap: hey i walked around and all i found
Was me myself just losing ground
I missed you - but i walked on thin ice
Like a clown in disguise
All the time there was your face
You only you can end the race
Love me - in the heat of the night
Babe i fell like dynamite

Oh baby just kiss me - fly me up high
Wanna feel like a frisbee - high in the sky
Oh i want you to kiss me - do it all right
Cos i know that you miss me
Oooh kiss me all over tonight

Kiss me tonight
Till you find the secret spot
Up and down and again
Baby lay by my side
And search for the honey pot
I know that you can

Rap: i'm doin' what you want to do
You know the stories about me are true
I'll kiss you - you know i care
Here and there and everywhere
Come closer - let me feel your tongue
It's so good - it can't go wrong
Together we'll climb the hill
Oh what a thrill - if you will

Oh baby just kiss me - fly me up high
Wanna feel like a frisbee - high in the sky
Oh i want you to kiss me - do it all right
Cos i know that you miss me
Oooh kiss me all over tonight

Kiss me - fly me up high
Wanna feel like a frisbee - high in the sky
Oh i want you to kiss me - do it all right
Cos i know that you miss me

Oooh kiss me all over tonight

Kiss me - baby i want it i want you to miss me
Baby i need it i need you to kiss me
Baby i love you i love you so much

Kiss me
