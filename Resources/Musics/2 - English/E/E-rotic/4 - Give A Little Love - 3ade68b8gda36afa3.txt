Hey give a little love and do a little healin’

Hey it’s cool – It’s hot – It’s really on the spot
I’ll wrap my love around you – I found you – Thank God
The two – Of us – In a night like this
You know how you need it – And I know just how it is
It’s heaven or hell – Just remember how I feel
For you – And you too – You loved it – Oh well
It was nice like it was – But that wasn’t enough
To hit the stars above – We all need a little love

Oh baby give a little love
And I’ll give you the passion of my heart
Come on take a little time
And we can spend the night
Together
Just give a little love
To let me know that we will never part
Baby take a little dream
And let us keep the light
Forever

It’s no crime – It’s no sin – It’s not out and it’s not in
We give a little love – And a fortune we’ll win
I see in your heart – And I’ll take you by the hand
You want it – You need it – And you’ll get it in the end
Feel the ache – When you take
- All the dirt and the fake
I take you in my arms – It’s love we’ll make
When life is hurting and the times get tough
You need a lotta healing and you need a little love

Oh baby give a little love
And I’ll give you the passion of my heart
Come on take a little time
And we can spend the night
Together
Just give a little love
To let me know that we will never part
Baby take a little dream
And let us keep the light
Forever
