WISH YOU WERE HERE

Into the night I am falling
With no-one by my side
Missing your love, warm and tender
My heart feels like a satellite

I wish... yes, I wish you were here
In the dark of the night
And I miss you like crazy
I wish... yes, I wish you were here
Want you right by my side
So the nightmares won't chase me
Babe, it's more than a feeling
That sometimes comes and goes
I will hold you forever
You can trust me, heaven knows

I wish... yes, I wish you were here
'Cos I'm lost on my own
Torn between my emotions
I wish... yes, I wish you were here
And I feel so alone
Like a tear in the ocean

I wish... yes, I wish you were here
'Cos I'm lost on my own
Torn between my emotions
I wish... oh, I wish you were here
And I feel so alone
Like a tear in the ocean

I wish you were here
