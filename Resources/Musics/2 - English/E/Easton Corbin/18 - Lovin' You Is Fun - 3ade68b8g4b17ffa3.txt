LOVIN' YOU IS FUN

You got a cousin who's tellin' you somethin'
That don't have nothin' to do with the lovin' that we're in, baby
I hear she's sayin' this game we're playin' should be complicated
If you won't, I'll say it, I think she's crazy 'cause

Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now mama, don't you think
And we're having such a good time together
And it's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, lovin' you is fun
It's fun

I'm walking around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
There's no self-help book on your shelf, you know too well
They're tryin' to sell you somethin' for nothin' 'cause

Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now mama, don't you think
And we're having such a good time together and
It's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, lovin' you is fun

Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now mama, don't you think
And we're having such a good time together and
It's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, lovin' you is fun

This whole heart's never smiled so hard
Lovin' you is fun
Yeah it's fun
Yeah its fun
Lovin' you is fun
