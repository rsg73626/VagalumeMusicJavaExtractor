DIGGIN' ON YOU

[Verse 1]
You, me, sitting at a red light
Slow rolling 'round the square
You can't help looking just right
Everybody can't help but stare
We can go 'round again
Or we can get outta here

[Chorus]
I wanna write your name in the dust on the windshield
Ride you 'round town a time or two
Take you to the top of that big hill
Get a little lost in the light of the moon
Cause I'm buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you

[Verse 2]
Street lights, showin' that suntan off like a neon sign
But that bench seat country girl slow dance
Girl you're making it hard to drive
I can't hardly wait for the rest of this night

[Chorus]
I wanna write your name in the dust on the windshield
Ride you 'round town a time or two
Take you to the top of that big hill
Get a little lost in the light of the moon
Cause I'm buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you

[Bridge]
Got your smile on, got your cool on, got your ride on
Yeah everything I'm diggin' on

[Chorus]
I wanna write your name in the dust on the windshield
Ride you 'round town a time or two
Take you to the top of that big hill
Get a little lost in the light of the moon
Buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you

[Tag]
I'm diggin' on you
I'm diggin' on you
Buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you
