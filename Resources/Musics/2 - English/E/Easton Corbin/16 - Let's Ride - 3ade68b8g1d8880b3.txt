LET'S RIDE

Baby, can't you feel that?
Baby, don't you hear that?
That's the sound of freedom
Calling our names
It's turning us as always
All you got to do is turn the key
Let this feeling carry us away

Baby, let's ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that moon on the rise
Baby, let's ride
Miles of road where there ain't no wind in sight
Let the wheels of this brown truck
Kick up a little dust while you're holding on tight

Come on
Baby, let's ride

Girl, you know the night is young
There's no reason not to run
A few miles of memories down this road
Baby, we don't need a map
Pick a star and we'll follow that
What are we waiting on? Girl, let's go

Baby, let's ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that moon on the rise
Baby, let's ride
Miles of road where there ain't no wind in sight
Let the wheels of this brown truck
Kick up a little dust while you're holding on tight

Come on
Baby let's ride
Is how you got me feelin' right now
Baby, let's ride
Don't look back and never come down

Let the wheels of this brown truck
Kick up a little dust while you're holding on tight
Come on
Baby let's ride
