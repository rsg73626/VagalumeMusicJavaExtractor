A DOZEN ROSES

I guess you noticed there's only eleven roses
I chosen from our garden where they grew
Take the roses and look into the mirror
And the twelfth rose will be looking back at you

There's just something about us bringing roses
To a woman they say a more than a man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anyways
