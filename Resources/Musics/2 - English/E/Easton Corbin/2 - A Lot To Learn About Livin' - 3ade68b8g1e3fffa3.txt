A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT LIVIN'

Stepped off the plane down in Cabo
Just meaning to stay for a week
I got a funny sensation about this vacation
The second the sand hit my feet
Taxi driver took my two bags
He saw me looking at my watch
He said, you won't need that here 'cause
Time disappears
In paradise there ain't no clocks

You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer

He dropped me off at the hotel
I took a u-turn into the bar
I sat down on a stool out by the pool
Next to a lady smoking a Cuban cigar
I ordered a drink and took out my cell phone
I tried to make a call to L.A.
Dang thing wouldn't work, I started to curse
Bartender said, I bet it can wait

I, yi, yi . . . change is in the air
Now, I, yi, yi . . . ain't got a care

Six months later, I'm driving a taxi
I got a Hawaiian shirt and a tan
Pick up some guy in a Brooks Brothers tie
I say, it's time to loosen up man

There's a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different life down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer
