LEAVIN' A LONELY TOWN

Mama's standin' at the old screen door
With a dish rag in her hand
Cryin' like I never seen her cry before
Like she don't understand why

I'm leavin' a lonely town
I'm leavin' a lonely town

My old man he's workin' on his truck
Ain't never had much to say
Just shakes my hand and wishes me luck
And watches me walk away, yeah

I'm leavin' a lonely town
I'm leavin' a lonely town

Drivin' one last time down main street
Past the cafe on the square
Go slow by the window 'cause I know she's
Waitin' tables in there, but

I'm leavin' a lonely town
She knows, I'm leavin' a lonely town
I'm leavin' a lonely town
Lord, I'm leavin' a lonely town

Mama's standin' at the old screen door
Cryin' like I never seen her cry before
Lonely town, lonely town
Lonely town
