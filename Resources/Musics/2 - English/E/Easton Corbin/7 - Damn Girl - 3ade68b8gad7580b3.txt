DAMN GIRL

[Verse 1]
You're standing there, standing out
Every man in the crowd's wanting you
I gotta know what you think about me
Buying you a drink or two
I don't like to use this kinda language
'Round a lady

[Chorus]
But damn girl you're looking good from where I am girl
And if I could I would take your pretty hand in mine
This ain't just a pick up line
Damn girl what I wouldn't do to be your man girl
If you only knew what you're doing to this heart of mine
Only two words come to mind
Damn girl

[Verse 2]
No we don't have to drink at all
We can just sit here and talk all night long
We can take it on the floor
We can take it out the door girl, your call
It don't matter what we do
As long as I can do it with you

[Chorus]
Damn girl you're looking good from where I am girl
And if I could I would take your pretty hand in mine
This ain't just a pick up line
Damn girl what I wouldn't do to be your man girl
If you only knew what you're doing to this heart of mine
Only two words come to mind
Damn girl

[Chorus #2]
Oh damn girl you're looking fine from where I am girl
We lost track of time and now we're watching
That ol' sun come up from the hood of my old truck
Damn girl
What I wouldn't do to be your man girl
If you only knew what you're doing to this heart of mine
Only two words come to mind

[Tag]
Damn girl, damn girl
Ooh damn girl, damn girl
