I'M A LITTLE MORE COUNTRY THAN THAT

Imagine a dirt road full of pot holes
With a creek bank and some cane poles
Catching channel cat
I’m a little more country than that

Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the court house
While the old men chew the fat
I’m a little more country than that 

I just want to make sure you know just who you’re getting under this old hat
Cause girl I’m not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I’m a little more country than that

Think of a hank song from days gone
With a steel ride that’s so strong
It sends chills up your back
I’m a little more country than that 

If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you’re way off track
I’m a little more country than that

I just want to make sure you know just who you’re getting under this old hat
Cause girl I’m not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I’m a little more country than that
Yeah, I’m sure that you’ve heard those three words from Others
But they fell flat
But this ring ain’t some thing that I mean to give you
And then take back
I’m a little more country than that
I’m a little more country than that
I’m a little more country than that
