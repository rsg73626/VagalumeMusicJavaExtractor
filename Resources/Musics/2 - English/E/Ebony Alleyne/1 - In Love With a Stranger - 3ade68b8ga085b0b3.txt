IN LOVE WITH A STRANGER

OOh, yeah, yeah
(ooh, stranger, stranger)
(ooh, stranger, yeah)
(ooh, stranger, stranger, ooh)

You won't say all the money in the world
Could knock off you
To what we had, it ain't no funny
'cause I'll say that you don't care

And all it's left to say is goodbye, baby
I never really knew you well
And all you get to take
Is a heart that is empty
But I got a story to tell

In love with a stranger
Yes, I've been
In love with a stranger
So it seems
In love with a stranger
With a opened scar
Is tearing your heart to see

It was us at the station
Watching trains go by last year
So caught up in flirtation
Now your smile has disappeared

No wonder hear you say "I love you, baby"
The memories that we share remain
What happened to the man
Whose heart you gave me?
Can he come around once again?

In love with a stranger
Yes, I've been
In love with a stranger
So it seems
In love with a stranger
With a opened scar
Is tearing your heart to see

That's how I feel about you
That's why I'm blessed without you
That's why I'm not gonna cry any tear, no
I thought I really knew you
But now I see right through you
The spell is broken, my vision is free

In love with a stranger
Yes, I've been
In love with a stranger
So it seems
In love with a stranger
With a opened scar
Is tearing your heart to see

And all it's left to say is goodbye, baby
I never really knew you well
And all you get to take
Is a heart that is empty
But I got a story to tell

In love with a stranger
Yes, I've been
In love with a stranger
So it seems
In love with a stranger
With a opened scar
Is tearing your heart to see

In love with a stranger
Yes, I've seen

In love with a stranger
Stranger

In love with a stranger
And it hurts so bad

In love with a stranger
A love that I never had

In love with a stranger
Yes, I've been
