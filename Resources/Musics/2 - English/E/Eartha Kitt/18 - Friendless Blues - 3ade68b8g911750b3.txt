FRIENDLESS BLUES

Feel so lowdown and sad, Lord
Feel so lowdown and sad, Lord
Lost everything I ever had!

I met a man in my own home town, in my own home town
I met a man in my own home town
Coaxed me away, now he has thrown me down!

Ain't got no friend nowhere, Lord
Ain't got no friend nowhere, Lord
All by myself, no-one to care!

I just sit here, al alone and cry and moan
Sit here with the friendless blues!
