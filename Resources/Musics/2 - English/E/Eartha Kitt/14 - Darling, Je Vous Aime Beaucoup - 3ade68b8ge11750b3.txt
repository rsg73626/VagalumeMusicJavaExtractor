DARLING, JE VOUS AIME BEAUCOUP

Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
Je ne sais pas, what to do?
You know you've completely
Stolen my heart

Morning, noon and night-time too
Toujours, wonderin' what to do
That's the way I've felt
Right from the start

Ah, Cherie
My love for you is Tri's, Tri's fort
Wish my French were good enough
I'd tell you so much more

But I hope that you compree
All the little things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
I love you, yes I do

Wish my French were good enough
I'd tell you so much more

But I hope that you compree
All the things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
I love you, yes I do, I love you, yes I do
