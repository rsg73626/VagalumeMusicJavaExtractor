IF I CAN'T TAKE IT WITH ME WHEN I GO

If I can't take it with me when I go
I just ain't gonna go
If I can't take it with me when I go
I ain't leavin', I know

I've got minks and sables and diamonds and pearls
The things that men give to sweet little girls
I've kissed a little, and sometimes a lot
It took lots of kissin' to get what I've got

If I can't take it with me when I go
I just ain't gonna go
If I can't take it with me when I go
I ain't leavin', I know

Love's a luxury, but it makes men relax
And naturally there's a luxury tax
It don't take billions to get me to care
I've even been nice to a poor millionaire

If I can't take it with me when I go
I just ain't gonna go
If I can't take it with me when I go
I ain't leavin', I know

Pictures of Presidents give me a thrill
Especially on a thousand dollar bill
This legal tender brings me so much bliss
It's nice to be tender when it's legal like this

If I can't take it with me when I go
I just ain't gonna go
If I can't take it with me when I go
I ain't leavin', I know

I just ain't gonna go
I just ain't gonna go
