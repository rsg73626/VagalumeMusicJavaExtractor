MOUNTAIN HIGH / VALLEY LOW

If you need me I will be near by mountain high, valley low
My love follows you until the last
Lightening fast, turtle slow
Journey to the north star
South winds blow my thoughts to you

If you need me I will be near by mountain high, valley low
I'll be with you though I'll fortune sway
Lantern gay, willow sad
Spring will stroll out meadow
Everyday, winter gray, summer glad

When your hair turns snow white
You will find me by your side
I'll be with you though I'll fortune sway lantern gay, willow sad
If you need me I will be nearby mountain high, valley low

My love follows you until the last lightening fast, turtle slow
Go in search of new moons
Dreams will bridge the skies to you
If you need me I will be nearby, lantern gay
Willow sad, valley low, Mountain High!
