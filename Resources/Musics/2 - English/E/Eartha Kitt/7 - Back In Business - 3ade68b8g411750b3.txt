BACK IN BUSINESS

Yesterday it seemed the world was about to end
Didn't it?
Looked as though it woudln't last out the year
Yesterday disaster waited around the bend
Well, my friend
Spring is here

Back in business, and ain't it grand?
Let the good times roll
Yesterday things were out of hand
Now they're under control

Bye-bye blues, so long adversity
Happiness, hello! (Hello! Hello!)
Keep the status quo
Permanently so!

Back again like a boomarang
Same old stand
Same old gang
Back in business with a bang
Let the good times roll
