ALL I WANT IS ALL THERE IS AND THEN SOME

All I want is all there is and then some
All I want is all there is and more
A guy who, when my jokes aint' funny
Busts out laughin' and calls me Honey
All I want is all there is and then some

All I want is all there is and then some
Showers of devotion all the time
A guy who keeps his manly form
Choppin' wood to keep me warm
All I want is all there is and then some

Well why? Why not?
If I'm gonna want, I'm gonna want a lot
Now here's the score
Why wish for a loaf of bread when you can wish for a grocery store

All I want is all there is and then some
Start a social circle all my own
Have lunch with Mamie Eisenhower
And for a waiter, Tyrone Power
All I want is all there is and then some

All I want is all there is and then some
Do a thing that no one's ever done
Visit Paris in the Spring
Then shut up, not say a thing
All I want is all there is and then some

All I want is all there is and then some
3d color television now
Table cloths of mink and sable
Platinum ashtrays on the table
All I want is all there is and then some

Well why? Why not?
If I'm gonna want, I'm gonna want a lot
Now here's the score
Why wish for a loaf of bread when you can wish for a grocery store

All I want is all there is and then some
Forty guys who want a date each night
Make a date with everyone
Then stand 'em up and watch the fun
All I want is all there is and then some
