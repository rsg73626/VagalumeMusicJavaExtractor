AT LAST

At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

At last, the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clovers
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a dream to press my cheek to
A thrill that I had never known

You smiled, and then the spells came
And here we are together
For you are mine, at last
