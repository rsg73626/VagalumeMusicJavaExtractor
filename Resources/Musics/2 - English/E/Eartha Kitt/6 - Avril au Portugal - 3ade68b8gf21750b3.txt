AVRIL AU PORTUGAL

I found my April dream
In Portugal with you
When we discovered romance
Like we never knew

My head was in the clouds
My heart went crazy too
And madly I said
"I love you"

This sad reality
To know it couldn't be
That's Portugal and love
In April

The music and the wine
Convinced me you were mine
But it was just the spring
Fooling me

I found my April dream
In Portugal with you
When we discovered romance
Like we never knew

Then morning brought the rain
And now my dream is through
But still my heart says
"I love you"

I found my April dream
In Portugal with you
When we discovered romance
Like we never knew

Then morning brought the rain
And now my dream is through
But still my heart says
"I love you"
