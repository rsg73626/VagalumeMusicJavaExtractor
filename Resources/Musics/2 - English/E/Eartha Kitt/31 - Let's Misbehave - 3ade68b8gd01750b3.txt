LET'S MISBEHAVE

We're all alone
No chaperon
Can get our number
The world's in slumber
Let's misbehave

There's something wild
About you, child
That's so contagious
Let's be outrageous
Let's misbehave

When adam won eve's hand
He wouldn't stand
For teasin'
He didn't care about
Those apples out of season

They say the spring
Means just one thing
To little lovebirds
We're not above birds
Let's misbehave

(Scat)
Let's misbehave
(Scat)
Let's misbehave!

If you'd be just so sweet
And only meet
Your fate, dear
'Twould be the great
Event of nineteen twenty eight
Dear!
(Scat)
Let's misbehave!
Let's misbehave!
