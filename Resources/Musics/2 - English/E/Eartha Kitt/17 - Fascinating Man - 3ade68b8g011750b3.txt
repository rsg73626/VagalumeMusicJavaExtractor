FASCINATING MAN

Fascinating man, ain't you got no gal to love?
Ain't you got no lovin' gal to love you?
Chase away those blues
Got no time to lose
Plenty other women you can choose!

Fascinating man, what you waitin' for so long?
No use waitin' for that gal, 'cause she has done you wrong!
Honey, don't delay, just give me one little sign
Fascinating man, be mine!

Ain't you feelin' good?
Gee, I wish you would
Tell me that I ain't misunderstood!

Bewitchin' kind o' man, please believe I'd like to see
Not just fascinating you, but fascinating we!
Why do you resist?
You know you long to be kissed
By a fascinating gal - like me!
