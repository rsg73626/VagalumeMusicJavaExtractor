LOOKING FOR A BOY

I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love
Tell me please, where can he be
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreamin' of?

It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe
When he says hello, so
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love

If it's true that love affairs are all arranged in heaven
My guardian angel's holding out on me!
So I'm looking for a boy 'bout five foot six or seven
And won't be happy till I'm on his knee!
I'll be blue until he comes my way
Hope he takes the cue when I am sayin'

Tell me please, where can he be
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreamin' of?

It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe
When he says hello, so
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love
Won't you find that boy?
Help me find a boy
Who's lookin' for a girl to love
