CLOSE ENOUGH FOR LOVE

You and I, an unmatched pair
Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet
Not perfect yet but close enough for love

How old fashioned, pure romance
Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day
When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lives through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and the tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told
Not perfect yet but close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lives through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and the tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told
Not perfect yet but close enough for love
Not perfect yet but close enough for love
