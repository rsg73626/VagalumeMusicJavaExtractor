IF YOU GO AWAY (NE ME QUITTE PAS)

1. If you go away  on this summer day
Then you might as well  take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
when our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still  for the nightbird's song
if you go away (x4)
But  if you stay I'll make you a day
like no day has been or will be again
we'll sail on the sun  we'll ride on the rain
we'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
if you go away (x4)
2. If you go away as I know you will
You must tell the world  to stop turning till
you return again if you ever do
for what good is love without loving you
can I tell you now  as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly  till the next hello
if you go away (x4)
3. If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
just an empty room full of empty space
like the empty look  I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow  of your shadow if I
thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away (x3) please don't go away
But  if you stay I'll make you a night  like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go,  go, I won't cry though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away (x4)
