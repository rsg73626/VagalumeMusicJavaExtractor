LISBON ANTIGUA (IN OLD LISBON)

I gave my heart to you in old Lisbon that night
Under the spell of your charms
I felt your arms hold me so tight
`Twas heaven to find such bliss in each kiss
I lost my heart but I found one so true
In old Lisbon with you

It happened one night in Portugal
Lisbon was gay in the moonlight
The stars were shining above
When I found you, my love
What is this strangeness, this splendor
All this myst'ry that makes me surrender?
