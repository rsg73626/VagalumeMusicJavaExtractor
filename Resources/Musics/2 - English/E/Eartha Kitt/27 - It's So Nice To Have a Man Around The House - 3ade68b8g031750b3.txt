IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE A MAN AROUND THE HOUSE

It's so nice to have a man around the house
Oh, so nice to have a man around my house
Someone sweet who's glad he found you
Who will put his arms around you
And his kisses just astound you, it's so nice

Oh, a house is just a house without a man
He's the necessary evil in your plan
Someone kind who knows you treasure, any simple little pleasure
Like a full-length make-up to cover last year's blows
It's so nice to have a man around the house

It's so nice to have a man around the house
Oh, so nice to have a man around the house
Just a guy in and slippers
Who will share your breakfast keepers
And will help you zip your zippers, it's so nice

Oh, a house is just a house without a man
He is the necessary evil in your plan
Just a knight in shining armor who is something of a charmer
Even though he maybe someone else's spouse
It's so nice to have a man around the house

It's so nice, just about the most important thing I can think of
So put no one else above him, when you love him, really love him
Though it's true, the one you'll wind up with a louse
It's so nice to have a man around the house
So nice, so nice
