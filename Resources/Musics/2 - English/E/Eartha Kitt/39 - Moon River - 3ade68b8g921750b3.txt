MOON RIVER

Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style someday
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin'your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end

Waitin' round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
