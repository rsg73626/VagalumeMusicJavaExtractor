HESITATING BLUES

Hello Central, what's the matter with this line?
I wanna talk to that sweet man of mine
Tell me how long will I have to wait?
Please give me two nine eight, why do you hesitate?

What do you say, can't talk to my man?
A storm last night blowed the wire all down
Tell me how long will I have to wait?
Will he come back now or will he hesitate?

Procrastination is the thief of time
So all the wise owls say
One stitch in time may save nine
Tomorrow's not today
And if you put off, someone's bound to

Sunday night, my beau proposed to me
Said he'd be happy if his wife I'd be
Oh, how long will I have to wait?
Come be my wife, my Kate, why do you hesitate?

Well I declined him, just for a stall
He left that night on the Cannonball
Oh, how long will I have to wait?
Will he come back now or will he hesitate?

I'd be his, he'd be mine and I'd be feelin' gay
Left alone, grieve and pine, my best friend's gone away
He's gone and left me the hesitating blues
The hesitating blues, those hesitating blues
