HEY JACQUE

Hey Jacque
Have you seen Louie
Is he still in Paree?
I wait day after day
In that cafe, down by the river

Please, Jacque
If you see Louie
Tell him to come to me
I've tried, I can't forget
I love him yet
Please, Jacque tell Louie, for me

Ho la Jacque
Have you seen Louie
He's not come to see me
Do pre long time at no
I've waited, and waited
In that cafe, down by the river
No Jacque chem me te gal

Please, Jacque
If you see Louie
Tell him to come to me
I've tried, I can't forget
I love him yet
Please, Jacque, tell Louie, for me
