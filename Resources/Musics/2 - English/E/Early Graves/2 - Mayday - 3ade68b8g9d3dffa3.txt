MAYDAY

I've hit rock bottom again and I don't wanna call for help
I've been clawing at these walls, with nooses around my neck
I've folded all my cards
May day
I'm burning wicks at both ends
May day
Its true I'm coming undone
May day
You know I've been calling for help
May day
I need these shovel wings to get me to that coffin
Red night terrors and god, I smile at this all too often
I'm crashing down bursting in flames
May day
I need a touch of mercy you say
May day
I'm checking out
May day
