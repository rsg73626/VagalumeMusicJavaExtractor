WRAITHS

Keep your hatchets close and your wraiths closer
Give no quarter
Light my way in black
No one shall inherit the earth
Never forgive
I've always believed in vengeance
Too much is never enough
I'll carry out that sentence
With a different kind of love
No one shall inherit the earth
Vengeance guide my hand
Vengeance give me strength
Vengeance mother of god
Take me to the brink
Vengeance, let the blood run
Let it fill the sea
Vengeance, turn the knife on me
Then ill finally be free
