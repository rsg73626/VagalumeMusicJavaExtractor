Trek boys!!!

You aint seen me in a minute
Petey Pablo
We're gettin XXX'd man

[J-Kwon]
Imma run while gettin front
It's cuz your gettin none
Here the cop, they hit a nun
It's all with a gun
What is done is what is done
It's all for the fun
Somebody said cut off they head, it's already done
Now I'm clap wit mini straps including mini matched
Wit a bat, my clipse on, I'm bangin wit that
Where it's at what it's at
Don't worry bout that
Your a soldier, where a soldier relate to that
Now I'm marching down the ally
In a rally
Some meany motherfuckers they try, we need a tally
Now we, put it in mind and then we outty
Rowdy, they step on a bomb
The bomb outty
Doubt me, I start to shoot up your Denali
Try Kwon, here give a bomb to your family
Met your family in a start that you can't see
But yo I'm gon' do it anyway

[Chorus: Ebony Eyez]

[Petey Pablo]
Come take a ride as we roll to the ghetto
But keep your feet on the pedal 
Cuz it could get pretty extreme in the ghetto
Triple X level, no holds bar
We got hood cap, and luitenets, and project sergeants
Capable of pullin your car, bombin your car
Grenades through your window, this is all our war
Take the main road here where we go
Everytime we roll
Family transportin, guns stashed in truck flow
Real talk dog, I hit real hard
One swing knock a motherfucker block
Slam off (slam off)
Hit him in the part where he talk from
Naggin back to momma cuz the wires in his jaw make it hard for him to tell you something (tell you something)
It's sunny now but the storm comin
Best thing for you to do is try to get prepared for it (for it)
Find'em bread, water, milk, couple cans of soup, and a place to go just incase you have to move

[Chorus: Ebony Eyez]
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)

Finally, when it comes to the tools
I'm not forgiving the blues
I'll knock another man clean out his shoes
We get the breakin the rules
Lets get the takin his jewels
Sit still, trippin, turn his ass into dog food
Who's got he static (huh)
Better bring the plastic (uh)
Better automatic (punk)
And let him have it (chump)
I'm a savage (What?)
Let me show you magic (bra)
Wish I had this and turn your ass saw dust
Partner we lawless
I'm talkin all us
When it come to handlin business, durrty we flawless
See these revolvers
Thats why they call us
The same reason the police never aint caught us
I'm on another level
Words from a true rebel
I rock your ass and I ain't talking heavy metal
Your just a punk and me I'm durt devil
Lets see what's left as soon the the smoke settle

[Chorus: Ebony Eyez]
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
We can take it thurr (We can take it thurr)
We can handle that (We can handle that)
