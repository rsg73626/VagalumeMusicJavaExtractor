BROKEN WINGS

Yeah (aww yeah)
Its like erything you stand for, ery expierience you ever faced in life brings you to a point whether to believe in yourself or believe in what somebody else foreces upon you in a dead crossroads is when you make a decision either to be a soldier or a coward

We walkin through this world unknown flyin on these wings is broken, flyin on these wings is broken

Now i heard ery day about everything that i shouldnt do
Lyk sex n drugs n rock n roll tellin me who i shouldnt screw
Got sisters mamas n cousins buggin n buzzin in my ear
Brother pullin n tuggin shovin tellin em what they wanna here
So hard to stay sane n maintain amongst these lame brains
Lookin at me strange sayin ima change when i get sum change
Niggas steady yappin sayin i wont blow up from rappin
I should do such n such plus i huss to much
But i dont worry be happy dont sweat it dont trip it
Dont let me get so pissed i do sum crazy cuz you might regret it
Dont need to keep bein childish n actin funny wit me
Its time to stop all this hatin n come make sum money wit me

We walkin through this world unknown flyin on these wings is broken, flyin on these wings is broken ( aww yeah) (repeat)

Now i heard ery day about everything that i should do
Lyk go to college graduate get a job what i could do
Is be more lyk my cousin a lawyer she doin good to
Tired of people stressin me devil keep on testin me
Soundtrack of real life it take a real nigga to make me a real wife
N i kno when the time has come itll feel right
For now im walkin down this dark road alone prayin to god to shed some light
Tryin to be so strong but i keep on breakin in pieces tryin to hold on
Dont wanna let go help me oh jesus
To shed the pain instead is seems lyk all you do for me is let it rain
Gotta be another route for me to get out before i go insane

We walkin through this world unknown flyin on these wings is broken, flyin on these wings is broken(aww yeah)(repeat)

Now i heard ery day about everything that i couldnt do
They said i wouldnt make it threw all tha shyt that they put me threw
They gossip about me when they not around me
I kno that they dont want me to rise they pray on my demise
N i kno haters out to get revenge lyk tha nerds n shyt juss gettin absurd
I swear it gets on my nerves
Talk shyt about me who cares
Gon get knocked down you stand in my way
Fuck payin some dues im due for some pay
Think ima let yall niggas push me
Naw way to intelligent to be talkin bout givin up some pussy
Juss for studio time you outta your mind
Your beats juss mediocer i got producers thats doper

We walkin through this world unknown flyin on these wings is broken, flyin on these wings is broken(aww yeah)(repeat)
