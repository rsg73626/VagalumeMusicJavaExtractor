IN YA FACE

Owww 

now it's the part where we break it down (uhuh) 
gon break it down (uhuh uhuh uhuh) 
gon break it down (uhuh) gon' break it down (uhuh) 
gon break it down (uhuh) 
just break it down (uhuh) 
now pick it up (uhuh just put it down) 
now pick it up (uhuh uhuh uhuh) 
now pick it up (uhuh) just pick it up (uhuh) 
now pick it up (uhuh) gon' pick it up (uhuh) 

I'm fresh off da block, fresh off da press yes 
Stay fresh wit the dress fresh sitting in the Lexus 
Fellas wanna date us and the heifers wanna fight us 
That's the word that got around 
that my joint's tight as arthritis 
And I gotta hit the club, gotta get some love 
Mixing with a lot of other stuff 
now I'm seeing double vision 
Baby daddies trippin with they baby mama starting drama 
But it ain't no room to fight tonight it's hotter than the sunna 
You it gotta be the Trackboyz if it's making that noise 
Getting paper too my pockets bigger than the Fat Boys 
Gon' look around while I gon' put it down 
While you scoping around I'm on the floor getting down 
But I gotta give you bits and pieces 
Anything else is indecent 
The club is packed with heaters 
Who don't get mad they get even 
It's getting hot in hurrr, tell me how you got in hurrr 
See so many fine niggaz glad my man not in hurrr 

[Refrão - 2X] 
now would you let me put my ass in ya face (in ya face) 
(would you let me put my ass in ya face) 
if I let you bend me over by the waist (by the waist) 
(if I let you bend me over by the waist) 

now I'm back once again 
back in the benz 
back with some friends 
stack in them ends 
getting it crackin again 
I don't need no writers 
middle finger to the biters 
and my shit on more rappers than babies in diapers and cycles 
and you can bet that I'm set 
jet in the vet 
aww and don't let me forget 
the best you done met yet 
and I ain't lying 
catch me buying trying to get inside my tight jeans 
the just ain't saying the right thing 
no matter how it might seem 
they like the way them ghetto girls can get they coochie poppin 
might take you out and wine and dine he will even take you shoppin 
now he gon' keep on spending 
long as you can keep from grinning 
guaranteed that you be winning 
this is only the beginning 
world gotta know 
that this girl gotta flow 
and I'm serving them yo 
nuthin like they've heard before 
and thats why I give it to them cause I know they want it and they need it 
Don't mean to sound conceited 
but if you don't eat it leave
