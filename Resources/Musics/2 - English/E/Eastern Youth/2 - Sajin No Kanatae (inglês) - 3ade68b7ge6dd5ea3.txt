SAJIN NO KANATAE (INGLÃŠS)

Like sand, like drizzle
The midday sun shines on me
My arrow of rejection goes through the clouds
Hits the sky and drops it
"With my eyes closed, I see mustard flowers, a sad memory"
Ridiculous sentiment
Now I look

It doesn't matter whether I see it or not
The world in front of me is in a sandstorm

Under flowing and vanishing scattered clouds
In a shadow of a building, in a piercing autumn wind
I stand there humming

"Is it sweet?
Is it bitter?
Is it warm?
Is it cold?"

Voice, do not feel ashamed
Voice, do not hesitate
Get right under the sun!

I'll just ramble till someday
I greet lazy darkness
With a subtle smile

Always, there's a ringing
Suddenly it awakes me
It is a voice without a voice
A song without a song

It doesn't matter whether I see it or not
The world in front of me is in a sandstorm
Under flowing and vanishing clouds
In a shadow of a building, in a cruel autumn wind
I stand there humming
(I don't even need words)
