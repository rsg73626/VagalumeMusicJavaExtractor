LEADFOOT

written a list of stupid things
this would be the king
crowned, sitting above the rest by a neck
it only takes a momentary lapse
the main offenders are easy to pick out 
they're spotted from one hundred paces
as a concensus would prove - prove

concensus proved

the point is insignificant 
when considered in comparison to
the sound of silence experienced
when the situation arises it feels like the armaggedon knocking
a wiring to the national grid
you don't need a reservation to join - join

(just) too little time
too little time

pedal stamp
hard grind
wet slip
stick shift
contact twist
asphalt recoil - asphalt recoil
