AMNESIA

I would walk
To remember to forget
To remember to forget
What do i have to offer you
The offer is not empty
The glass is so full
I wish that i could show you proof
I know that you are a gift to me
I know that you are a gift to me
I will lay where i fall
Little matters anymore
No need to fight the tide
All that i need is inside
I would wait
To remember to forget
To remember to forget
I feel the suns warmth on my face
Like the most beautiful flower
You are lifes gift to me
I know that you are a gift to me
I know that you are a gift to me
I will lay where i fall
Little matters anymore
No need to fight the tide
All that i need is inside
