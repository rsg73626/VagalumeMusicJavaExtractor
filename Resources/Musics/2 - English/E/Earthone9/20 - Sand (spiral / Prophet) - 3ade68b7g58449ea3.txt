SAND (SPIRAL / PROPHET)

when is the hour?
now or never
passing of the sand through hands
un-nurtured
see it right in front of me
nulify
wage a war on the spineless
i tire of

writhing, crawling - with maggots
writhing, crawling - with maggots
writhing, crawling - with maggots
writhing, crawling - with maggots 

lowest getting lower
un-rectified
the heirloom of un-culture
swine breeding
divide and yield cocoon sealed
diminished
so when is the hour
i'd say never

writhing, crawling - with maggots
writhing, crawling - with maggots
writhing, crawling - with maggots
writhing, crawling - with maggots
