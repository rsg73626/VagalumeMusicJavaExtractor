YOU AGAIN

i hope i never see you again
i hope i never touch you again
sometimes i wonder, whats fucked in my heart
wont let your fingers tear us apart

its all so simple, its all over again
a lack of talent is caving you in
sometimes i wonder whats fucked in your heart
we're losing grip now, now we're falling apart

the speaker speaks but the words sound haunted
so much its falling out of your hands
could you ever tell?

and its there for me, there to see
and its in full view
why did i waste my time on you?
