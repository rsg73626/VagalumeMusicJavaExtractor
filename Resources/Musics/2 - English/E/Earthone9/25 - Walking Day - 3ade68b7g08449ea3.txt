WALKING DAY

a circle - dwell as part
the cycle - dwell as part
to flourish - live within
to nourish - live within
so harvest the fallen
return what is given
carry forth the knowledge
be guided by the wise

why can't you see why can't you see
why can't you see why can't you say
bury the blessings had
drift back through ages past
to revere the walkers
but their mark we erase
cast shadows on the land
the oceans will return
from oceans be reborn
the fallen will return

why can't you see why can't you see
why can't you see why can't you say
