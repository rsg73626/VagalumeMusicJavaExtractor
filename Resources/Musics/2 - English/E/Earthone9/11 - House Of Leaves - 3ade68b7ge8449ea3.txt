HOUSE OF LEAVES

some will never fade 
indelible mark is made
those who wield the brightest flame
bring change
some marks are lighter 
some courses are longer 
some marks are lighter 
some courses are longer 
everyone will change
the remaining smoke ashes
the effort to remember
enslaves
some marks are lighter 
some courses are longer 
some marks are lighter 
some courses are longer 
but the autumn will still come
the leaves always fall
some will never fade 
indelible mark is made
those who wield the brightest flame
bring change
some marks are lighter 
some courses are longer 
some marks are lighter 
some courses are longer 
but the autumn will still come
the leaves always fall
