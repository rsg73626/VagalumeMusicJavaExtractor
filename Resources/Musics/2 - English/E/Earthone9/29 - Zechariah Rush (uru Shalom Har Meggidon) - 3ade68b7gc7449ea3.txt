ZECHARIAH RUSH (URU SHALOM HAR MEGGIDON)

when it comes down
will you fall away?
when it comes down
will you follow me?
when the chamber fires
will it suck you in?
when the seed spreads
will you accept the gift?

drag me away
pull me away

when the time comes
will you take the hand?
when the water burns
will you wait for rain?
when the wind blows
will you heed your fate?
as the plague hits
the circle seals you in

falling - away from this life
pull me - away
falling - away from this life
pull me - away
drag me away
pull me away

when the earth returns
will you heed your fate?
when the sun expires
will you lay her down?
when it comes down
will you fall away?
when it comes down
will you follow me?
