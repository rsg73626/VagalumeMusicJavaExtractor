two minutes
give in to me
two minutes
it's all i need
it's not much to ask, to ask for
there is, nothing left
give all the chance ?
i think, you do the same
and i gonna take that
no way ???
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cannot forgive you
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cant forgive
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
two minutes
give in to me
two minutes
it's all i need
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cannot forgive you
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cant forgive
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
