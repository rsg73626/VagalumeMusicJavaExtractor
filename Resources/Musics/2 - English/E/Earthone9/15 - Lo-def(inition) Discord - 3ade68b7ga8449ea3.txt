LO-DEF(INITION) DISCORD

You will never be the same again
You will never be the same again
You will never be the same again
You will never be the same

Temptation
I feel it, i greet it
I know it has a fucking name
I breathe it through the gills
A distraction - undermined, overblown
The seeds are sown, rachet
Caught in a grip that can only tighten

Never, never, never
You will never be
Never, never, never
You will never be
