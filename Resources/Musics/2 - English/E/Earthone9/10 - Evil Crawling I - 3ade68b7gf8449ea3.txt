EVIL CRAWLING I

left faithless
in the age of cain - no love lost
left lifeless
the lifeless have the key - belief-less
belief is gone the dogs come
seeking the truth to serve no use
no-one can wield the weapon 
(take me a-way)
we must flow as
waters flow as
rivers flow and
mountains can rise
the seers
the knowers still know - few of us
the others
unable to process the soundbytes
spirit is torn the dogs come
laying in shreds shrouding the heads
of heroes who've been martyred
(take me a-way)
we must flow as
waters flow as
rivers flow and
mountains can rise
left faithless
in the age of cain - no love lost
left lifeless
the lifeless have the key - belief-less
