AS OLD AS THE GRAVE

Oeh, misery is turning the ground
As old as the grave
As old as the grave
Oeh, misery is turning the ground
As old as the grave
As old as the grave

Father, you're drunk
Easy now
Mother in ocean
Is raining now
Still you got them eyes from thirst

You lay yourself down a bullet to the brain
And all world's words can't tell you that you're sane
Homeless beneath
Devil's moon
Find comfort in the dirt
I don't get down
No I
Check in the dream whilst I work
You lay yourself down a bullet to the brain
And all world's words can't tell you that you're sane
You lay yourself down a bullet to the brain
And all world's words can't tell you that you're sane
Sane, sane

Oeh, misery is turning the ground
As old as the grave
As old as the grave
Oeh, misery is turning the ground
As old as the grave
As old as the grave

Oeh, misery is turning the ground
As old as the grave
As old as the grave
Oeh, misery is turning the ground
As old as the grave
As old as the grave
Father, you're drunk
