CHOSEN

[Verse 1]
I'm lost in nowhere, I cannot see 
What's inside of me 
Some changes appear I can feel, 
I'm getting alive 

[Bridge]
My eyes are wide, 
Opened to this brand new world, 
I'm not supposed to bleed 

[Refrain]
Only my eyes can see your world, like it is, 
Blinded by innocence, see the moon fading out to black 
Leave out your mind 
And if I am the chosen one, I will try 
And making you understand, the silence can sometimes be your friend 
Whisper your fears 

[Verse 1]
Winter's breath leaves a cold leaf on my face 
My believing thoughts, 
Decrease in shapes of ghostly sadness 
I've failed out of weakness 

[Bridge]
My eyes are wide, 
Opened to this brand new world, 
I'm not supposed to bleed 

[Refrain]
Only my eyes can see your world, like it is, 
Blinded by innocence, see the moon fading out to black 
Leave out your mind 
And if I am the chosen one, I will try 
And make you understand, the silence can sometimes be your friend 
Whisper your fears
