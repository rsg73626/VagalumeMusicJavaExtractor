Oh, give me some will
Oh, help me be still
Oh, just wait untill
Oh, give me some will

Oh, help me be still
Oh, give me some will
Oh, just wait until
Oh, help me be still

I got lots of doubt
I am lost without
Been a painful drought
I can't live without
Know what that's about
Your on my mind 
Mind, mind

Something to change my mind
Something I need to find
I've been left behind
Gotta heed those signs
Again to let it slide
It would be a crime 
Crime, crime

You're on my mind 
Mind, mind

Oh, give me some will
Oh, help me be still
Oh, just wait untill
Oh, give me some will

Oh, help me be still
Oh, give me some will
Oh, just wait until
Oh, help me be still
Oh, give me some will
Oh, give me some will
