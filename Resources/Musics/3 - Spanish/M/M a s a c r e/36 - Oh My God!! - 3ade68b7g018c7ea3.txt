OH MY GOD!!

Oh my god
Sepulchres and graveyards
They are full of ashes
Bodies filled with bullets
Will be human remains
We’ve seen people
Fall on our ground
We live in silence
Out of this war
Death strikes this nation
Massacres and killings
Bleeding country in grief
Waiting for salvation
Too much injustice
Chains of pain and
Barbarism
No tomorrow
Cries of angels in heaven
Well i don’t understand
This fucking reality
Suffering, pain, pleasure, vengeance
From heaven it rains blood
One by one will die in this war
Perverse country of drugs and death
Requiem to the dead
Barbarity in this hell
Sacred to this land
In wave of violence
Suffering, pain, pleasure, vengeance
From heaven it rains blood
One by one will die in this war
Perverse country of drugs and death
Oh my god, pain or pleasure?
Oh my fucking god, my suffering!!!
Oh my god, pain or pleasure?
Oh my fucking god, my suffering!!!

Requiem to the dead
Barbarity in this hell
Sacred to this land
In wave of violence
Suffering, pain, pleasure, vengeance
From heaven it rains blood
One by one will die in this war
Perverse country of drugs and death
Oh my god, pain or pleasure?
Oh my fucking god, my suffering!!!
Oh my god, pain or pleasure?
Oh my fucking god, my suffering!!!
