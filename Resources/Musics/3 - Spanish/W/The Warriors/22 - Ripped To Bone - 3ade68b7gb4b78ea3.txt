RIPPED TO BONE

I too refuse that empty dream.
Born in castle with hope in hand.
Locked in cage and told to sing.
I’ll break the bars that break and bind me.
I choke on the words.
I can’t spit them out.
I choke on the words.
I’ll break your words before they suffocate me.
You destination ranks second to none.
Stepping on the weak.
Always watching out for number one.
My flesh is ripped right off the bone to feed the mouths all but my own.
All but my own.
Flesh ripped from the bone.
