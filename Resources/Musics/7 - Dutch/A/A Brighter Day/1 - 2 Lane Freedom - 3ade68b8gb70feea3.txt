2 LANE FREEDOM

Baby take a trip with me
I need it now, desperately
I got all the stuff I need
A tank of gas and you

Next to me
Next to me

I don't know where to go
Just need 2 b on the road
It just makes me feel
Immortal, here

Behind the wheel

It's 2-lane freedom 
2 lane 
It's 2-lane freedom 

Just feels good to have you near
The future's getting o so clear
Keep rolling down the road
While this world - around us

Just explodes

It's 2-lane freedom 
2 lane
It's 2-lane freedom 

It's 2-lane freedom 
2 lane
It's 2-lane freedom 
2 lane
2 lane
2 lane
2 lane 
It's 2-lane freedom 
2-lane freedom 
2-lane freedom 
2-lane freedom
