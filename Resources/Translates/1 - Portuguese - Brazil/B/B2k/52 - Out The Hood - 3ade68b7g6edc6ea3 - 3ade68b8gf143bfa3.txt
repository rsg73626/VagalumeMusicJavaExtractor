[Out The Hood]
Ohhh
Listen baby

[Verse 1:]
See theres this girl that i know
And shes more (more than average shes a perfect ten)
Dont really know how to handle someone who (wants to put her on, make her number one)
Shes so used to that mentallity, got to hustle hard, riding in the streets
Thats so crazy
Somebodys baby
Going through these things
But I've got love for you and i wanna show you girl
Ohhh
Your friends dont like me
For real though (baby girl)
They say i'm no good for you (ohh)
They're jealous cuz you finally found a good lover
Who only wants the best for you

[Chorus:]
I'm tryin to take you out the hood
Show you something good
Make sure you're ok
Everything is great (everything is great)
You're a superstar
You deserve it all
More than just a ghetto queen (more than just a ghetto queen)
Wanna put you into diamonds
Take you to the islands
Show you everything
You aint never seen
Just let me take you out the hood babe
Let me take you out the hood baby (yeah yeah yeah)
Girl let me change your world for you babe
Take you out the hood

[Verse 2:]
Tell me have you ever seen (white sand on a private beach)
Tell me did you wanna go somewhere (Somewhere you've seen on tv)
Well girl i've got the means to take you anywhere
So dont let your friends cause you to be afraid
They're just lonely
And you're the only
Only thing that matters to me
Even my homies, they gang on me
Cuz they think they could do it for me
Your friends dont like me (your friends dont like me for real)
For real though
They say i'm no good for you (ohh)
They're jealous cuz you finally found a good lover (they are)
Someone that wants the best for you (ohh)

[Chorus:]
I'm tryin to take you out the hood
Show you something good (baby)
Make sure you're ok
Everything is great (oh baby)
You're a superstar
You deserve it all (You're a super star to me)
More than just a ghetto queen (Baby i wanna take you out the hood)
Wanna put you into diamonds
Take you to the islands (Thats where you belong, yeah yeah)
Show you everything
You aint never seen (ohh)
Just let me take you out the hood babe

Girl let me change your world for you babe (For you ohh)
Take you out the hood

[Bridge:]

If you call me

Girl you shine brighter than the moon and the stars
So let me show you something better babe

[Chorus:]
