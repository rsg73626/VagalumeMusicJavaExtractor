[Island Style]
On the island, we do it island style

from the mountain to the ocean

from the windward to the leeward side
(Repeat)


Mama's in the kitchen cooking dinner real nice

Beef stew on the stove, lomi salmon with the ice

We eat and drink and we sing all day

Kanikapila in the old Hawai`ian way

Chorus


We go grandma`s house on the weekend clean yard `cause

If we no go grandma gotta work hard

You know my grandma she like the poi real sour

I love my grandma every minute every hour

Chorus

Instrumental

Repeat 1st verse

Chorus: `s)
