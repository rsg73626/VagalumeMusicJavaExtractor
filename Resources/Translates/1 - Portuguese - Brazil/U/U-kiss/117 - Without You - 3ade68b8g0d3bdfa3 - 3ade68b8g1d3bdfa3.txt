[Without You]

Listen girl, what I’ve done to you, that was my mistake girl
I can’t live without you, yeah, please come back

I love you, baby
I miss you, baby
My life is incomplete
Without you, girl

This song always makes me think of you
Even though I can’t sing it to you now
It’s been a long time since I last felt your touch
And now I miss you

The tears I cry every night, oh baby girl
I think of you every minute, every day
Please, come back to me once again

Without you, I really miss you
Without you, please forgive me
Without you, you’re the only one I love
Can’t live without you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, please come back
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you to comeback girl
Without you, girl

Every moment with you, I never thought you’d leave
I’m hurting because of you, I want you baby girl
Without you I’m lost, boo, I miss you, I miss you
Forget everything and come, come back to me

The tears I cry every night, oh baby girl
I think of you every minute, every day
Please, come back to me once again

Without you, I really miss you
Without you, please forgive me
Without you, you’re the only one I love
Can’t live without you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, please come back
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you to comeback girl
Without you, girl

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I know, you’re my everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I really miss you, come back to me again

Without you, I really miss you
Without you, please forgive me
Without you, you’re the only one I love
Can’t live without you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, please come back
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you to comeback girl
Without you, girl
