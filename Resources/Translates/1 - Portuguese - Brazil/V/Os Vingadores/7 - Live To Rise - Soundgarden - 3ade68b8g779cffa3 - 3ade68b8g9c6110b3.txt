[viver a subir - Soundgarden]

What if all you understand
Could fit into the center of our hand
Then you found it wasn't you
Who held the sum with everything you knew

We're insane but not alone,

You hold on and let go
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again

What if the one thing that I missed
Was everything I need to pass the test
And if I fail what happens then
Can I still count on you as a friend?

We're insane but not alone,

You hold on and let go
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again.. again

Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face

Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise

Oh yeah

Oh yeah
